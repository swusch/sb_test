 pashaine_standing_side_by_side_desc:0 "“We rightly ridicule those who imagine Pashainéy governance as some village mob, for they pose the tyranny of the crowd though it were some novel insight we had yet to consider. Representation, the will of the people, is not a matter of individuals but collectives, corporations of subsets of society each stressing against the other in continuous balance. We are familiar with this in the context of economic guilds, yet the principle extends to separate religious confessions, to political tendencies, and even to mages.\n\n“If Pashainé has innovated upon these ancient ideas, it is only to recognise that the same corporate governance which has made the cities of the Luna so economically powerful may be scaled up to the realm as a whole. This is the basic principle of the cabinet, which under monarchies and republics alike functions as a collective embodiment of government – an executive guild.”\n\nCalmana Alandati, ‘Rule By Group’"

 pashaine_the_corinite_question_desc:0 "“Decisiveness is an end unto itself. The fastest way to elicit a group’s favourite theatre is simply to suggest one you know they despise; this is a principle which the statesman soon learns is terrifyingly applicable to governance. One does not simply analyse a situation and form a position - one forms a position, and a situation develops in response, ad infinitum.”\n\nLamna Nape, ‘The Ethics of Apathy’"

 pashaine_always_on_the_winning_side_desc:0 "“It is thus without exaggeration or reserve that I say the moral duty of a statesman is to be deceptive. Honesty in a position of power is an indulgence of one’s own moral sensitivities – it serves nobody but oneself, and is a betrayal of one’s constituents. For the purpose of a statesman is the advantage of the people, by any means necessary.”\n\nTomas of Vallusna, ‘The Statesman’"

 pashaine_torn_identities_title:0 "Torn Identities"
 pashaine_torn_identities_desc:0 "“The naïve reader may stop here in his reading and ask: if all of this is true, is not the ideal leader a monster? One who reverses himself at a moment’s notice, and neither regrets nor particularly notices the reversal in his position? Such a reader is of course entirely correct. We build our political system on the understanding that great leaders must be a kind of demon, immense in power and efficacy, but shackled by law and precedent to the morality and will of the people.\n\n“Thus the virtue of the state is not beholden to the leader, who by dint of their position must twist and jab, but is founded instead on the principles of the entire structure. The paths of the leader are constrained, and their immense leverage deployed only on behalf of the body politic.”\n\nTomás of Vallusna, ‘The Statesman’"

We recognise more than others that our Pashainéy identity is braided from many fibres, and struggle to explain to outsiders that ‘well, yes, I am Pashainéy, and I’m Menibórian, and I’m Vernman, but also not quite…’\n\n“So it is with God, the fragment and the whole. We Ravelians are not hierophants, so very certain: we are humble, and acknowledge that our lives and our perceptions are only one small part of an immense whole. Yet neither are we mystics: we do not throw up our hands and proclaim the planes unknowable. Instead, we are people of hope, those who know that knowledge arcs towards divine unity – that when we have finally understood the universe, we and it and God will be as one.”\n\nVeridical Effra Angosti, ‘The Collected Sermons’"

In place of ornamental mystery, Ravelian promises revelation. In place of temple autocracy, it promises veridical democracy. Just as the forces of Enlightenment have been put to work rationalising the processes of state, so too does Ravelianism go to work rationalising the processes of belief.”\n\nLeande Bellac, ‘Apologetics’"

To be Anbennarian is nothing more than to do Anbennar – that is, to serve the state, to embody its ideals.

 pashaine_strike_at_the_heart_desc:0 "“Absurdity possesses its own power. What men do not believe they cannot combat, and for as long as one can hold one’s enemies in disbelief, they will fail to adapt. This is the logic of the massacre, which the neophyte often misidentifies as merely an act of terror. Yes, one massacres to inflict fear, or to reduce resistance in a locality. But beyond this, massacre destabilises the survivors, presents even those who were not there with a world utterly changed and unpredictable. The survivor must adapt, and this adaptation takes crucial time.\n\n “In this sense, all spectacle mimics the massacre. The greatest spectacle massacres the symbol – the King forced to kneel, the holy sceptre shattered against flagstone – and makes stunned survivors of entire nations.”\n\nTomás of Vallusna, ‘Essays on Conflict’"

This was the way my Cara danced through the city, through the cafés and across the college quadrangles, past the walking preachers who promised all the secrets of the universe – she brushed gently against everything, pressed down upon nothing. Across twenty neighbourhoods I chased that silk, and still that silk for me is the city, the conversation faintly carrying from the window, the million-strong coffee house chatter of eternity.”\n\nEdoro Meniá, ‘Six Loves in the Metropole’"

We are told this is how we retain our independent souls! We are told to fear the coming of the Pashainéy, but in truth it is they who represent continuity, they who accord far more with the natural spirit of we cosmopolitan island folk. Brothers and sisters of Tef: let the crumbling plaster fall from the wall of this house. The stone beneath is beautiful!” \n\nPaolu Orma, ‘Eight Arguments for Defeat’"

Indeed the entire showing, set off by the gleam of Col. Amati’s boots and buttons, played to great effect. For it is a truth universally acknowledged that a young Guardsman, possessed of a decent civic commission, must be in want of a wife.”\n\nYael Estella, ‘Speaker’s Square’"

 pashaine_one_god_one_people_desc:0 "“I say again that zealotry is in essence impossible in the name of Ravelianism, for unique among all creeds yet practiced, the purpose of Ravelianism is not obedience but understanding. The purpose of zealotry is to close the mind and funnel the believer towards a single creed, while the purpose of the Ravelian evangelist is to broaden it. Pay no heed to those who would defend the right to wallow in ill-purpose, to turn away from understanding. Allow not the ignorant to limit themselves.”\n\nVeridical Pasha Mirenda, ‘The Expository Principle’"

 pashaine_the_virtous_nation_title:0 "The Virtuous Nation"
 pashaine_the_virtous_nation_desc:0 "“The principle of Pashainéy political thought is that the body politic constrains the individual. The individual flame of brilliance at the heart of the statesman is braced all around in iron, the foibles of the one counterbalanced: first by the needs and will of the body they represent, and second by the resistance of the bodies with which they jostle to influence state action.\n\nBy such means the state itself is rendered one great body, possessed of a principle, personality and virtue independent of its individual constituents. The leader need not be saintly – indeed, he is often called by duty to be the opposite – for he is inevitably bound by the nature of the state, restrained by a bureaucracy inculcated from birth to defend that nature."\n\nCasmil Vacq, ‘The Spirit Of The State’"

Pleasure-craft ambled along the waterfront in a manner which only in these past twenty years could be said to have shaken off an imitation of Esmaria, for they were now made up in a gilt-ivory fashion quite their own, no longer so adolescent and self-conscious.

 flavour_pashaine.1.d:0 "How many in the history of Cannor have comforted themselves with the inevitability of imperfection? All in their position must compromise, all must give way and corrupt themselves eventually. Such thinking has allowed the conniving and the weak to slip in amongst the works of government, to undermine the good functioning of the state.\n\nPut simply, the virtuous must aim for virtue – we who seek a new kind of society must resist the urge to indulge ourselves in our mistakes. This experiment, this Pashainé, is far too important. Recognising that the executive, holding a position of power, must be left free to do what must be done, we also recognise that they require restraint. Thus the virtues of our philosophy become the virtues of our state, informed by the myriad influences on our noble realm."

The Pashainéy had chosen a mocking sequence, marking the hours in the merry way the market-bells did, all the better to remind the people of Istralore that their government had been mocked by the petty shopkeepers of the Luna. Mere “practice manoeuvres’’, so went the official line, and of course the baldness of the lie was itself a mockery. \n\nThe lesson? That pity and sympathy mean little in the wake of abject weakness. It did not matter, in the weeks that followed, that Istralore was considered entirely on the correct side of things. No envoy in the Diet, not even the Pashainéy silver-tongues, would deny over a private drink that this was a deliberate provocation. But such points of etiquette matter little when a greater truth is being spelled out: Istralore’s traditional chokehold on the position of Marshal has been thoroughly shown up."

In Pashainé, we revere the clever seneschal.\n\nHe leaves his mark not in stories but in legislation; he may speak eloquently, but rarely stirringly. And yet, we must ask ourselves this: whose rules do we follow, many centuries hence, when we wake and go to market and must pay a penny on our daily wares? The hero wins a half hour of your attention at the tavern, at most. The statesman reaches into your purse, every single day of your life.\n\nThis is the principle of our new Imperial Chancellorship. The tedious and the foolish question why we would forgo the opportunity to claim the Empire for ourselves – they do not recognise that we already have. Let foppish aristocrats sprawl their legs across the throne itself, while we rebuild the palace around them.\n\nThe first of our chancellors rises to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. The ceremony is not terribly well-attended; it takes place in a wing of the Imperial palace more generally used for housing guests. No matter.

These mage-lifted lanterns were just the thing, glowing hazy in the night, blinding them all to everything but the barge.\n\n“Does this feel like a joke?” Casmil asked, and Orro found himself reluctantly smiling. It took all the certainty he had to rest his head on Casmil’s shoulder. Casmil was not the perfect-third taller than him, but Orro found that this did not matter.\n\nIn a few hours, this ball would end. There would be fifty more this season, all leading up to the great event in Port Munas, which he and Casmil were hardly important enough to attend.

Prosperity made people kind, he said - made everybody a guildsman to everybody else.\n\n“Reassure me again,” Orro said, but there was a sly smile on his face now. He liked to hear Casmil argue, to declaim at the world; he’d liked it back in the chancellery, too, when Casmil was just first conceiving his great scheme of things.

This is included but not limited to: the leaking of ministerial information to Magisterial officials, the active funding of Magisterial institutions within Pashainé which attempted the same, the open libel of Pashainéy government institutions, expressions of sympathy for counter-governmental action within Pashainé on the part of domestic or foreign entities, and the expression of sympathy for magocratic rule now proscribed under the Witch-King Act.\n\nAn organised programme of funding for Luna River mages in Magisterial institutions is observed until approximately a year before the attempted magocratic coup. This programme appears to have been deliberately obfuscated through the division of such informal scholarships among several private citizens of the Upper Luna; such efforts point to organisation of the coup across international borders, perhaps even on the part of the Magisterium itself.\n\nAt this time, the Subcommittee for Institutional Dearcanisation recommends the immediate imprisonment of any mage funded in the above manner, or found to be guilty of the abovementioned offences. In cases where imprisonment-and-nullification protocols are unlikely to result in the successful dampening of magical power we authorise summary deportation, excepting of course where the offence in question falls under the capital punishment clause of the Treason Act."

She would present only a part of the evidence – that which related to magocratic funding acquired through sympathetic contacts in other guilds. Her evidence dealt with the opportunists, largely not present in the courtroom; those who had professed loyalty to Pashainéy virtues while funnelling a little to the seditionists. Insurance, should the mages succeed. It was an instinct many Pashainéy would publicly decry and privately understand – it was the smart thing for a merchant to do in uncertain times.\n\nSuch opportunists had hoped to play both sides; they had lost the coinflip. The Pashainéy would understand the impulse, but they would not back a loser. Her evidence was a fait accompli. Indeed, she could’ve recited it by heart – she only kept rifling through her papers because of the mage at the front, the woman with the arrogant expression. \n\nGinette couldn’t help it. She made eye contact, bore into the woman with all the fury she felt as a woman born of Pashainé, as a woman who had dedicated her life to these fussy, disputatious institutions which were the very stuff of democracy.

They’d half-frozen to death, their coats on the whole time, but it had kept them sharp, kept them working. This was important, this part – it was vital that they could prove what the mages had done, not merely purge them in the manner of a courtier fallen from favour. All of this – every judgement – needed to happen in view of the people.\n\nOne moment, Hercel was approaching the point of his most full-throated denunciation; the next, he was in flames, and there was the low rumbling of an explosion from somewhere else in the courthouse, and everything was chaos. Later, Ginette would mull that they had probably chosen the moment of the speech precisely: the point at which Hercel had been arguing most passionately for the virtue of people’s rule, the point and promise of a guild of citizens. It was, she realised, a mockery.\n\nIn the moment she merely knelt over his body, until long after the mageflame had burned itself out, and stared at his terrible, burned corpse. They hadn’t known each other before this. They were distant colleagues at best, left to argue this case on behalf of government – volunteering! – because they both truly believed. In normal conversation, he did this annoying sniff every sentence and a half; it was unbearable. All that disappeared before the people’s court, just as her nasal, anxious tone acquired a note of deepness. It was the dignity of the state, the virtue of Pashainé flowing through them both.\n\nThe mages couldn’t understand that. They simply could not subordinate themselves to something greater. They had run for their fellows, for the only ones they respected - other mages – rather than face the judgement of the body politic. \n\nShe realised, with a hushed surprise, that she truly hated them."

She had watched Hercel die in front of her, and she had been changed.\n\n“Parliamentarians,” she called out, her voice deep and dignified, “In days to come the judgement of our inquest will be published in full. I am deputised to inform Parliament of our verdict in brief, and empower you to act upon it.” She swallowed – not nerves. Anticipation, maybe even glee.\n\n“We of the panel recommend the immediate and utter dissolution of any and all mages’ guilds in Pashainé, until such time as Parliament can arrange the establishment of a new form of magical state organisation. We find that the structure of such guilds – and indeed of Anbennarian magical education as a whole – is fundamentally incompatible with the representative guild structure, and should be given no legal standing.

Our major Cannorian rivals could then be relied upon to support chaos in Pashainé for their own purposes.\n\nIn regards to Wex, we have found systematic evidence of plans to encroach upon or outright conquer the Luna River, dating back to the fifteenth century.

Or perhaps they simply wanted to prove even the superiority of their pillage.\n\n No better example, of course, than the Palace. Thousands of soldiers working over several weeks dismantled the entire thing from top to bottom, down to the ornamentation. All to be shipped away to [Root.Capital.GetName] and reassembled.

The principles of discovery and meaning, the reading groups, the veneration of figures who did something, who built something; all of this fit naturally over the guild structure, over the existing instincts of the Pashainéy people.\n\nAnd so it is natural now that a Veridical cohort full of Pashainéy puppets, even those from foreign climes, rallies behind Pashainéy domination of the Rectorate.

Our openness is vulnerability as well as strength, however, and we must be ever vigilant against the mind-altering corruption of the School of Enchantment, which seeks to subvert the representative process.\n\nIn recent days, the corporatist clique have brought us alarming reports of a Member voting against his clique to weaken the privileges of his local guild. Such a profound reversal in an individual normally so staunchly defensive of guild rights is a worrying sign of magical alteration, and many are calling for him to be immediately impeached."

As active participants in Imperial decision-making and enthusiastic self-advocates, we have greased the wheels of the Diet and built up a strong reputation for diplomacy and tenacity. It is time we cashed that reputation in.\n\nThe situation in Pashainé cannot be allowed to continue. Magical subversion and the anti-democratic influence of magical lobbies undermine our very way of life, eroding the institutions which make Pashainé great. We will not be made into some arcane autocracy, chafing under the whim of some addled, megalomaniacal scholar. We must call upon the Empire to intervene in our favour, chastening the mages and bringing seditious elements to heel.\n\nThe letter is signed; the Diet is addressed.

The brush-off, when it came, bore an Imperial seal.\n\n“Internal troubles must be resolved by internal strength. The Empire is a shield, not a crutch.”\n\nAn echoing, furious silence followed the reading in the Chamber of Representatives. Two hundred years of Imperial participation – not always loyal to the current Emperor but always invested, always recognising fundamentally the legitimacy of the Imperial throne – ended in but a moment."

 pashaine_chancellor_honeyed_words_title:0 "The Chancellor’s Word"
 pashaine_chancellor_honeyed_words_desc:0 "Our control of the Imperial chancellorship gives us unparalleled access to the institutions of Imperial bureaucracy. We can deploy this influence and reputation to achieve a number of things: friendly faces in the Diet, subsidies for those who might otherwise oppose us, favourable legal judgements, and so on. In so doing, we smooth our uninterrupted course to power."

 #Estate Stuff
 estate_mages_prelude_to_greatness:0 "Prelude To Greatness"
 estate_mages_prelude_to_greatness_desc:0 "The Pashainéy state is gripped by paranoid deadlock, undermined by a conspiracy of noble mages who resent the state’s treatment of magical organisations as merely single guilds among many. Trust has broken down across the institutions of Pashainé, as mages refuse to serve the state and the structures of governance fall into paranoid pursuit of hidden, internal enemies."
 estate_burghers_committe_of_urban_development:0 "Commitee Of Urban Development"
 estate_burghers_committe_of_urban_development_desc:0 "A parliamentary special commission comprising elite architectural guilds and provincial MPs in close partnership, the CUD is charged with the rapid development and standardisation of Pashainé’s many urban centres. Demolishing the rickety, cramped feudal centres of such cities, the CUD organises and funds their replacement with the elegant apartment blocks, wide streets and covered markets which are required for a truly modern city."
 estate_artificers_organization_strict_state_supervision:0 "Strict State Supervision"
 estate_artificers_organization_strict_state_supervision_desc:0 "Pashainéy hostility towards unchecked magical power extends beyond mages to the artificery guilds. While still allowed to exist independently of the government, such guilds must work within extremely carefully prescribed limits and publish regular reports of their damestear use to Parliament. The result is slow, cautious progress and a research philosophy which only reluctantly pursues military artificery.\n[Root.getArtificeryBreakdownShort]"

 estate_adventurers_bellacaire_sappers:0 "Bellacair Sappers"
 estate_adventurers_bellacaire_sappers_desc:0 "What martial doctrine emerges from a city of mercy, where for so long the driving mission was the provision of battlefield medicine? One grounded in complex logistics and the power of administration; one focused on the whole, not the part. In Bellacaire’s case, this has meant the inexorable progress of the artillery corps, the systematic organisation of the sapper. Bellacaire legionaries know that what is great can scarcely be glimpsed by a single soul; they know that we all die without each other."
 estate_adventurers_napesbay_squadron:0 "Napesbay Squadron"
 estate_adventurers_napesbay_squadron_desc:0 "The boys of Napesbay learn from childhood to wander across the sea-slick wood of the harbourlands, their bare feet gripping on the teak. Little wonder that the Napesbay legionaries feel no fear for water, that they are just at home as sailing men as they are wielding the bayonet. It is a point of pride for the Napesbayer legionaries that they must specialise in two worlds, where all the other legions hyperspecialise."
 estate_adventurers_menibor_vanguard:0 "Menibor Vanguard"
 estate_adventurers_menibor_vanguard_desc:0 "Just as their adventurer ancestors risked everything in the pursuit of glory, so do the Menibór Guards charge heedlessly into danger. Theirs is the legion of heroes, the place of those who cannot abide injustice and who will not yield to the cowardice of caution. Bring your hopeless causes, your uphill struggles - the children of the Loop will meet them all with a laugh."
 estate_adventurers_bluehart_finest:0 "Bluehart Finest"
 estate_adventurers_bluehart_finest_desc:0 "The legacy of Dameria is erudite; it is the honing of skill, of specialisation. The Bluehart Guards are expected to spend as much time in the library as on the practice range, are expected to comprehend the theoretical underpinnings of their small-squad tactics. The result is a corps of highly-trained sharpshooters, capable of hammering opposition as one or splitting into finely-drilled subgroups. The accuracy of their volleys is second to none."

 palace_of_unity_desc:0 "It is a fairytale thing, to tear down a building and remake it again elsewhere – yet in such a spectacle, real meaning is found. Just as the borders of our Empire superficially resemble the old, the Palace of Unity resembles the Imperial Palace of old; yet it is a fundamentally different thing, a building intended for an entirely different purpose.\n\nOnce our Pashainéy envoys walked the halls of this place as supplicants and wheedlers, cleverly building influence and protecting their fragile realm – now, the people’s clerks, administrators and representatives work for the good of us all. The dynastic feuding of old Anbennar has given way to a state which serves the many, not the few. See every statue anew; take stock once more of each chamber. They have been changed forever."


 #Gov Reforms
 blackpowder_resistance:0 "Blackpowder Resistance"
 blackpowder_resistance_desc:0 "Emerging from corporatist principles of a balance of citizen bodies in a given state, Pashainé is ever-wary of those bodies which threaten to achieve outsize power. Most prominent among these are the mages and artificers, whose distinct abilities and institutional solidarity pose a perennial threat to the ideal and equal ‘Guild of Citizens’ which is so key to Pashainéy thought."
 puppeting_the_rectorate:0 "Puppeting The Rectorate"
 puppeting_the_rectorate_desc:0 "The Council of Veridicals has been entirely subjected to Parliament, the High Rector and Provosts now appointed by a nominally independent Parliamentary subcommittee from a group of candidates presented by the Council. The result is a Ravelian faith loyal to government and aligned with Pashainéy state policy. Though some radical Ravelians have elected Anti-Veridicals to resist this move, they are profoundly marginalised and hold little real power."
 blackpowder_commonwealth_republic:0 "Blackpowder Commonwealth"
 blackpowder_commonwealth_republic_desc:0 "Pashainéy representation is conceptualised in blocs, emerging from the guild representation system which dominated the city-republics of the pre-Pashainé Luna. Constituency seats representing one’s locality are combined with parliamentary seats for major industries, consultative groups and species; a relatively powerful Parliamentary executive is constrained by highly influential confidence votes. The result is that a single person may be represented multiple times – for example, as a resident of a given city, as a textile guild-member, as a kobold, and as a renter."
 blackpowder_commonwealth_monarchy:0 "Blackpowder Commonwealth"
 blackpowder_commonwealth_monarchy_desc:0 "Pashainéy representation is conceptualised in blocs, emerging from the guild representation system which dominated the city-republics of the pre-Pashainé Luna. Constituency seats representing one’s locality are combined with parliamentary seats for major industries, consultative groups and species; the monarch is bound to respect the will of their parliamentary cabinet, which is in turn constrained by highly influential confidence votes. The result is that a single person may be represented multiple times – for example, as a resident of a given city, as a textile guild-member, as a kobold, and as a renter."
 economic_heart_of_cannor:0 "Economic Heart Of Cannor"
 economic_heart_of_cannor_desc:0 "The Pashainéy economy practices extensive vertical integration, aiming to process goods as close to their point of extraction as is physically possible. Imports are limited to raw materials unobtainable within Pashainéy borders, while entire industries are hyper-localised to enormous, government-recognised proto-industrial complexes. The result is a highly integrated network of guild cities with immense productive capacity and concentration of expertise."
