 khetarch_events.1.d:0 "Khetarch Amiskhet III was growing tired of the mundane. His servants began to take notice, from subtle sighs under his breath to refusing to leave his room for days at a time. Finally, one daring servant asked him what was the matter. The Khetarch in his divine brilliance replied that he grew bored of the typical, and that there must be more beyond the lands of Kheterata, be it new innovations or foreign lands that would excite him. He lazily rolled over the edge of his bed so he could eye the servant upside down and get chin scratches, and muttered “Ashes of the civil war still taint these lands.”\n\nHis servants set to work, but they were not quite sure what he wanted; was it an overseas empire? A unified nation? Advancements in technology? Whatever would come of the new era, his servants reassured him that new luxuries would be found to spoil him, and that seemed to please the Khet who continued to lie about his palace and do as little as possible.

He decided to take a walk, his every step falling upon a hastily arranged carpet so he never set foot on the ground itself. He came upon a small human child, and sat for a moment watching the child play. After a couple moments of watching, he realized just how dumb this child was. Swords don't swing like that, and a twig wouldn't be an effective weapon at all! By his will, the stick crumbled into dust, and he left the child crying both in sadness and in awe at the Khet's divine radiance. His scribes quickly made note, writing that “The Khet's bodyguards need better weapons.”  They would make sure that the personal bodyguards of the Khet left their relics behind for the new advanced weapons of the modern age. If they wanted to make the Khet happy they would need to make sure that everyone knew this. After all, an informed guard makes marginally better cannon fodder. Right?"

He would sit and toss crowns in the air, rolling them between his fingers, rubbing them against his fur and whiskers. He loved them, and his servants made note of this, doing everything in their power to supply him with as many as possible.\n\n Strangely, as many as they gave him from the nation's income, from their personal treasuries, and from spoils of war, there always seemed to be room for more. They weren't sure what he did with them, but as long as it kept him appeased did it really matter? After all, there was something nice about his purring when brought full sacks of them. One servant even swears she saw him eat one once! Surely that can't be true? Right?"

Khetarch Sematkhet II knows this to be true, and his most loyal servants find themself rapidly in positions of higher importance, gaining the chance to serve him more. He is happier than he's ever been surrounded by those who adore him, who would gladly throw their bodies to the floor to act as a cushion for his feet lest a speck of dirt or dust touch his immaculate form. His legions swear loyalty not to the country, or the king, but to him, for he is the Khetarch. Sure, he doesn't bother to use those legions, and they're mostly for show, but if he did try and use them he could! They are the best trained in all of Kheterata! At giving him chin scratches and pets, feeding him and making him happy. At least that's something; who needs to fight when you can bathe in reverence at the divine glory of the khet!"\

People with no ability to do anything on their own, who lacked independence, and relied on him for everything. It was exhausting.\n\n The only solution was for the court to be purged, and pure loyalists replaced with loyalists who actually knew what they were doing. This would be no small feat; even with his guidance the people would need reassurance that things would be okay, that the hardships could be endured. The nation would be stable and everything would work out in the end. Time to find someone to give a speech for him."

The military had been trained and built up over decades waiting for the perfect time to strike.\n\n Khetarch Amenkhet IV, however was busy the morning the war came, getting a lovely massage with some chin scratches from one of his servants. It was divine, as was any activity in which he was involved! He stretched and sat up, the servants bowing and backing away in fear as he looked at the Steward before him waiting for his blessing. The Khet simply nodded and the Steward walked to the balcony and began to command the generals, the legions, to march. For victory, for glory, for Kheterata, for the Khet!"
