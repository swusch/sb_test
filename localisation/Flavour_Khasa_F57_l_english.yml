  khasa_revitalizing_the_coast_desc:0 "“With the gnolls all but routed and my people freed, the time has come to direct my attention inwards. Our fields lie fallow, and our children grow hungry. Although it will take a great deal of effort, we should seek to revitalize our farmland to ensure that no child of Mother Akasik goes hungry.\n\n“Khasa has always had the great fortune of owning the most fertile land in all of Akasik even if the Kult has made its best effort to make it seem otherwise. Under their negligent stewardship the land has become barren and desolate. My kin have suffered for long enough under the gnolls, I will not let hunger take anyone who has survived the gnollish depredations.”"

  khasa_enfold_the_republic_desc:0 "[GetKhasaMissionText]"
  khasa_ekha_spawn:0 "“The port city of Ekha has always been of vital importance to Akasik, serving as the main point of connection between Fangaula and the Divenhal. And while the Silver Council has been a fickle vassal of ours through the ages, the current Amsaches seems to be keenly aware of the ancient vows of loyalty they once professed. With the republic back under our stewardship, the time has come to bring Ekha, the Herald of Civilization, fully under our control, for a united Akasik requires complete unity amongst our peoples, not just mere lip service to the idea of Akasi solidarity.”"
  khasa_not_ekha_spawn:0 "“If we are to ensure the future flourishing of our resurrected kingdom, control over Divenhali trade must be secured. Control over the city of Ekha, famous all across the Divenhal for its role as the primary link between Fangaula and the Divenhal, is vital for this aim.\n\n“In times of yore, before the elemental wars, the Silver Republic professed its loyalty to the Kekhasa dynasty. Faced with our sudden resurrection, the Silver Council of Ekha seems to have recalled once more the oaths of loyalty they once professed to my ancestors and now have expressed a desire to join together as one. In exchange for greater autonomy in the city, as is tradition of course, the traders promise to throw their full support behind ensuring Khasani dominance over the Divenhal.”"

  khasa_preparing_supplies_title:0 "Preparing Supplies"
  khasa_preparing_supplies_desc:0 "“Aur-Kes-Akasik, the ancient capital of Akasik, is finally back under my control. These ancient halls that saw me grow up, and where I first claimed ownership of Tajan, the storm caller, have many stories to tell. Some of whom date back millenia, first carved from stone by the Shaytan, then turned into the stronghold of the Stone Giants and finally claimed as the demesne of the Storm Queens of old. This palace complex has fallen into disrepair from the centuries of neglect and the recent decades of struggle, even during our last golden age it was overlooked in favour of the prosperous cities that dotted the coast, so it is little wonder that it is naught but a shadow of what it once was.\n\n“Before we can hope to refurbish this ancient seat of power, however, we must rebuild the trade roads and fortresses that once secured this region. Fortunately our city of Khasa makes an excellent staging ground for this endeavour. By refurbishing the gold mines of the area the gnolls once razed we can acquire the necessary funds for such an ambitious plan.”"

  khasa_moving_back_in_title:0 "Moving Back In"
  khasa_moving_back_in_desc:0 "“With the infrastructure now in place, we can finally begin the restoration of Aur-Kes-Akasik to its ancient glory, and move my court to this great palace. This is to be a message for all, proclaiming that I am the sole liege lord of all lands under our Mother’s shadow. The long-neglected gardens, hydraulic systems and ancient enchantments may have seen better days, but with plenty of effort and coin, we can once more bring back the ancient magic that made this palace one of the ancient wonders of the Divenhal.”"
  khasa_life_on_the_ocean_title:0 "Life On The Ocean"
  khasa_life_on_the_ocean_desc:0 "“Tajan, one of the few surviving testaments to the Storm Queens’ power, has been a vital boon in both reclaiming our home and in keeping it safe from invaders beyond the Divenhal. I still keenly remember the first time I was taught to use its power, and I first felt its power…  something ineffably ancient.\n\n“This relic has not only proven to be a magnificent boon to our fleets who guard our shoreline; local fishermen all throughout Akasik have reported supernaturally bountiful catches during the months of the storm. By investing into the coastal infrastructure in key provinces, we may capitalize on this unexpected economic boon brought on by this ancient part of our inheritance.”"

  khasa_divenhal_diplomacy_title:0 "Divenhal Diplomacy"
  khasa_divenhal_diplomacy_desc:0 "“For so long, my ancestors have sought to establish strong bonds with the Cannorians across the Divenhal, with Tretun once being our most stalwart allies among them. Our relations have not been so amicable with all of them however. Such as the Tefori which have so ardently sought dominion over Akasik and the Deshkura, wishing to gain hegemony over the Divengate. Or our rocky relations with the wyvern kings of Verne, at times a strong bond, and at others a soft rivalry, so unlike the enduring close connections between Ekha and the Sorncósti. And of course we should not forget what the reavers took from us, and the ancient sin of the Pearlsedgers.\n\n“All this is old history, however, and now that we are resurgent and my people have proven our claim as the rightful rulers of all of Akasik, I should seek to re-establish relations with our old allies beyond the waves in the interest of mutual prosperity.”"
  khasa_from_the_ashes_title:0 "From The Ashes"
  khasa_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "“For many years I have been naught but the prince that was promised to my people, not living breathing Bashal Kekhasa but just a comforting fairy tale to ease their minds while they toiled and suffered under unending demonflame. Today they will crown me as king, and now comes my time to atone for all the years I have spent being powerless, nothing but a faint glimmer of hope in their hearts.\n\n“My people are the rightful owners of all lands under our Mother’s shadow and true inheritors of the legacy of the Storm Queens.. Though we have been remiss in our duty to care for the land entrusted to us. Our fields lie fallow and in disrepair, and although their armies have been driven out, gnollish warbands still roam the countryside, seeking to reverse the tide of history and once again lay claim to rightfully Akasi lands, to put us under their yoke once more.\n\n“I will raise an army worthy of defending Akasik, and petition our Deshaki sister for the return of my demesne as well as the place of my upbringing, Aur-kes-Akasik. Only when all is put back in order can we begin to truly heal.”\n\n- From the diary of Bashal Kekhasa"
  khasa_new_ideas_across_the_sea_title:0 "New Ideas Across The Sea"
  khasa_new_ideas_across_the_sea_desc:0 "“During the time my people have spent fighting the gnolls and resisting their yoke we have been unable to contact our old allies in Cannor which has left us in a precarious diplomatic position. Even as thanks to them our lands lay ruined and our defenses are vulnerable against a new invasion, the gnolls, despicable as they are, did show us one thing: our methods of warfare are woefully antiquated, we have become too comfortable in our prolonged isolation from world events, mistaking it for safety, and unless we change, the tides of time may yet swallow us whole.\n\n“But as the Lilac Wars have come to a close and the old status quo is shattered, a unique opportunity presents itself before us, as the coasts of the Divenhal stir with new movements and ideas. We can take advantage of the upheaval to reconnect with friends both old and new, and when I send my diplomats to the lands beyond Her shadow they shall bring back with them more than just honeyed words and letters of congratulation, for knowledge is the greatest prize we can acquire.”"
  khasa_across_the_sea_tt:0 "Any 2 known countries of different culture groups:\n   Has embraced §YRenaissance§!\n   Opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§! is at least §Y100§!.\n   Capital:\n      Is on the continent §YCannor§!"

  khasa_the_chosen_of_akasik_title:0 "The Chosen Of Akasik"
  khasa_the_chosen_of_akasik_desc:0 "“During the Age of Storms, when our fair Storm Queens ruled this land, before Ekha and Deshak were even a wisp of an idea, it was Khasa that arose, under the shade of Aur-Kes-Akasik we flourished under the benevolent guidance of the Queens. And when the age of the river came and the Khet dared to put Akasik under their yoke it was us who threw the first stone and dared to seek the aid of Dameria to free us from their grasp. Lastly, when in due time Shedorikh the Great came to rule Akasik, Khasa was his first chosen seat of power.\n\n“And now that we find ourselves navigating beyond the guiding lights of bygone eras it falls to us once more to act as wayfinders for our kin and show them the way forward. For we have always been the chosen of Akasik, first of Her children.”"
  khasa_filling_the_throne_title:0 "Filling The Throne"
  khasa_filling_the_throne_desc:0 "“The King of Eborthíl once came to speak with me during a banquet in Verne and said,\n\n    ‘Young king, both your kindness and fierceness are well known across these waves we all command with virtue and righteousness; my court speaks of your prowess and your judiciousness unmatched by all, even at your young age; surely a mind as keen as yours can see the benefits of cooperation and closer ties will bring to us all.\n    ‘You see, my daughter is seeking a promising match such as yourself and I hope we may find common ground through ties of blood.’\n\n“My answer to his proposal was a simple question:\n\n    ‘Will my people have to come along with me, bound by these new bonds you seek to forge?’\n\n“As his answer was, of course, evasive, I found myself obliged to refuse his suggestion, for I am the last of not only the Kekhasa line but of the Stormbreakers; and the throne of Deshak is mine, by blood.”"

  khasa_heeding_the_call_title:0 "Heeding The Call"
  khasa_heeding_the_call_desc:0 "“The Oliphant Horns are a beautiful pair of horns engraved in Akasik script with the finest of silver, one of which was granted to the kings of Tretun centuries ago as a symbol of our eternal friendship with them. But they serve another purpose, for whenever either of our great realms was threatened its Oliphant could be sounded, and the sound would ring out from both horns at the same time, signalling the need for assistance, and for centuries, each realm would come to the aid of the other unflinchingly…\n\n“Until the arrival of the scourge, that is. The gnolls awaited an opportune moment to strike when our brothers once more called for us in their moment of need. Faced with their invasion, my father could do little but rescind our aid in the desperate hope of ensuring our own survival, and even that was not enough for us to withstand the onslaught.\n\n“In the end both of our realms fell, in what they now name “The Last Call of the Oliphant Horns”. We will never allow that tragic chapter of our shared history to repeat itself, however, for as long as either of our peoples still draw breath we will come to the aid of our brothers.”"

  khasa_restoring_the_mountains_title:0 "Restoring The Mountains"
  khasa_restoring_the_mountains_desc:0 "“Most foreigners think that the peaks of Akasik are little more than lifeless barren crags, but this couldn’t be further from the truth, for atop our Mother’s peaks we flourish like no one else could. Yet the recent depredations of the gnolls have turned what once was a prosperous land of secluded verdant dales into a graveyard of bones and the remains of pyres where our sisters were slaughtered still stain the soil.\n\n“I fear I cannot hope to recover all that we have lost in my lifetime, but if with my labour I am able to recover just a fraction of what we have lost and soothe even a fraction of the pain endured by our sisters, then my efforts will not have been in vain.”"
  khasa_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
  khasa_never_again_desc:0 "“Blood… Blood and guts are all I remember of the two harpies that served as my guards and nursemaids, the ones that carried me out of the palace and hid me when the gnolls assaulted my father’s city. After all these years I don’t even remember their names or their faces. They gave their lives for me, for their ‘sweet prince’ as they were apt to say, much like many of the Stonewings gave their lives for us Khasani, to halt the gnollish advance.\n\n“And for that, it is my duty as king to do my utmost to restore their roosts and homes, so that the few survivors have a place to return to and call home once more. And once this is done I intend to make sure such a tragedy never unfolds again. We will chase the Seascourge to the depths of the unforgiving Salahad and there we will land the finishing blow. My people won’t take more suffering from them, not again, never again.”"
  khasa_supplying_the_hurkashu_title:0 "Supplying The Hurkashu"
  khasa_supplying_the_hurkashu_desc:0 "“Long ago when Menkaunswt the warrior king took Akasik he taught us a valuable lesson about the value of a well supplied and well directed army. Our ancestors were confident in their skills and in their ability to use our knowledge of our Mother’s body to our advantage, but the innovative tactics and fierce steel of his army smashed through our lines and broke through even the sturdiest of our fortifications.\n\n“The Hurkashu are an ancient order founded as a direct consequence of his conquest, the first successful subjugation of Akasik since the times of Elikhet, a brotherhood of warriors where those of our kin who admired the ancient king’s tactics and wished to emulate them gathered.\n\n“And they have learned well from him indeed, forming the first among equals in our army. It is only prudent to grant them the required resources and command authority to turn our military into a force to be reckoned with.”"

  flavour_khasa.010.t:0 "A Storm Approaches"
  flavour_khasa.010.d1:0 "Rumbling is heard in the distance and the skies tremble in anticipation, a storm will soon be upon us. Children of Akasik, prepare! For under its shadow in the middle of the maelstrom is where we thrive. Let those who do not know of His grace cower, for it seems Father Aiji smiles upon us today!"
  flavour_khasa.010.d2:0 "The skies and the earth tremble as the sound of a terrifying storm approaches, once more the Akasi use their genie relics and elemental magic to cover the Divenhal under a dense shroud of thunder and darkness. We must prepare for the coming devastation approaching our shores, and if we happen to survive it we may even see the bounty that comes with the storms."
  flavour_khasa.010.a:0 "We thank you for this chance to prove ourselves, o Father!"
  flavour_khasa.010.b:0 "Prepare, for the lightning spares none."
  flavour_khasa.011.t:0 "The Verdant Dawn"
  flavour_khasa.011.d1:0 "After the storm stills its fury, in its wake only greenery and dew are left, and a verdant realm is reborn, for while the downpour brings naught but death to those that dare threaten Akasik, to us children of this land life is the greatest gift of the storm."
  flavour_khasa.011.d2:0 "The storm has passed finally and after an almost continuous year of steady downpour the land begins to recover from its effects. While it surely was devastating, we have managed to weather its worst effects and now we can focus on reaping the rewards of our endurance and hard labour."
  flavour_khasa.011.a:0 "We thank you for this bounty, o Father!"
  flavour_khasa.011.b:0 "At least we may yet salvage something."
  flavour_khasa.130.t:0 "Request to Return Desh-Al-Akasik"
  flavour_khasa.130.d1:0 "Our restored neighbors to the west, Khasa, have sent an emissary to our courts with a proposal. Having pushed the gnolls out of the heartland of Akasik, Prince Bashal asks that we return to him his demesne of Aur-kes-Akasik.\n\nAn outrageous demand, given that we clearly are the rightful lords of Akasik, as we are the only ones to have successfully repelled the gnolls. But perhaps it would be worth acquiescing to their demand in this instance, in the hopes of building up relations with our fellow children of Akasik so that we may finally free ourselves of Cannorian influence, together."
  flavour_khasa.130.d2:0 "Recently, an emissary has reached our court from the newly formed Akasi nation of Khasa. Bearing gifts of Shakhat and spices, this diplomat has humbly requested our acknowledgement of their rightful claim to the ancient province of Aur-Kes-Akasik, which we have inherited from our Deshaki vassals across the Divenhal.\n\nWhile this territory is helpful in securing our trade ports along the coast, which play a vital role in maintaining our influence over trade in the western Divenhal, it may be more valuable to ingratiate ourselves with the growing kingdom, especially if they continue to be successful. Having a powerful ally guarding our interests in Sarhal could be an unmitigated boon."
  flavour_khasa.130.a:0 "Give this prince his demense."
  flavour_khasa.130.b:0 "Akasik's heritage belongs to its saviours."

  flavour_khasa.131.d:0 "“The envoy I sent out has just returned from our neighbors to the east with glorious news: in the interest of further cooperation, my rightful inheritance has been returned to us, with Aur-Kes-Akasik once more under the control of the house of Kekhasa. I can now finally begin to restore the venerable palace and its halls that saw me grow up and showed me so much of what it meant to rule and of what a king must be, not only for the good of the realm, but also for his people.”"
  flavour_khasa.131.a:0 "“At last, home”"
  flavour_khasa.340.t:0 "An Akasi Monarch"
  flavour_khasa.340.d:0 "“FOOLS!” A scream breaks the perfect silence in the court as the count of Mushesh speaks. “You would let a foreign king tread on our sacred grounds and rule over our people, do you have no pride?! Have you forgotten your oaths? We are sworn servants of the king, and that king is not the dragon that holds us in thrall at the other side of the Deshkura! Bashal is the blood of our deceased princess, he is our rightful king! I will not stay silent while you keep our liege lord from his throne!”\n\nA voice from across the council chamber chimes in, the Duke of Ari-Ifan pouncing on the opportunity to belittle his rival: “Now, now, Akhil, let us be reasonable, the boy is barely 17, he is not fit to rule over Akasik yet, we are much safer under the watch of…”\n\nThe sound of breaking glass interrupts the duke’s craven rhetoric. “Safe? Safe?! Each of us treasuring our own safety before that of the rest of our kin is how Akasik died, and... I... will… not… stand idly by while you lot ABANDON OUR MOTHER ONCE MORE!”"
  flavour_khasa.340.a:0 "Daggers shine and blood flies, thus is the way a prince becomes a king."
  flavour_khasa.340.b:0 "Akhil's blood stained the carpet, the prince would stay a prince."
  flavour_khasa.341.t:0 "The Crown of Deshak"
  flavour_khasa.341.d:0 "“It seems that while many of the dukes voted in favour of staying with the usurper, many others amongst the nobility still recall and honour the vows they once swore to my grandfather and the adoration they had for him. Let the traitors know that while I do not carry the name of Stormbreaker I am of my mother’s line, and the blood of Daviros still runs strong in my veins.\n\n“The king of Eborthíl, however, has not taken kindly to the loyalty many of my people have shown me, and now he dares to denounce them as traitors. The dragon prepares to cross the straits once more, aiming to put my people under a leash again, angered by the loss of ‘his’ kingdom. I will not permit that, for today the sea-wyrm shall find its match, may Akasik watch over us…"
  flavour_khasa.341.a:0 "And may the storm winds blow ever in our favour.”"
  flavour_khasa.540.t:0 "An Offer of Revival"
  flavour_khasa.540.d:0 "Rejoice! For Khasa rises once more, we thought all was lost and we received many of our brothers and sisters from across the sea with open arms when the gnolls came over the waves and sands to take those we loved. Now the last scion of the Kekhasa dynasty has reclaimed his title as the rightful king of the Khasani and has approached us with an intriguing offer.\n\nWhile the síl Tretun may no longer rule over us we remember their deeds fondly. Tales of their founder Nahil, a Khasani by birth, and his wise rule are still told all over Tretun and under his dynasty Tretun endured against all odds for centuries.\n\nMindful of their cherished place in our history, the King of Khasa now offers us a return of Tretun to its former glory, if only we accept him or one of his family as king. Should we accept this bold proposal, we are assured of equality and autonomy under the rule of the Kekhasa. Yet many are wary of intertwining our fates so closely and prefer to elevate one of our own as duke and remain as stalwart allies, but nothing more, of our friends across the sea."
  flavour_khasa.540.a:0 "All hail Bashal, king of Akasik and Tretun!"
  flavour_khasa.540.b:0 "While his intentions are appreciated, a bittersweet no is all we can offer."
  flavour_khasa.541.t:0 "Rebirth of Tretun"
  flavour_khasa.541.d:0 "“Our shared history with the Tretunics goes back for millennia, when we were both little more than tribes struggling for survival and the first brave souls dared to cross the vast waters of the Divenhal. Ever since those times we have been proud to call each other family. And in recognition of our age-old bonds I am pleased to offer them once more the chance to rise anew, by uniting both our realms by blood, as they once were many generations ago.\n\n“There are no hidden motives to our offer, for we only wish the best for our brethren, as they do in turn, moved by our bonds of kinship.\n\n“It is certain that those realms surrounding them and laying claim to hold overlordship over them will try to sever our bond once more and seek to tear us apart, for none have forgotten the might of our alliance when both our realms were at their zenith.”"
