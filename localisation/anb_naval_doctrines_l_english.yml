 braving_north:0 "Braving the North"
 braving_north_desc:0 "The northern seas are treacherous. For centuries monsters, reavers, and various other terrors have prowled the waters of the Giant’s Grave and shores of the Reach, and yet coin has to be made, goods have to be moved. As such, we put our focus on formidable merchant vessels, ensuring they have the firepower to fend off those who would seek the wares they carry."
 munasi_statute:0 "Munasi Statute"
 munasi_statute_desc:0 "It was neither the quality of its wood, nor the zeal of its sailors that ensured the Damerian Republic dominated the Divenhal. The republic understood that it was good leadership that brought victory. And so do we. Taking inspiration from the late republic, we passed the Munasi Statute, guaranteeing that our fleets will always have the superior leadership they deserve."
 legacy_of_ice:0 "Legacy of Ice"
 legacy_of_ice_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the Era of Black Ice saw the Gerudians dominate the seas of Cannor and beyond. Their navies were specialized in hitting fast and retreating before the enemy was able to respond. And while the practice of raiding is frowned upon nowadays, the Gerudians still favor speed. With many of their people living on the coast being skilled sailors, the Gerudians have nimble fleets able to replenish any losses quickly."
 dominion_over_the_seas:0 "Dominion Over the Seas"
 dominion_over_the_seas_desc:0 "Victory is achieved by controlling the engagement. Controlling the engagement is achieved by overwhelming force. A large navy allows us to overwhelm our enemies and to disengage individual ships safely without compromising the battle line. We proved this again and again, whether in the Divenhal and Dameshead Sea, along the coasts of Aelantir or in the distant Gulf of Rahen."
 glorious_engagement:0 "Glorious Engagement"
 glorious_engagement_desc:0 "This distinctly Vernman doctrine emphasises rapid boarding tactics and shock and awe to produce quick, decisive victories. Naval warfare is treated not as a slow manoeuvring process of attrition, but an opportunity for glory no less real than battle on land."
 lions_fleet:0 "Lions Fleet"
 lions_fleet_desc:0 "Our time under Kheterata, Dameria and the Phoenix Empire may be a distant memory for most, but not for our navy. We took the best that their naval traditions had to offer and discarded the rest. As a result, our fleets of galleys are poised to dominate the East Divenhal."
 
 # SARHAL
 silver_admirals_akasi:0 "Silver Admirals"
 silver_admirals_akasi_desc:0 "For every child of Akasik, the sea and our father’s boons are second only to our Mother’s. His storms and riptides may scare most, but it is in the middle of the maelstrom where we find our strength. Let the meek cower before his gifts in fear and ignorance, for we know how to harness them."
 silver_admirals_mandate:0 "Silver Admirals"
 silver_admirals_mandate_desc:0 "In the times of Sedoric the Akasi were given the responsibility to act as Kheterata’s naval arm, the emperor recognising their skills as sailors and their powerful domain over the storms and waves. Let us return to their post as admirals of the sorrow."
 silver_admirals_konolkhatep:0 "Silver Admirals"
 silver_admirals_konolkhatep_desc:0 "The sailing expertise of the peoples of Akasik, human and gnoll alike, should not be underestimated. Now that we have swept away both the demonic invaders and the ruinous human kingdoms, their talents are in service to the most benevolent and merciful Steward of the Sorrow. Konolkhatep’s dominion over the seas will grow even more secure once we incorporate these skills into our admiralty corps."
 legacy_of_the_migration:0 "Legacy of the Migration"
 legacy_of_the_migration_desc:0 "A millennium ago the Vyzemby were pushed out of their ancestral land in what is now the Dao Nako jungles and Horashesh. To help facilitate these migrations, great and oversized skiffs were created to house as many as possible. While these displacements happened many centuries ago, some of the lessons learned from that time are still maintained. The grand transports that once held great numbers of refugees are still built, now holding all manner of supplies for maintaining a navy."
 narazjar:0 "Narazjar"
 narazjar_desc:0 "For all who inhabit the swampy jungles of Taneyas, naval warfare is just as common as land warfare. As such, Lizardfolk warriors are trained to excel at both naval and land combat; some Lizardfolk have even acquired mutations over time to make this change of style almost imperceptible, able to retract and extend webbed membranes at will to aid buoyancy and swimming speed."
 shackle_ships:0 "Shackle Ships"
 shackle_ships_desc:0 "For the various upstanding nations of the Gulf, piracy is a perennial threat that has only worsened over the years. In order to defend their slave ships from poachers and would-be liberators, a new doctrine developed across most of the Gulf; massive convoys dot the immense pristine waters in a defensive formation with the slave ships and their precious cargo huddled in the middle."
 raptors_of_the_gulf:0 "Raptors of the Gulf"
 raptors_of_the_gulf_desc:0 "The gulf of Rahen is a place of both prosperity and conflict, and for those enterprising states that seek to make their fortune by taking advantage of the chainers, it is vital to be as a bird of prey when engaging their foes. Swift, precise and deadly, a single misstep or blunder may result in the demise of the entire fleet."
 bulwar_kamelyan_tactics:0 "Kamelyan Tactics"
 bulwar_kamelyan_tactics_desc:0 "Named after the Bahari admiral, and queen of Deškumar, Kamelya Dartaxiara. Belonging to the first generation of post-Ashen Skies Bulwari magi, Kamelya put a great emphasis on the role of magic, designing battle plans that combined ships, magi, and flying platforms. While these tactics have been perfected by the Bulwari in the centuries since her death, she is still held in great regard as the Lioness of the Sea, one of the greatest admirals in Bulwari naval history."

 #AELANTIR
 kheionai_degarikes_rhatoposi:0 "Degárikes Rhatóposi"
 kheionai_degarikes_rhatoposi_desc:0 "The reintroduction of Degárikes into our navy has been a great boon to our naval might; as a result, many of our navy officers have proposed increasing our focus on the production and advancement of these titanic ships. Called the Rhatóposi or ‘Waterfall’ Doctrine, this will no doubt harm the quality and size of the rest of our fleet. Yet such titanic ships, in a number never before seen, will render questions of quantity somewhat moot."
