 toarnaire_wineries_title:0 "The Wineries"
 toarnaire_wineries_desc:0 "Not all were happy when we joined the Empire. The new Magisterial oversight, oppressive to many, forced the Roilsardi Blood Mages out of their work under threat of death or imprisonment. In Toarnaire, the mages chose to go into hiding instead, preferring to rather preserve their ancient tradition than to let it die to a foreign diktat.\n\nOrganized into the “Fifth Family”, an underground mage organisation, they practice their craft out of sight in secret laboratories under the many wineries of the city, perfectly placed to sell their wares in the shops above. Outside of closed circles of city-elite, little is known about this Fifth Family. Who knows how many skeletons they have hidden in casks and beyond illusory walls?"
 toarnaire_bloody_rebirth_title:0 "Bloody Rebirth"
 toarnaire_bloody_rebirth_desc:0 "As the dust of the Lilac Wars and the Greentide settled, a strange phenomenon emerge. People started to look to the past, to empires long since fallen, hoping to escape the misery of today. In many cities, a rebirth of art, science, philosophy and of course magic bloomed, inspired by the marvels of Castanor and Old Dameria. In the council of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and the cellars of the Fifth Family, many desire to bring this Renaissance to Toarnaire, so that ancient traditions can contribute to the city’s prestige."
 toarnaire_mageblood_title:0 "Mageblood"
 toarnaire_mageblood_desc:0 "Damestear is a powerful substance, magic given physical form. But how does one procure it without bringing attention to oneself? Trade of such rare and powerful resources is controlled, and what makes its way to the black markets is beyond expensive.\n\nThe solution of the Fifth Family? Mages’ blood. Called Blueblood, it is a substance with similar properties to Damestear, though weaker and more importantly easier to hide in the acquisition. Many of the laboratories of the Fifth prepare themselves to produce this “blue gold” so they may use it for their spells and potions."
 toarnaire_hidden_secrets_title:0 "Hidden Secrets"
 toarnaire_hidden_secrets_desc:0 "The sìl Vivin are known for their adventuring spirit. They have explored the four corners of Cannor and beyond and  brought back entire collections of artefacts and esoteric items. Their most controversial possessions were hidden in the secret archives of their ancestral home, the Tedertoar, to prevent them falling into Magisterial hands. Now that this estate is part of our country, the Fifth Family requests access to their secrets."
 toarnaire_red_street_title:0 "The Street Runs Red"
 toarnaire_red_street_desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] should have seen it coming…"
 toarnaire_gather_the_league_title:0 "Gather the League"
 toarnaire_gather_the_league_desc:0 "Our time in the Empire was greatly beneficial to us. Vincen separated us from the duchy of Roilsard and Adenn allowed us to join the League of Winebay, saving us from the destruction of the Fourth Lilac War. For Toarnaire, every piece fell into the right place.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the nobles of Roilsard. Lorent’s victory saw the end of the duchy and the counts scrambled to save what they could. The síl Saloren still claim ownership of our city but with the League protecting us, they are unlikely to ever act on it. Still, the situation presents an opportunity; it only requires the piece to fall in the right place again. Or, as we learned to do in the last forty years, for us to nudge them into the right place…"
 toarnaire_thorns_must_stand_title:0 "Stand as One"
 toarnaire_thorns_must_stand_desc:0 "The story is always the same. United, the Roilsardi are able to stand tall against the likes of Lorent. Yet when unity is the most needed, the nobles prefer to bicker between themselves. As we conquered Saloren and Loopuis, we remembered this truth. And now we must stand together, lest we suffer the same as the duchy of Roilsard -even if it means standing with those who destroyed it."
 toarnaire_tasteful_gift_title:0 "A Tasteful Gift"
 toarnaire_tasteful_gift_desc:0 "What a profitable affair our collaboration with Wineport has been. Let us send our dear friend [A16.Monarch.GetName] a bottle of our finest wine, made in the most renowned winery of Toarnaire."
 toarnaire_old_capital_title:0 "The Old Capital"
 toarnaire_old_capital_desc:0 "Not only did we challenge the Rose and win, we managed to recover Roilsard. More than just a victory for the armies of Toarnaire, it is a victory for all Roilsardi. Our namesake, the heart of the old duchy is back to its rightful owner once more. It suffered from the Lilac Wars and the Lorentish occupation, but now it can be restored to its true glory and its resources, alongside the síl Roilsard penchant for administration, are now available to us. Let's make good use of both."
 
 # Events
 flavor_toarnaire.1.t:0 "Secrets of the Black Keep"
 flavor_toarnaire.1.d:0 "Convincing the síl Vivin was not an easy task, but the Fifth Family now has access to their hidden archives and the wealth of knowledge locked within. They exacted their price, of course, but it was nothing we weren’t ready to pay so that our mages could continue their research."
 flavor_toarnaire.1.a:0 "We will see what the Fifth Family can come up with."
 flavor_toarnaire.2.t:0 "The City of Envy"
 flavor_toarnaire.2.d:0 "“If Anbenncóst is the World’s Desire, Toarnaire is the envy of Lencenor.”\n\nIt is a prideful boast, a statement that even the likes of Wineport and Lorentainé pale in comparison to Toarnaire. But to those that live within its wall, it is also a warning, a reminder to always watch one’s back, for envy drives the city. You can rise one day to the highest office in the city only to wake the next and see that someone has taken your place. If you are not careful, any gain can be lost, any fame can be torn to shreds, and the higher you rise, the harder you will fall. Everyone knows it. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] seems to have forgotten this.\n\nHe left work in the evening, intent on celebrating [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent success in the Red Flower Street, but never came home. He was found the next day, impaled in the middle of the causeway, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blood watering the cobbles.\nWhat happened is an open secret - [Root.Monarch.GetName] had outlived [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] usefulness - And now the five families have taken his place.\nThe event did not create much waves, for in a way, it was expected. Truly, Toarnaire is…"

 flavor_toarnaire.2.b:0 "…a Canturian City."
 flavor_toarnaire.3.t:0 "A Taste of Blood"
 flavor_toarnaire.3.d:0 "[A16.Monarch.GetName] has been found dead in [A16.Monarch.GetHerHis] home. The sight is horrifying, bloodshot-eyes and carmine trails leaking from every orifice. There is no doubt - [A16.Monarch.GetSheHe] was assassinated, [A16.Monarch.GetHerHis] wine filled with poison. Without its leader, the League will surely descend into chaos and only [Root.Monarch.GetName] can prevent it… even if many will disagree with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] actions."
 flavor_toarnaire.3.a:0 "Seize power, now!"
 toarnaire_city.1.t:0 "Our Greatest Sin"
 toarnaire_city.1.d:0 "Anbenncóst looks at us and does not see a rival. To the Queen of Cities, Toarnaire is nothing but a child looking with envious eyes at its magnificence. It is true, we envy its position in the world - but to underestimate us is a grave mistake."
 toarnaire_city.1.e:0 "It will only make our victory sweeter."
 toarnaire_city.2.t:0 "Minorities Gather in Toarnaire"
 toarnaire_city.2.d:0 "It has always been a common sight. Elves waiting on the docks for a family member, a distant cousin perhaps, to land. Ever since the Landing, Toarnaire is home to an elven community, living mainly in the northern districts. What is new is the arrival of small folks, halflings, dwarves and gnomes, to our city. Not having ties in the city, most end up in the ever expanding Brimdunaire on the southern side of the river. They do not struggle to find jobs in the city, using every advantage their species offer, particularly against humains. The main industry of the city, the wineries, is greatly interested by the skills they can bring, the Halflings found opening as tester or in the vineyards while Dwarves glassblower make fortunes with commands of bottles, and even the gnomes found their place, their great mind put into service in the underground laboratories. As the city of Toarnaire grows, more and more come, to the point that we should decide what our official policy is toward them."
 toarnaire_city.2.a:0 "Encourage this! Toarnaire shall rival Anbenncóst!"
 toarnaire_city.2.b:0 "Allow this. More subjects are always welcome."
 toarnaire_city.2.c:0 "Drive them away! Toarnaire is for our kind only!"
 toarnaire_city.3.t:0 "Toarnaire Prospers"
 toarnaire_city.3.d:0 "The city of Toarnaire has continued to prosper and grow. The Thorndocks have long since surpassed any other naval district in the Bay of Wine. The Víoraine, the city center, is a marvel of Lencori and Damerian Renaissance-style buildings with elven touches, while the rose roofs of the Rialaire Rosé extend to the vineyards at the edge of the city. South of the river, the Brimdunaire sprawls, a patchwork of every architectural style of the last two centuries. Toarnaire has now become one of the most developed cities in Cannor. We can take advantage of the momentum and see the city rise ever-higher."
 toarnaire_city.3.a:0 "Push further, the city's splendor is still matched by others!"
 toarnaire_city.3.b:0 "A job well done already!"
 toarnaire_city.4.t:0 "Toarnaire Triumphant"
 toarnaire_city.4.d:0 "In recent days, Toarnaire has become more wealthy and prosperous than even the legendary city of Anbenncóst. The Rosé and the Víoraine have expanded in a somewhat controlled way, long since coiling over the northern hills and their vineyards, which now seem as much a part of the city as the manors and theaters of Toarnaire’s richest district. The Thorndocks now buffer both sides of the city, so many ships visiting to feed its warehouse and burgeoning industry that it is often hard for visitors to see where the sea ends and the city begins.\n\nThe most striking transformation has happened in the Brimdunaire District, however; what was once considered a slum has completely transformed, as many powerful merchants and guilds rise from its streets. They have financed magnificent galleries, places both to sell their wares and compete with the elites of the north in prestige. The Brimdunaire is a place of constant changes, of movements, a patchwork of narrow streets and dense apartments.In all this growth, only one constant - the Red Flower Street becomes more and more an iconic symbol of Toarnaire, instead of the infamous place it was known as.\n\nToarnaire has also expanded underground: cisterns, catacombs, caves and underground production areas have joined the laboratories of the wineries, both legal and illegal. A network of tunnels and hidden passages connect them, forming a labyrinthine undercity where life is as common as the surface."
