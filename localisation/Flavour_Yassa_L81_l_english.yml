 yassa_old_trade_partners_title:0 "Old Trade Partners"
 yassa_old_trade_partners_desc:0 "They were the first. When no one else among these scaleless creatures would accept us, decried us as monstrous, the halflings were the first to greet us as equals. We welcomed them in turn, allowing them to trade freely in our lands. While this relationship has been fruitful so far, opportunities always exist to deepen it. We have heard from some traders that the halflings require adventurers. We have able-bodied lizards eager to prove themselves. Perhaps something can be arranged..."

 yassa_a_growing_port_title:0 "A Growing Port"
 yassa_a_growing_port_desc:0 "For as long as we can remember, the only ones who had frequented our ports were the halflings and other lizardfolk. As we've begun to build relationships across Sarhal, however, this has started to change. While we've certainly been seeing more new faces lately, they have not been limited to originating from the usual suspects. Humans especially have begun to give us consideration, where once they decried us as monsters fit only for slaying. This change can only mean good things for us."

 yassa_the_shifting_trade_title:0 "The Shifting Trade"
 yassa_the_shifting_trade_desc:0 "The humans of Tanizu and Dakinshi are not strangers to the lizardfolk. Indeed, our kind has been accepted in these lands for quite some time now. However, trade between us has thus far only ever been conducted across the land, which has obviously been slower and unreliable. Thanks to our inroads in other areas, however, we may well be the first lizardfolk to open up a sea trade route with these areas. Perhaps from this, we can expand even further..."

 yassa_flourshing_trade_title:0 "Flourshing Trade"
 yassa_flourshing_trade_desc:0 "The Mengi were once ruled by a dragon. As contemptible as this is, we've learned better than to voice those opinions aloud. Besides, it seems their dragon overlord is no more. Furthermore, their lands are rich and provide ample opportunities for our merchants. We should attempt to build relations with the Mengi, so that we might continue to spread the reach of our trade."

 yassa_pirate_relation_title:0 "Pirate Relations"
 yassa_pirate_relation_desc:0 "As we have inched further and further north, our new trading partners have warned us to keep from the Gulf of Rahen, lest we be beset by pirates. At first, we thought their stories sensationalized, or perhaps formed from a lack of experience with dealing with such outlaws. Unfortunately, we have since learned their warnings to be well founded. The pirates of the Gulf are not only real, but they have proven impossible even for us to fully navigate around. Perhaps the Council will have ideas on how to deal with this new problem..."

 yassa_impress_the_raj_title:0 "Impress The Raj"
 yassa_impress_the_raj_desc:0 "From the Mengi, we have begun to learn of the lands that lie beyond the pirate-infested seas. We have even seen merchants from this so-called Rahen at times. Sometimes they are human, others they appear to be strange feline people. Yet always they are dressed in resplendent robes, completely unlike anything we've ever seen on anyone else. If their mode of dress is any indication of the wealth of their homeland, we must make contact at once and begin to trade."

 yassa_spiral_across_the_sea_title:0 "Spire Across the Sea"
 yassa_spiral_across_the_sea_desc:0 "The so-called Sea Spire has always taunted us. It is visible from just across the horizon, and yet it remains tantalizingly out of our reach. It springs forth from the ocean itself, yet lies closest to Baashidi lands. That seems to convince them it is "theirs," even though their true origins are known perfectly well to us. We must find a way to correct this issue. Perhaps we could even make some friends along the way?"

 yassa_one_lucky_gambit_title:0 "One Lucky Gambit"
 yassa_one_lucky_gambit_desc:0 "The Baashidi have long refused to take our hands, no matter how often we extend them. Who among us can forget when King Kiusz's delegation was attacked the moment they entered the city of their hosts? How many lizards have been lost to attempts at straightforward diplomacy? Some on the Council whisper of an alternative. If the humans will not accept friendship in the conventional way, then perhaps we need a bit of... Unorthodox persuasion."

 yassa_a_spire_long_fallen_title:0 "A Spire Long Fallen"
 yassa_a_spire_long_fallen_desc:0 "With our recent successes in dealing with the Baashidi, we have been able to confirm for the naysayers that the Sea Spire is no mere mirage or mass delusion. It is a real structure, and one which we can potentially visit. While this will require cooperation with the local humans to make the endeavor fully effective, we anticipate the discoveries we could make will more than make up for any costs. Aside from that, making inroads with the humans is always good."

 yassa_our_legacy_title:0 "Our Legacy"
 yassa_our_legacy_desc:0 "The 330th Empire has come and gone, but its legacy remains. From exploring the Sea Spire, we have learned there is yet more to discover about them, however. The answers lie in Nazhni, and we must ensure the city is fully under our control before we can ever hope to uncover them all. We must leave no stone unturned, for certainly what we discover will be well worth the effort we've put into learning it."

 yassa_old_and_new_ports_title:0 "Old And New Ports"
 yassa_old_and_new_ports_desc:0 "As we expand our mercantile influence, our ports become ever more important. From them our merchants venture forth, and to them foreign merchants venture. If we are to ensure we can meet the ever-increasing demands this movement of merchants comes with, we must work to expand our infrastructure. Merchants must not only be able to dock and undock quickly, but they must experience as few difficulties in trading in our lands as possible. They are the lifeblood of our realm, and their needs must not be ignored."

 yassa_seabound_roads_title:0 "Seabound Roads"
 yassa_seabound_roads_desc:0 "With commerce becoming so crucial to our realm's function, our ports have become very popular destinations indeed. There are of course the merchants who traverse in and out at any given time, but there are also others who see the ports as the perfect places to buy and sell things, be they products, resources, or even services. Such is the widespread interest that it even draws in lizards from the interior. Just as the sea conveys our merchants, so too must our subjects be conveyed across land. A network of roads would be perfect for this purpose."

 yassa_human_training_officers_title:0 "Baashidi Officers"
 yassa_human_training_officers_desc:0 "Our new Baashidi friends have taught us much. Among the more interesting things they've shown us is how to make proper use of gunpowder. This simple powder, when properly applied with a specially made weapon, can thunder out death at a distance far more spectacularly than any simple bow or arrow could. Some among our military staff even believe this might be just the weapon we need to take the fight to the Ashhana..."

 yassa_sponsor_ashhana_festivals_title:0 "Ashhana Festivals"
 yassa_sponsor_ashhana_festivals_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of the Council, we have learned how to lift the curse that lingers over the Ashhana. But this knowledge is only half the battle. Unfortunately, we must continue to fight these poor lizardfolk, and bring them to heel. But once they are under our influence, we will not simply leave them to fester or die. No, we shall bring the cure to them- grand art festivals shall be organized in their settlements, and artists shall be hired from far and wide to create beautiful works for them. Once the curse fades, they will surely be grateful for our efforts."

 yassa_the_reclamation_title:0 "The Reclamation"
 yassa_the_reclamation_desc:0 "In the past, the jungles of Taneyas were as integral to the lizard empires as any other area. Yet with the affliction faced by the Ashhana, this region had seemingly become lost to us. Some believed the Ashhana would never truly be part of the 333rd Empire, or were otherwise incapable of it. We have proven all such notions wrong by lifting their curse, and proving they are just as capable of rationality and civility as the rest of us. Now, with their help, we can begin to bring the wayward back home."

 yassa_taming_the_jungle_title:0 "Taming The Jungle"
 yassa_taming_the_jungle_desc:0 "The Ashhana have been redeemed, but that does not mean our work is done yet. In their cursed stupor, they have unfortunately neglected much of what is necessary for civilized living. Fortunately, they continue to have us to assist them. We shall help them build the infrastructure needed to settle down and live good, decent lives. They shall not simply know peace of mind, but peace of living as well. They shall know civilization, in all its glory."

 yassa_a_jungle_tamed_title:0 "A Jungle Tamed"
 yassa_a_jungle_tamed_desc:0 "Finally, the Ashhana are civilized. They not only have the minds for it, but the cities as well. We have built a strong relationship with the Ashhana, and some on the Council seem convinced that the Ashhana would make excellent bodyguards for the King. Not only do they demonstrate great strength, but their gratitude for our efforts has also translated into great loyalty. What more could we ask for in royal bodyguards?"

 yassa_a_lizard_in_all_ports_title:0 "A Lizard In All Ports"
 yassa_a_lizard_in_all_ports_desc:0 "Our merchants have spread far and wide. Not a deal can go by in Sarhal or Rahen without a lizardfolk merchant being party to it, and their role is most certainly respected among their peers. More than that, however, we are respected. Where once the humans and others saw us as mere beasts or vermin, we have managed to show them that our kind is anything but. No longer are we targets for their would-be heroes to slay, but instead are rational actors for their merchants and diplomats to deal with like civilized folks. That doesn't mean some don't still revile us, or that war will never come. But when war does come, we ought to be able to count on some of our new friends for help."

 yassa_one_more_wall_title:0 "One More Wall"
 yassa_one_more_wall_desc:0 "The Ashhana are relentless. Not a day seems to go by without news of some sort of raid or mounting attack reaching our ears. Just recently, one of our great fortifications was utterly laid to waste by them. If we are to survive the next full assault, we must rebuild. Not simply the fortifications, but the lives of our people as well. We must continue on with life, regardless of what these savages throw at us. Yet still we wonder if things must always be this way..."

 yassa_reward_the_council_title:0 "Reward The Council"
 yassa_reward_the_council_desc:0 "Despite their reputation, the so-called Council of Fools has proven itself remarkably useful as of late. While their ideas often seem absurd on their face, there are some diamonds in the rough worth cultivating and using. From those diamonds, we have made much progress in a short time. We now know how to help rehabilitate the Ashhana, and we have begun spreading our merchants to places they could have only dreamed of treading once before. Building them a more grand meeting place will not only signal our appreciation, but also perhaps encourage further attendance to Council meetings, diversifying the pool of ideas."

 yassa_the_ashhanas_hand_title:0 "The Ashhana's Hand"
 yassa_the_ashhanas_hand_desc:0 "Our efforts to help the Ashhana have had interesting consequences, both for themselves and our realm. Unsurprisingly, many of them have taken a keen interest in the arts, with quite a few of their artists earning renown even outside our borders. Similarly, our efforts to build up their lands have seen many Ashhana take to the construction sector, which has translated to benefits for the rest of our realm. Their contributions to Yassa have been impressive. Perhaps they are worthy of a place at the Council."

 yassa_officialize_the_council_title:0 "Officialize The Council"
 yassa_officialize_the_council_desc:0 "The Council has come far from its original incarnation, and has come a long way in shedding its poor reputation. Every segment of Yassa society is represented among the Council, with even the venerable Naga recently showing interest. We should elevate the Council into a full branch of our government to maximize the benefits gained from it."

 yassa_merchants_join_council_title:0 "Merchants Join Council"
 yassa_merchants_join_council_desc:0 "As our trade reach has expanded, many merchants have of course sent off their sons to head their enterprises in wayward merchant communities. The work is both profitable and honorable, and few would think anything of it. Yet for some, a new destination has sprung up- one very close to home, indeed. Some merchants have petitioned for their sons to be granted places on the Council, and not simply to dispose of the sons they're embarrassed to have around either. No, these lizards will come to speak to the ideas and interests of the merchant class. We have no doubt they'll bring novel ideas, as well."

 yassa_gain_the_peoples_trust_title:0 "Gain The People's Trust"
 yassa_gain_the_peoples_trust_desc:0 "Despite their recent successes, many people still decry the Council as a Council of Fools. This not only discourages engagement with the Council, but reflects poorly on us for investing them with so much influence. This must change. We will show them how truly effective the Council can be, and at long last put to bed the notion that we are perpetuating the greatest mistake in lizardfolk history."

These entrepreneurs chatter amongst themselves about where to next establish a new merchant outpost for $COUNTRY$, improving our standing and bringing back untold wealth.\n\nThere are many ports our traders can travel to, but our state can only concentrate on one at a time.

 flavour_yassa.3.desc:0 "Fahvanosy, or the Summer Isles, is a land dominated by the Vyzemby Halflings, a people we have known for centuries by way of the close ties between our two lands. Awe-inspiring ports like Teramzadai already teem with lizardfolk communities—a testament to the longstanding connection between our two peoples. Many lizardfolk come here for their first journey beyond Taneyas, drawn by the deep roots and the commercial bounty that halfling ports bring, as well as the adventuring opportunities not available back home.\n\nEstablishing a new merchant community here would serve to deepen our existing ties, bring yet more riches, and tie our legacy inexorably closer to the halfling people. With many chiefs, mayors, and kings on the island already receptive to lizardfolk business, we shall surely benefit from yet another outpost on the Summer Isles."

 flavour_yassa.4.desc:0 "To the south, the Odu Kherass Mountains run impressively far and high, stretching beyond the horizon. This land, known as Jasiir Jadid, is home to a curious group of humans: the Baashidi. Committed to plutocracy in a way few other realms are, the kings of these lands are incredibly receptive to mercantile endeavors. They express a dogged commitment to unraveling the secrets and truth of existence, their faith bound to such a task in ways seldom seen elsewhere. We have found an inroad with them by way of the island of Uwakila Baashi, an urbanized republic that sits at a unique position within Baashidi politics. Their connections to us, the rest of the Baashidi, and the merfolk under the waves serve them incredibly well as  diplomatic intermediaries. Uwakila Baashi's open-mindedness allows us to establish merchant communities among the rest of Jasiir Jadid, using their good reputation to endorse our own endeavors.\n\nAside from some persuasion through our acquaintances, the Baashidi’s enterprising ports will undoubtedly serve to further our burgeoning network of outposts."

 flavour_yassa.5.t:0 "Ishyamtumu & Bamaliwuni"
 flavour_yassa.5.desc:0 "The Inyaswarosa are a people defined almost entirely by their faith. Whether it is the tribal Tanizu confederacies of Ishyamtumu or the settled Dakinshi warlords of Bamaliwuni, their reverence for the natural order and mighty beasts sets them apart from their other human neighbors, enabling them to shift between human and animal form; Even some lizardfolk, the Cyazizeta, have come to adopt their ways of life! Such piety allows them to perform impressive feats by way of these shapeshifting abilities, earning a unique reputation among the myriad of human societies we have come into contact with.\n\nThe realms these humans and lizardfolk rule may not be as rich or prosperous as some of their neighbors, but they are home to resources and riches that are seldom seen elsewhere; Convincing these warlords and tribal chieftains to allow our merchants to settle their coasts will not only provide us with a valuable commercial outpost but also develop a bond the local realm can use to further their own prosperity, elevating the lands of Ishyamtumu and Bamaliwuni to new heights."

Great cities such as Yetmesira and Dakmender draw people from all walks of life across Halann. Many of them have established significant outposts of their own here, eager to obtain even a sliver of the wealth that flows from Madriamilak. Our own merchants are eager to stake their claim in a land so rich with commerce, asking us to name a port they can direct their efforts to."

 flavour_yassa.7.desc:0 "Much of Haless is home to settled kingdoms and principalities, their grand cities with thousands of years of history and trade that rivals anywhere on Halann, but the Lupulan Rainforest is one of the major exceptions. This massive peninsula is covered in a jungle so dense it reminds many of our merchants of home, and the many Yanglam tribes here even revere a spirit that takes the shape of a lizard! While these chieftains may hesitate allowing our merchants to build communities on their coasts, we can surely show them the riches our presence has to offer.\n\The major exception to this endeavor, however, is the Kingdom of Arawkelin: a different, more mercantile realm whose interests align with ours in more ways than one. Though diametrically opposed to the native Yanglam tribes, their resplendent city at the mouth of the Sunharbour river and their commitment to fostering commerce between Rahen and Yanshen makes them ideal candidates to sponsor a new community of lizardfolk.\n\nRegardless of our choice in local diplomacy, a merchant outpost in the Lupulan Rainforest would further connect our growing network in Sarhal to the unimaginably vast riches that flow across Haless."

 flavour_yassa.8.desc:0 "Of the regions our merchant ships have traveled to, none are quite as resplendantly rich as the lands of Rahen. Human and harimari rulers have built and reigned over cities, kingdoms, and empires that may very well compare to Taneyas’ previous heights of history and prosperity. The merchant kingdoms along the Raheni Coast control trade spanning the Gulf of Rahen to Madriamilak, with the immeasurably vast Kharunyana River giving life to the land in a way few other rivers truly can. Along the great banks of the Kharunyana are cities that rival entire realms in commerce, enjoying thousands of boats a day that sail up and down the continent-spanning river.\n\nHere, our merchants stand at a unique position within the existing Raheni society. Operating outside the High Philosophy’s rigid doctrines, they skirt many rules tailored for the castes in ways that keep kings in power and their subjects servile.\n\nDespite this, Rahen is a land that breathes commerce unlike any other. A lizardfolk enclave may very well add to the region’s already expansive tapestry, bringing untold boons to our growing network of outposts."

 #####Merchant Tales

 flavour_yassa.9.t:0 "Tales of Cay Cam Sinh"
 flavour_yassa.9.d:0 ""They call him the Ghost Emperor. I'd never seen him myself, of course, but everyone in that city talked about him as if he were as real as anyone else. I thought it was just a legend or some bit of local folklore, at first. Just a frightening tale used to make the young ones obey their elders. Maybe some folks use it for that... But there's much more to it. So much more.\n\n"They say the Ghost Emperor was once a normal man- well, except that he was the Emperor, obviously. They say that, as he grew old and close to death, he decided none of his sons could succeed him. Every teller gives you a different reason why, but the conclusion is the same. He orders them all to be killed, and decides that he's going to rule forever. No one ever said how he could just choose not to die like that, but his force of will seems like it had something to do with it.\n\n"If it only ended there, I'd still think this was just a story. But as it turns out, this was a real historical event. They even had a whole civil war over it. I never figured out who won, though. Does the Ghost Emperor still reign unopposed from his palace? Did the one son who survived his purge manage to defeat him and take his rightful throne? They still say the Ghost Emperor haunts the land, in any case. Makes my scales tingle just thinking about it."\n\n- Excerpt from Teran Goldscale's "Accounts of Halessi Ports""

 flavour_yassa.10.d:0 ""They always tell you that halflings love food, but you never really get it until you see one scarf down a whole day's worth of rations for one meal. Then again, I never knew if that was something they all did, or if Masana was just weird like that. It never bothered me too much, since he never made me carry his supplies or cut into my own meals. Can't say the same for that bastard Rakoto, but he didn't live long enough to cause me that much headache.\n\n"Anyway, we had been wandering around for half a day looking for some kind of beast that had been scaring the locals. It wasn't glamorous work, but it kept our bellies full and our senses keen. At least, it would have if we hadn't been wasting so much time on the damn thing. The Captain was just about ready to call it quits and tell those villagers to shove it, and I was keen to join her on that.\n\n"Then that thing came screaming out of the jungle. It moved so fast, I can hardly even remember seeing all of it at once. It was definitely some kind of monster, though, and matched the descriptions we had been given. We made short work of it, which you'd think would have given me a chance to get a closer look. But no, turns out the halflings realized pretty quickly that the thing was edible. Next thing you know, they're tearing off chunks of meat and starting fires to have a little picnic. Captain managed to save the head so we had proof of our kill, at least. I'd hate to see if they'd have tried eating its eyes, or any of those teeth..."\n\n- Excerpt from Zamr Dreamchaser's "Adventuring With the Smallfolk""

But you don't really understand just how much power money can give you until you see an Uwakilan banker at work.\n\n"Samatar learned that the hard way. I had made a few deals with him before, and he could drive a hard bargain, but it turned out he was in a lot of debt to an Uwakilan banker named Limaan. I never knew him well enough to know how he racked it all up, but it must have been a hell of a bind Limaan got him in. Samatar never seemed all that poor, especially for a merchant, and he was good at what he did. What sweet magic was Limaan working on him to get all those debts in his name?\n\n"Whatever Samatar got out of the whole deal, it seems like he lost it in the end. When Limaan got sick of not being paid, he greased a few palms to have all of Samatar's merchandise seized, and his ship impounded. I hear most of it was auctioned off to pay off Samatar's debts, though I'm sure Limaan knew how to do some favors, too. Ironically, they estimated the full value as outweighing what Samatar owed. Didn't mean he got any of it back, though. Come to think of it, I never did see or hear from him again..."\n\n- Excerpt from Kella Wavebreaker's "How I Learned to Love Interest Rates""

 flavour_yassa.12.d:0 ""I had thought the Citadel of Stories was impressive, when I first saw it. It still is, of course, but I'm not sure anything could compare to the Grand Library of Qasri Aqoon. Everything in the city seemed to revolve around it, and the splendor and size of it certainly matched that positioning. There didn't seem to be a subject I could think of that they didn't have several books dedicated to, and they seemed to come from all across the world.\n\n"But more remarkably, the library didn't exist solely on dry land. So I've heard, about half of the entire structure is entirely submerged in order to allow the merfolk access to its halls. So I've been told, those levels are far from empty of knowledge, either. As a matter of fact, the merfolk have magic capable of preserving and keeping dry anything they bring down there! Ironically, this has made the submerged portions of the library the ones with the most ancient and arcane knowledge, as their magic is able to keep books together from thousands of years ago.\n\n"Unfortunately, I wasn't granted access to the full breadth of the library's knowledge, but there was still so much I was able to learn from my visit. Perhaps if I'm able to earn the trust of the curators, I'll be able to learn more on my next visit..."\n\n- Excerpt from Mitra Wiseclaw's "What Humanity Has to Teach""

 flavour_yassa.13.d:0 ""I asked Vapyata what the true purpose of such accumulation of wealth was. Surely if his interest was spiritual fulfillment, then what good would material things be to him? He seemed to consider my question for a moment, before he asked one of his own. He asked me what my people and faith most valued, above all else. Of course, I explained the prophecy of the 333rd Empire to him. He nodded as if he understood, though I did not initially think the old harimari possibly could.\n\n"Then he asked me what I would devote to achieving the 333rd Empire. I was surprised, but answered honestly. I would give anything, do anything, if I could know it would make the prophecy come true. Could anyone reasonable among our kind say otherwise? He seemed to smile at my answer, and then went on to explain. I still remember his words clearly.\n\n"'That which you call spiritual fulfillment is, to us, just as important as this empire is to you. Wealth is a means to achieving that end, but it is just that- a means. Yes, we should always secure and expand our wealth when we can, but we must also be generous with it in order to promote good works. Just as you might accumulate to help achieve the 333rd Empire, I accumulate to help achieve Purtara.'\n\n"His answer made sense to me, and not simply in explaining his own beliefs. In truth, I had never considered just how deeply every aspect of our society goes toward fulfilling the prophecy. Yes, we know every one of us must submit to it, but to think that even the act of commerce could contribute to fulfilling it gave me a new sense of purpose. I thanked Vapyata for his insight, before returning to trading wares with him."\n\n- Excerpt from Irlak Dragonsbane's "Dialogues With the Silk Turban""

 flavour_yassa.14.d:0 ""I knew I would enjoy Prince Erel's company about as soon as I met him. Though clearly a proud and influential creature, he still took the time to compliment my trade ship's construction. He had evidently never seen anything quite like it, and I had to give some explanations for how we tend to design our ocean vessels. In his explanations to me in turn, it seemed there were some interesting differences between our methods- though also some striking similarities.\n\n"That could be the theme of my time with Prince Erel, truly. Though he held himself in a certain way that was entirely strange to me, we still found common ground in affairs of trade and sea travel. He even ventured to tell me that the elves from which he descended were once a nomadic seafaring people, after some great cataclysm devastated their homeland. I couldn't help but feel some sympathy in that regard.\n\n"He was very proud of his lineage, I could tell, and we discussed the matter for some time. I was curious, and it made for a solid foundation to build a rapport besides. By the end of our talk, I daresay we may have even become friends. At the very least, he agreed that there was mutual profit to be had with his people coming to visit our shores, and ours visiting his in turn.

No disrespect to humans, but they never struck me as beautiful, and sticking feathers onto one didn't really change that for me. On the second one though, he was so right.\n\n"I don't even know how to properly describe it. I've spoken to a lot of people, lizard and not, but nothing I had ever heard really compared before I heard that first harpy begin to sing. I didn't understand the words, but the effect wasn't lost on me. I could see why my new human friend was smitten with these creatures, and why he had insisted I come along to see them too.\n\n"After the performance, she started going around and chatting with the audience. Funny enough, she seemed more interested in me than Idris, even if they agreed to meet up later. But me, she asked a lot of questions. Where I came from, what it was like, how many others like me there were... Apparently she'd never seen a lizard before. It was good company, at least, and we traded some stories for a while.\n\n"She didn't ask to see me later like she did with Idris, which he seemed pretty confused about, but she did say she might have to come visit Yassa someday. She even said something about maybe opening a Songhall over here.

But the place I found most interesting, more than any other, was the ports. Here one could see ships come into and out of harbor, a sight that'd normally be mundane, were it not for the beauty of these ships.\n\n"Their edifices were made of a gorgeous white substance, often painted, always beautifully carved. It seemed to cause no trouble for sailing, either, as many sailors were able to attest upon my inquiry. I must confess that I asked a great many questions about these magnificent ships, to the point where some must have thought me strange or suspicious. Of course, I made no secret about my intentions, which allowed me to continue doing so without any significant obstacles. A bit of payment for time spent never hurt, either.\n\n"From those I spoke to, I learned this white material was something called ivory, apparently sourced from the tusks of local beasts. Given the luxurious nature of the material, and the dangers faced by oceangoing vessels, it would certainly take a highly skilled shipright to make something both elegant and functional out of it. Obviously such people existed, for many such ships caught my eye in my explorations. I even had the pleasure of getting the information of a couple, as well as a merchant who could supply ivory..."\n\n- Excerpt from Dashigy Greenstalker's "The Wonders of the Mengi""

It seemed to be populated with people of all sorts, from humans hailing from both Rahen and Sarhal, to the harimari, even to some lizardfolk. But one of the more interesting groups I came across were creatures they called orcs. These I had never even heard of, let alone seen, and my first encounter with one happened entirely by chance.\n\n"I had been browsing the wares of a few market stalls when I came across one guarded by a burly creature with brown skin. Were it not for his size and the tusks protruding from his mouth, I might have mistaken him for a human. Despite his somewhat intimidating aura, he was quite friendly when I spoke to him, indicating that his master was occupied elsewhere, but would return to show me his wares soon.\n\n"Deciding to wait for a time, and seeing that this guard was amenable to chatting, I asked a few questions. He told me his name was Orok, and that he was a slave to his master. I was surprised at how casually he expressed this, but learned through his explanation that slavery took on a unique character here. In fact, slaves apparently had some power and authority that was completely unknown to 'free' individuals. This, he said, was very different from his former masters.\n\n"I asked him who that might be, and he fell silent for a moment. I had thought I might have offended him, but he explained that it was simply a difficult topic. Still, he told me that he had once been a slave to something called the Command, where he was treated as nothing more than a disposable beast of war. Here, he said, his servitude at least earned him respect. I could only imagine how brutal this Command must have been for this orc to regard any form of slavery as preferable to what he endured there..."\n\n- Excerpt from Tralit Sunlover's "A Glimpse Into Rahen's Mysteries""

Beginning from a central tile, shaped in a hexagon, the rest of the settlement sprung forth, each in its own hexagonal space. Aside from proving quite elegant to look at, it also offered the interesting bonus of leaving very little space wasted.\n\n"My halfling host informed me that this was a modernization of his people's Anamoa design, one which had once proliferated across the coasts of western Sarhal. That more such places existed was almost as baffling as the idea that they weren't in common usage. Why both things could be true at once was strange to me, and I expressed this to my host. He seemed to agree, but could only express that more went into construction than simply having a good design.\n\n"I asked him specifically what resources he might need to replicate such a design, and he seemed to ponder the question for a moment before answering. He rattled off various amounts and dimensions, quantities and qualities of materials, and I must admit it even made my head swim a bit. Yet it all sounded doable, if certainly a task. I asked him if he would be willing to build one in Yassa, if he were given the proper resources to do so.\n\n"I've always struggled at reading the expressions of non-lizardfolk, but I think he smiled after I asked that. He agreed readily to my proposal, and said I need only direct him to the intended site for him to begin.

Riyiwedeb had mostly been an impressive city, with vast outputs of iron that could put our finest mines to shame, yet I soon realized that this output came at a cost. The iron was used for more than sale or weaponry, of course. They were also used to make the chains that kept their slaves in line. Somehow, my poor friend Sargin had ended up among them.\n\n"I believe he recognized me first, but said nothing until I addressed him. That fire in his eye I had known from our first meeting seemed to have dulled considerably. From the barking of his overseer, I could understand why. Fortunately, I could repay my friend at long last for saving my life all those years ago.\n\n"Amidst the shouts of the overseer, I asked pointedly if Sargin was for sale. Though it pained me to have to barter for his freedom in such a way, I knew there was no better option in this city of chains. After a bit of haggling, we exchanged coins and signed a bill of sale, thus making the transaction official.\n\n"I cannot imagine what was running through Sargin's head at the time. Relief? A sense of betrayal? Confusion? Regardless, I sought to ease his fears. Given the keys to his shackles, I promptly removed them and cast them aside. I promised him that he would be free, and remain free, even if that meant taking him back to Yassa with me.

 flavour_yassa.20.d:0 ""It's never been uncommon for me to discuss a trade deal over a couple of drinks, or even in a public place. There were quite a few things uncommon about this particular meeting, however. The first was the merchant's 'pet,' which he explained to be a Goldscale Kobold he kept around for good luck. The creature's draconic appearance unsettled me somewhat, but it seemed perfectly docile. In fact, I quickly learned that it was sapient, and the merchant regularly allowed it to contribute to our conversations.\n\n"My initial discomfort with the arrangement between the two shifted once the subject of the kobold's homeland came up. Off-handedly, it mentioned rumors of someone named Balris, and inquired if I knew anything about him. Humoring it, I told the truth- that the name meant nothing to me, but I could keep an eye out if I received more information. What the kobold proceeded to describe, in so many words, was a dragon, and that he had created its kind.\n\n"It took restraint to not lash out at that moment, and I quickly reminded myself of what this kobold was- a human's pet. What once disquieted me now made me feel triumphant. So proud was this little thing of its horrid master, yet it was forced into companionship with a human instead. Out of politeness to the merchant, I voiced none of this, of course.\n\n"Far less interesting, but still of note, was that the beverage we drank was something called coffee. Evidently it was something of a luxury, and I could immediately tell why. Fortunately, the merchant was very helpful in informing me of where more could be procured..."\n\n- Excerpt from Tsorak Stormbinder's "Strangers in Strange Lands""

 flavour_yassa.1.d:0 "Lizardfolk coming into Yassa would rarely be such a cause of interest. Commerce was as natural a part of life as most other professions, after all. Yet as you and numerous others crowd around to see the group currently arriving, it's clear that these are anything but your usual travelers. Of course, you had been given advance notice of their return, and had made sure the town watch wouldn't assume you were being invaded. Were it not for your regular interactions with the Council, you would never have dreamed such a thing would be necessary, of course.\n\nYou can already see evidence of what they've been up to since they left. Five years ago, these brave volunteers had set off to Teramzadai to offer their assistance as soldiers and adventurers. Today, they come back with the bounty of such hard work- weapons, gold, and assorted trinkets and knick-knacks. Curiously, you also notice some strangers in their midst. A bit of conversation confirms them to be lizardfolk from Fahavanosy.\n\nAs you later learn from reading the stories they write down for the Yassa Royal Library, many of these returnees grew fond of Fahavanosy, and have since returned there to form the heart of a new merchant community."

 flavour_yassa.21.t:0 "Gulf Of Rahen Pirates"
 flavour_yassa.21.d:0 "For some time, you had found yourself frustrated by news emerging from the merchant community. While they had successfully expanded their reach through Eastern Sarhal and Jasiir Jadid, attempts to piece into Haless were proving far more difficult. Aside from the usual issues that came with your kind being seen as monstrous by other races, further problems arose from the fact that the seas around Haless were awash with pirates.\n\nToday, the Council had drifted to the subject of just what to do about all of this, and you sat in with more attention than usual. Of course, many of the ideas are as idiotic or insane as you've come to expect. Two councilors almost even come to blows over their competing, equally implausible ideas. You fear this will become just another wasted day, until one suggestion pierces through the noise.\n\n"What if we were to simply pay off these pirates in exchange for their protection?" A few voices scoffed, but you see the merit in such a seemingly simple proposal. Pirates only truly cared about plunder and loot, didn't they? If you could offer them a better deal working with your merchants than against them, you could finally begin making inroads into Halessi trade."

 flavour_yassa.22.d:0 "You hadn't come to expect much from the so-called Council of Fools at this point. It almost seemed as if they were engaged in some esoteric contest to find new ideas that were more crazy and implausible than the last ones proposed. You couldn't help but wonder if this was some elaborate joke at your personal expense. That you still attended meetings was less out of any hope for something productive, and more to try and limit the chaos their insane ideas might cause if left unopposed.\n\nStill, the entire thing is mostly boring, and you find your mind wandering at times. At this moment, you think back to your father, and his failed attempts to improve relations with the Baashidi. You think of the great spire that stands off their coast, just barely visible to you from across the sea. You think of how important it was to the 330th Empire, and how meaningful it could be to reclaim.\n\n"A fake war!" Your internal musings are interrupted by a cry from a member of the Council. Already he's launched into an explanation of what he describes as 'fake news,' and how it could be used to Yassa's advantage. You almost tune him out, but then he mentions the Baashidi, and how they could be made friends. Convince Beeragga's neighbors that they're planning a war of aggression so they launch a preemptive strike, and then swoop in to rescue Beeragga from the problem of your own making.\n\nPerhaps out of boredom, or sheer curiosity, you approve of the plan."

His first words are a triumphant "It is done!"\n\nYou blink as you search your memory for what that could possibly mean. Before you have a chance to question him, however, another face comes trailing after him. You recognize him immediately as an ambassador from Beeragga. As soon as he begins to explain the plight of his people and all but begs for your help, the pieces finally come together in your mind.\n\nWith a smile, you reassure the ambassador that Beeragga will have Yassa's complete support."

With the help of Uwakila Baashi, we were not only able to convince Beeragga's neighbors of our phony war, but our own troops were successful in repelling the subsequent invasion into Beeragga's lands, much to Beeragga's gratitude. You've had all the expected gains in relations with Beeragga, of course. But perhaps more notably, the whole incident has also brought Yassa closer to Uwakila Baashi as well. One of the greatest developments has been a partnership between Uwakilan and Yassa merchants in Baashidi lands.\n\nBefore, distrust of lizardfolk among humans had made it difficult to conduct robust trade with them. Since the war, however, you've learned that Uwakilan merchants have begun to act as intermediaries between Yassa merchants and Baashidi they wish to conduct business with. As it turns out, having a human able to vouch for your trustworthiness goes a long way toward getting other humans to trust you."

In my examinations of the Spire, I discovered that a community of Merfolk had made a home of submerged portions of the structure! While the upper levels had been of no trouble to navigate, those lower levels were hereto locked away from us."\n\n"Now, however, the Merfolk have proven amicable to acting as our eyes in the lower levels, and have already begun reporting back what they've managed to find. While we have yet to learn anything incredibly substantive, there are signs that point to something more in the city of Nazhni. Perhaps there lies the full story of the 330th Empire which you seek..."\n\nThe letter goes on, but what you've already read has you grinning.

You had long believed that to be true yourself, before your scholars had managed to gain access to the libraries of Nazhni. Their research and synthesis has finally paid off with an exciting revelation- the 330th Empire was not simply ruled by any lizardfolk. It was ruled by Mashkay Lizardfolk.\n\nYour jubilation at this news is matched by that of everyone else who is present. Never before had your people known that the legacy of the 330th Empire was uniquely theirs to claim- yours to claim, even. There are more developments regarding the maritime and administrative capabilities of the 330th Empire, but you know what's truly invigorated you.\n\nYou now have a mandate to reconquer the lands of the 330th Empire."

It was perhaps not so daring a dream as building the 333rd Empire, but it was still a daring dream indeed. He had seen how lizardfolk were shunned by other races, and he dreamed of a day where lizardfolk would one day be welcome into any port, regardless of who owned it. That your kind might be treated not as monsters to be slain, but as equals who can be dealt with in various ways.\n\nNow, in your own lifetime, it seems that dream is becoming a reality. While there is still hostility in some quarters to your kind, your efforts have not gone unrewarded. Lizardfolk merchants and travelers are now welcome in many ports across Sarhal, free to conduct business or visit as freely as any other sapient could. In turn, the ports of Yassa have freely welcomed visitors of all different kinds of races, from the familiar humans and halflings, to far more exotic races you had never even heard of before.\n\nThis increase in acceptance has correlated with an increase in the variety of tales in our libraries, as returning natives and fresh visitors alike come to share stories of exotic lands."

Raids by the Ashhana were an all too common part of life for your realm. The Ashhana were almost a feral mob, and like clockwork they struck any new fort not long after it had been fully erected or repaired. You knew a more permanent solution to the problem they posed was necessary, but you didn't yet know what that might be.\n\nSuddenly, a guard catches your attention. He indicates that some Ashhana had been taken prisoner by your forces during the battle. For a moment, you allow your frown to fade. You swiftly order that the Ashhana be kept imprisoned until further notice, and then begin pondering your next moves. Perhaps, just perhaps, this could be the key to discovering how to deal with the Ashhana for good."

In bygone days, the Ashhana were as reasonable a people as any other, engaging in trade and diplomacy with their neighbors. Whatever had brought them so low, perhaps they could be brought back to reason again...\n\nYour reading is interrupted as a member of the Council barges into the library. "My liege," he begins, before you even have the time to address him. You begrudgingly turn your gaze away from your book and toward him, and he takes the opportunity to launch into his point. In too many words, he explains his belief that the Ashhana had simply fallen astray, and by showing them civilization, they might be brought back to their old ways.\n\nYou cut him off before he can continue, curtly granting him permission to test his theories. Truthfully, you're more concerned with getting him to leave you alone than with the potential validity of his ideas. Fortunately, that's enough. He thanks you profusely before scurrying off."

The Council member begins explaining that he had taken the Ashhana to various towns in order to attend local festivals, and this seemed to have the desired effect of bringing her back to reason.\n\nYou cut through his speech to address the Ashhana, asking for her perspective on what had happened. She's silent for a moment, and you briefly wonder if this wasn't all some elaborate ruse at your expense. But she does finally speak- clearly and coherently, at that. "I'm not entirely sure, specifically... But I remember seeing all sorts of wonderful crafts and pictures as I traveled. And the more I saw, the more I felt like...

Yet in recent years, some genuinely brilliant and useful ideas have emerged, like diamonds in the rough, and more people are beginning to see the potential utility in the Council.\n\nIndeed, such has been the upsurge in influence that the Council is no longer only the domain of the foolish and the dreamers, even if they still have a place within the Council's ranks. Dedicated seats for Ashhana artists and engineers, for the diligent merchants of Yassa, and even some of the esteemed naga have all joined with them, eager to participate in the exchange of ideas that the Council represents.\n\nWith so many segments of society seeing influence in the Council, it seems only right to legitimize it. You order that the Council be integrated fully into the official workings of the government. With some guardrails to weed out the truly awful ideas and systems to encourage productive lines of discussion, you hope that this will maximize the benefits of the Council while minimizing its flaws."
