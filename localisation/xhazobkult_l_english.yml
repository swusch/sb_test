 xhazobkult_events.101.d:0 "As the saying goes, ask ten different gnolls what the Xhazobkult is and you will get eleven different answers. This is what the Xhazobkult truly is; a collection of folk traditions, rituals and practices rather than an organized religion. However, such details escape the civilized world. To them the Xhazobkult is merely a bastion of demon worship with no nuance or cultural history.\n\nAs we progress down the path towards joining the civilized world perhaps it would be best for us to abandon the more demonic elements of our faith.\n\nOur nation has long integrated elements of the so-called "civilized religions", and a public conversion to one of these faiths could enhance our standing in the world."

Someone, or something was scrying on them, using a method they did not know how to counter. This was frustrating, but [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] was fairly certain that it relied on some sort of sympathy. With the capital in their grasp, the scryer had plenty of personal items, and people, to draw from. This by itself was worrying. The hunters were worse.\n\nThey were gnolls, [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] was certain. But they were silent for gnolls. None of the usual vocalizations. The snarling, the laughing, nothing of the sort. They were mute. And they knew magic.

But [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] knew with a grim certainty that they were waiting. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] was used to assassins, but this feeling of being hunted was exhausting.

The guard was doubled, wards were set in place, and we were certain that whatever magical blow was struck against us, we would counter it.\n\nAnd when the blow came, our wards did indeed spring to work. Our guards were ready, and the fighting was fierce, but our foes struck from the darkness itself, blurring the line between the waking world and some twisted dreamscape as they invaded [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s resting place. \n\nIn the end, it was too little. Many of the shadows were slain, but our wards were shaken, then breached. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had seemingly been struck with some curse, for [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was locked in a torpor, even as the battle raged around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. A shadow reached [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and they both vanished. \n\nThis was a defeat, but even now our mages are analyzing the battle, and they believe they have found a countermeasure.

Screams and cries echoed in the surrounding night - pleas of the doomed, swallowed by ever-more-fervorous chants, building to a crescendo.\n\nAt first, silence. The wind stilled. The stars dimmed. The fires ceased their crackling. And then, a sound. A deep, guttural rasp, like claws dragging over stone.\n\n"You call to me, supplicant." The air twisted, though the smoke remained formless and twisted. "You come to beg for power, to claim dominion over mortal flesh and flame. But power is not given - it is bought with blood, with pain, with life."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] knelt, baring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] claws to the great demon, voice steady despite the growing weight on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest.\n\n“I seek your favour, great Xhazob.

A torrent of demonic energy surged outward, siphoned from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] into the smoke, now shifting to form a gaping, grinning maw.\n\n"I demand strength, mortal. A river must flow from you to me. I will feed until I deem your meagre offerings enough. And know this: should you falter, your flesh will be my feast, your soul my toy for eternity."\n\n"Bring me the blood of a thousand thousand souls.

Lesser demons have crawled forth from these smaller pyres to join the carnage, summoned by the vile celebrations of the horde.\n\nIn the centre of this orchestra of sin lies the grand pyre unto which [Root.Monarch.GetName] has spent the last week casting thousands of sacrifices to their fiery doom.
