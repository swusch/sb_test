 mother_akasik.5.t:0 "Righting the wrongs of the past"
 mother_akasik.5.d:0 "During the Aspect of justice every child of Akasik is expected to resolve all pending matters in their lives, all unsettled grudges and all unpaid debts, today we come to cut out one of the longest grudges we have harbored, two aspects ago a merchant came to our shores, wounded and malnourished having lost his wares, we gave him a hearth to rest, a ship to get back to his home and some wares to get back on his feet, as Her compassion expects of us, and he paid us for it with a dagger, when he pled an oath to one of our rivals and swore an oath to them, he began amassing power by seizing the wealth of our merchants who lived abroad thinking that we would never retaliate.\n\nAnd there the matter stood when the cycle of justice began, unable to act against him while he grew fat on our wealth, but today is different, the son of this man has just landed on our shores, twenty years of age it seems, an enterprising young man seeking to make a deal, seemingly unaware of what his father has done to us, we will not harm the lad, for now, but we will make sure his father knows and present him with a choice, he may pay back the damages he has caused to our people, or he may choose to ignore us, then his son will never leave Her shadow again and we will come to collect our debts ourselves."
 mother_akasik.5.a:0 "He never payed, nor did he see his son again."
 
 mother_akasik.6.t:0 "Wrong place wrong time"
 mother_akasik.6.d:0 "Among the legal codes of the 3 ancient Akasi nations there are both many similarities and differences, the source of these codes vary from nation to nation depending on who influenced them more. The Khasani take a lot from the ancient damerian code of law, flexible and complete, with almost all nations of the Dameshead, and many in the rest of Cannor, following it to this day.\nThe Ekhasi for their part have always been more closely associated with Fangaulan law and its more… strict aspects, prioritizing the upholding of order and the authority of the judge, a code both rigid and pragmatic but one that maintains the republic united.\n\nThe Deshaki for their part take from the Ketheratans and their more reverent interpretation of the law, theirs is a literalist interpretation of the law, one as rigid and just as the Mother Herself valuing what is written on text more highly than others.\n\nBut one aspect we all share is that, as the aspects vary so does our interpretation of law, during the aspect of compassion and reciprocity crimes are met with heavily reduced penalties, as redemption is encouraged in our people as well as forgiveness, in times of resilience each trial is heavily revised again and again, to ensure that the fairest punishment is given, lastly in the time of justice the penalties of all crimes are greatly increased as all interpretations become harsher, such is the case for one foreign merchant, who, not knowing this tried his luck and evaded a tax for some of his products, he was of course found out, under normal circumstances this would be of little importance and would only carry a small fee, but now he is charged with 4 years of prison, his home country demands his safe return and this could escalate to a diplomatic incident."
 mother_akasik.6.a:0 "We will not compromise, increase his sentence by one year."
 mother_akasik.6.b:0 "This time we’ll have to compromise, bloodshed will not bring us justice."
 
 mother_akasik.7.t:0 "A plea from the mountains"
 mother_akasik.7.d:0 "During the 12 years that mark the aspect of resilience harpies become a rare sight in Akasik, as they have a harsh interpretation of our Mother’s aspects, resilience for them becomes a period of total isolation, as they tend to hide themselves in their mountain communities and refuse any communication with the outside world (to an even greater degree than usual at least), even the most open of the flocks is expected to remain completely guarded from all contact, and if it is found that any flock has breached this expectation the consequences for their transgressions are often bloody, as more than one flock has met its downfall in defiance of this directive.\n\nAnd even knowing all of that today one of the leaders of the Ikhsat flocks has come to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seeking an audience, her tone seems dire and she demanded an audience to be granted to her. “This cannot wait until the aspect ends, my people need me, I can’t just wait and see them die” [Root.Monarch.GetName] sighed and glanced at the woman in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], it's clear she had seen better times, her frame betrayed that she had once stood taller than what she was able to muster now, and her ribs showed the first signs of malnutrition encroaching, “And would you have me break Her law, you know what will happen to me, what may happen to you” - she shivered and stared blankly before recovering her wit - “It doesn’t need to end like that, it’s true we cannot offer much in return for your aid but I plead you, we barely have enough to feed our fledgelings and our most apt hunters were injured during the last storm, we cannot meet the Ikham yet, my flock has more to do, more purpose than just to die this cycle.” There is virtue in acts of mercy when we seek isolation ourselves, live and let live, She teaches us this, to help each other in times of strife and uplift our kin by our own capacity, is that not the meaning of resilience?"
 mother_akasik.7.a:0 "If resilience impedes us from helping our own there is no meaning to introspection."
 mother_akasik.7.b:0 "Banish these thoughts, resilience is how we elevate ourselves, not others."

 mother_akasik.8.t:0 "A brawl in the port"
 mother_akasik.8.d:0 "To most outsiders we are a strange people, some call us both mercurial and stubborn in our disposition, those who do not understand us simplistically divide us into two stages that according to them change at seemingly random intervals. Their fundamental lack of curiosity and perception is deeply disappointing, and if they only did the bare minimum research we wouldn’t have to endure so many misunderstandings.\nToday one such misunderstanding occurred in one of our ports when a Bulwari merchant came to one of the shops there and bought some items, he tried to bargain with the shopkeeper, and said shopkeeper trying his best to be pious and to keep with the aspect of resilience refused to bargain profusely, even so the merchant insisted until eventually tempers flared up, the shopkeeper said some unfortunate words and the whole matter ended up in a brawl in which several items from both the shopkeeper and the merchant ended up being broken, who do we favour?"
 mother_akasik.8.a:0 "There’s a line between resilience and rudeness, repay the merchant."
 mother_akasik.8.b:0 "The merchant tried to push his luck and he found the end of it."

 mother_akasik.9.t:0 "Sticking to the old ways"
 mother_akasik.9.d:0 "In the aspect of resilience we are encouraged to look inwards and to reflect, this means that at this time most of our people are not very receptive to change. This has come into the forefront lately when the opposing party to one very important relating to the collection of taxes upon the holy orders has successfully managed to outmaneuver the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and has stalled the reform until now, now a reform that just needed a small last push forward has become a nightmarish deadlock clogging up the entire bureaucratic apparatus of our nation, no one wants to give the final approval and there are voices of dissent, even among the supporters of the reform, that claim it may be better to scrap the idea and to come back later to it in the next aspect of reciprocity, the issue cannot be delayed any longer and the burden of deciding falls onto us, should we use our authority to push the reform through or will we await for the changing of the aspects?"
 mother_akasik.9.a:0 "Pass the reform, resilience be damned."
 mother_akasik.9.b:0 "We can manage without this reform, denied."

 mother_akasik.10.t:0 "Breaking the Shell"
 mother_akasik.10.d:0 "As the time of resilience reaches its dusk the Stonewings begin to shake off from their isolation, as always the first day we see them again is the very day of festivities known as Asaresh, the sharing, for 12 days we celebrate and rejoice among each other; but there is a more political component to this sharing too. The harpies of Akasik, few as they are are not a cohesive group, their isolation means that their flocks are of a small size even for harpy standards, as such when the time of resilience ends and they begin to once again turn their gaze outwards they come to our court to ask of the latest news of the world and the ongoings of our state, the act of which flock to favour and how to properly balance all of them is an intricate game of diplomacy all in itself, with the lesser flocks the Ikhsat, and the greater flocks, the Akhrat, fight for the favour of the state and primacy in the election of mates, the sharing of maps and the partition of supplies, the question is, how will [Root.Monarch.GetName] aim to resolve these conflicts on this occasion?"
 mother_akasik.10.a:0 "As stated by tradition they will be attended to based on their standing."
 mother_akasik.10.b:0 "Favour the flocks with planetouched among them."
 mother_akasik.10.c:0 "They will attend the silver council as always."
 mother_akasik.10.e:0 "Let the brightest of them come forth."
 mother_akasik.10.f:0 "One from each flock may renew their oath, then they will be attended."
 mother_akasik.10.g:0 "A united Akasik includes all who live under the Mother’s shadow, there will be no favoritism among her children."

 mother_akasik.11.t:0 "A proper way to show virtue"
 mother_akasik.11.d:0 "In Akasi society the aspect of compassion means many things, from the increase in diplomacy with those outside of Akasik, to the deposition of tyrants, but the most awaited one by the most Akasi is without a doubt the general increase in charity, any virtuous person must of course be charitable so long as they can afford to, and the more you can afford the more you should contribute. The state is no exception on this matter, and it is expected that the state and institutions that uphold it, as the most powerful pillars of society will be the ones to grant the most significant contributions, our people are eager to see what we will grant as charity, and this time [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to…"
 mother_akasik.11.a:0 "… grant a general tax cut and donate some silver coins to the poor."
 mother_akasik.11.b:0 "… divert part of the army to improve infrastructure and aid the citizens."
 mother_akasik.11.c:0 "… Give them nothing!"

 mother_akasik.12.t:0 "Dreaming of what lies beyond"
 mother_akasik.12.d:0 "The Stonewing harpies have always been hunted, in more than one sense, before the skies darkened and the seas roared they came to our lands fleeing a genocide enacted by the one they call “Beastbane” that saw so many of their kind slaughtered; and ever since they’ve been scarred by the memory of it, maintaining a scared and cautious attitude towards the outside world. Using us as their primary mediators and refusing to interact with any non-akasi. Of course, as always there are exceptions to this, and even among the stonewings there are ones that imagine what lies beyond their small world, a fledgeling by the name of Shabat has recently expressed her dream of seeing what lies outside of Akasik to us. She asks that [Root.Monarch.GetName] grant her an exception to allow her to embark on one of our merchant fleets. She is the daughter of one of our admirals and has the full support of her father in this endeavor, to grant her this pardon however would no doubt greatly enrage many of the harpies of our nation who see this fledgling as a hopeless rebel who may incite her peers to take other reckless actions, ending the isolation their people have maintained for more than 41 cycles."
 mother_akasik.12.a:0 "Grant her the pardon and allow her to spread her wings."
 mother_akasik.12.b:0 "Tradition exists for a reason, in time she will understand."

 mother_akasik.13.t:0 "Stories from overseas"
 mother_akasik.13.d:0 "Recently the mountaintops have been filled with chatter, far more than usual given the nature of the Stonewings, as hatchlings go back and forth between flocks sharing the news; young Shabat has recently written a letter back home detailing her journey until now. Even though it is supposed to be a letter it reads more like a journal, detailing the experiences she’s lived until now and giving extensive descriptions of how the outside world looks like.\n\n The fledglings are absolutely entranced by these lectures, some of the few who know how to read making big public lectures to their friends and nestmates, and those who can write have dedicated themselves to making rough copies of the letters, while most parents have banned them from reading or listening to these letters they often can’t stop them from sneaking outside to meet on some cave or from smuggling some scrolls in. One quote from this journal has reached our court and is of particular interest to us.\n\n“We’ve always been taught to hunt for safety and to hunt for sustenance in the Mother’s body, but maybe we can aspire to more than that, were we not given wings so we could see farther than anyone? Did Mother not grant us the strength to live and accompany our friends and to face the world together? The outside treated us unkindly before but it has changed, our kin has changed, we have not. I have been to places where I was met with hostility and suspicion, as well as places where I’ve met those who our kin call friends where they ate and talked with me as equals, the world that hated us gets father away with each day, and yet we keep locking ourselves beneath Her shadow and atop Her peaks. Is this what She wanted for us? Maybe… Maybe we can have a hunt that doesn’t consist of mere survival…"
 mother_akasik.13.a:0 "A hunt to see all of the wonders our Mother has put on this world!”"

 mother_akasik.14.t:0 "A hero’s welcome"
 mother_akasik.14.d:0 "Again Akasik is filled with chatter and gossip, but this time the chatter comes not from the mountains, but from the ports. Young Shabat is finally returning to her homeland from a 4 year long journey, as a result of this Khasa is filled to the brim with harpies, a rare sight indeed. They eagerly wait to see their idol return home; when she makes landfall she is met by many faces, old friends, her sister, and brand new admirers excited to hear of her exploits overseas. She tells them of the marvelous things she’s seen in her travels, the wonder of Port Jaher, the gloom of Nathalaire, the Impressive hold of Oval Tûngr, the sun-touched city of Brasan, of the great library of Koroshesh…\nShe spared no effort on telling them all of the details, and so they didn't leave the docks until dusk, the young one filling their heads with excitement at the Idea of seeing what the wider world had to offer. It is clear for all now, even for the more orthodox members of harpy society, or the most puristical of the Akasi. The unification of Akasik heralds a new era, and our sisters will go along with us there."
 mother_akasik.14.a:0 "Winds of change are upon us, a brighter dawn for us and our kin!"

 mother_akasik.15.t:0 "Loyalty of the flock"
 mother_akasik.15.d:0 "The leader of the Ikhsat flock we aided cycles ago has come to us in yet another private meeting, this time the one who comes is not the old matriarch but her daughter. “My mother told me what you did for us years ago, she was always very bitter about not being able to give her thanks in a proper way for fear of retribution by the other flocks, I think it's the only regret she had really, I come to fix that, debts like these can never be repaid,and so I should not fear repercussions, we would’ve been long dead had it not been for you, what I do is paramount to trying to fill a cave with droplets” she hands you a scroll detailing all the flock will grant in exchange for the help and an oath loyalty for as long as the mountains endure."
 mother_akasik.15.a:0 "The Mother properly rewards acts of kindness."
 
 mother_akasik.16.t:0 "Seeking new ideas"
 mother_akasik.16.d:0 "During the aspect of reciprocity we are encouraged to listen to other people and discover new ideas and ways of thinking, it does not mean that we need to embrace them of course, lately there has been an influx of Cannorian merchants who know that this is one of the best aspect to make commerce with us, and they’ve brought their ideas with them, in some cases they are using the cultural advances and new technologies they know as a bargaining chip in commerce, should we support this trend?"
 mother_akasik.16.a:0 "Knowledge is the best for a merchant, it costs little, is worth much, and doesn’t occupy any space."
 mother_akasik.16.b:0 "Ideas ramble, but silver speaks."
 mother_akasik.16.c:0 "We can offer more than cheap trinkets, hire one of these travelers."
 
 mother_akasik.17.t:0 "Conflicts in the court"
 mother_akasik.17.d:0 "During the aspect of reciprocity our faith encourages us to listen to other points of view and to be open to change, this is a great virtue of ours, in this time we shake off our 24 years of stagnancy and start to catch up and surpass the rest of the world. However, a recurring problem we face is the fractiousness of our people during this time, new ideas don’t necessarily mean good ideas, and we all know that, the problem is actually agreeing on which ideas are actually good and which ideas are not. Our court has recently been divided into 2 factions, those who support a significant legislative change and those who oppose it. We have to pronounce ourselves on the issue, or things could spiral out of control."
 mother_akasik.17.a:0 "Support the reform and go even beyond."
 mother_akasik.17.b:0 "Grant the reform faction tacit approval."
 mother_akasik.17.c:0 "Deny the reform."

 mother_akasik.18.t:0 "Guided by storms once more"
 mother_akasik.18.d:0 "During the early 1400s the harpy population in Akasik fell massively as Viakkoc hunted them down and used them for their foul rituals, many had to do the unthinkable and flee, flee to Sorncóst flee to Tetun where we knew they would be safe under our friends’ care, a refuge we all knew couldn’t last, and now that Akasik is free once more they yearn to return to their rightful home, some even crossing the Divenhal by themselves like they once did from the Khenak.\n\nAnd as they come back and settle once more on now empty roosts, where once there were children playing and the everpresent song of a flock, now the only sound that’s heard is the cries of mothers and daughters who lost all they had, and the small rhythm of hope still drowned by tears."
 mother_akasik.18.a:0 "Tears enough to reach Her snowy peaks."
