 drozma_tur_events.6.t:0 "Warrior and Scholar Seekers"
 drozma_tur_events.6.d:0 "A few tales have reached the court about lone wanderers or riders in our country seeking out talented fighters, mages, scholars and other skilled individuals offering them work in a far off place. Naturally in these dark ages there are few who would accept such offers and even fewer to be worth asking. However, It is a bit rude to go around trying to poach people who should by right and law serve their Lords, thus it may be wise to put an end to this recruitment."
 drozma_tur_events.6.a:0 "Let them be, what do I care."
 drozma_tur_events.6.b:0 "Find these vagrants and send them away."

 drozma_tur_events.7.t:0 "Imariel’s Regency Ends"
 drozma_tur_events.7.d:0 "After the death of Lord Aranthiv his mother ascended to the throne of Gomosengha. A gnarled, thin, yet serene old lady, Imariel’s reign proved to be stable and peaceful despite worries about disorder caused by the faltering faith in the dead Dragon God and potential invasions from ambitious neighbours. Now Imariel has left the throne to her granddaughter, whose great talent grown of good tutelage is marred only by deep ambition to become the great Duke her father was robbed of life too early to be."
 drozma_tur_events.7.a:0 "May her might grow."

 drozma_tur_events.8.t:0 "The Birth of a God"
 drozma_tur_events.8.d:0 "A warrior from a far flung lodge and monastery most rudely rushed upon the gates of Gomosengha, demanding entry from the local Lady. Upon admittance they brought forth scale and eggshell before the court and proclaimed in certainty that on the day of the eleventh of the eleventh fourteen and fourty-four did a secret heir to the Dragon God hatch in a far northern valley.\n\nRejoice, for thus to ye I reveal the living son of Drozmagog, the Prince of Change and Lord of Fire: Varlengeilt, Terror in Green.\n\nThe young Dragon God has been kept hidden in the Dolenmach moors where he has been taught by scholars and warriors alongside several other young heroes to defend him. In time this order was to reveal the Dragon Prince to the world but the newsbearing warrior claims they kept him secret for their own gain, seeking to wield this power for personal benefit and ambition. His words have spread aflame through all nations of faith and we must quickly make a decision on what we make of this new God and our course of action toward him."
 drozma_tur_events.8.a:0 "Let him stay in the Dolenmach, our god needs a long education."
 drozma_tur_events.8.b:0 "We must make safe the Dragon Prince, for his own good of course."

 drozma_tur_events.13.t:0 "Worrying Rumours"
 drozma_tur_events.13.d:0 "A shadow once flew above the river, a visage of fire and green deceit, yet it was slain by Artorean of Arganjuzorn long ago and only its memory may haunt us.\n\nNot so.\n\nOut of the north and west come tales of the heir to Drozmagog, a new dragon to unite the disparate rzentur followers and bring anew the heathen host’s assault on all good chivalric Lords of the One River."
 drozma_tur_events.13.a:0 "We must be ready."

 drozma_tur_events.14.t:0 "The Dragon Ascendant"
 drozma_tur_events.14.d:0 "For long years the Divine Hatchling was kept safe and protected for his tutelage to be successful and his wisdom and might to be as great as we could give. Now upon the River-Cycle of the Dragon we declare and present our God to the world.\n\nTo Svemel the followers have been called in hundreds and thousands to give praise to the young Prince. Rzenta and all faithful are awash with joy and triumph, for we endured the dark days in mourning of Drozmagog and are now rewarded, here to see his Heir arise. Hear oh Tur, followers! Hear oh Ynn, great river! Bow for the Son of God! Praise the Prince of Change! Fear the Lord of Eternal Fire!"
 drozma_tur_events.14.a:0 "Sing aloud in worship..."

The Avarkavalk are knowledgeable stewards and pioneers as economists, their service to the dragon god comes in the form of ensuring healthy and growing flows of money within the community of the faithful."
