 rayaz_1_1_title:0 "It Goes In The Family"
 rayaz_1_1_desc:0 "My brother Katyradz was always a lively person. Between him, me and Ayralgaz, he was always the most passionate and confident - brash, you could say. It was probably because of that overconfidence that the Naga favoured me over him. Perhaps they thought he could stand on his own, with less support. Perhaps it was a way to temper his spirit, so he didn't become blinded by his success, and sought to strike out on his own.\nStill, he did the latter - and it has borne him fruit. As a sellsword to the Karasskas, he kept the human frontier under control well - and now has finally risen up against his employers, sneakily capturing the broken spire in the process. I cannot fully support his venture right now - but I want to help him as much as I can. The collapse of Karassk is a boon to all, and for him to fail would be a missed opportunity to vanquish a major pretender to my title. And above all… I can't let my sibling embarrass himself in front of the entire continent, can I?" 

 rayaz_1_2_title:0 "Crushed Dreams"
 rayaz_1_2_desc:0 "Ever since the Hail of Black Needles, Karassk became a pariah city for the Naga. They shattered a spire - of course the Naga would denounce their leaders as despoilers, unworthy of the final empire. Yet, to this day, it is also one of the wealthiest states of Taneyas, throwing around hired mercenaries to do their bidding. Unfortunately, they recently hired the wrong mercenary.\n\nAs much as I cheer for Katyradz' success, I cannot imagine his newfound autonomy lasting long. His victory gives him power, and the Naga will not abide it - I am their “champion”, after all, not him. I could try to give him other stations to appease him, but he always liked to do things “his way.” He'll likely reject whatever I give him.\nAnd if he loses? A victorious Karassk would be a thorn in my side for years. It would constrict me, always be right there, threatening my move… and their victory would embolden them, no doubt. \n\nI can only hope that whatever happens, it will only make things easier for us."

 rayaz_1_3_title:0 "Suffer No Interlopers"
 rayaz_1_3_desc:0 "After the entire western border is solidified under Rayaz, the safety of all Lizardfolk will be my responsibility. \n\nThe human hordes, abusing the failures of Anzara, have been poking and prodding at our frontier for centuries, slowly pushing us back, sometimes striking right into the heart of Taneyas. Even now, various smoothskin smugglers in our markets appear on a daily basis, circumventing whatever restrictions we want to impose on them.\n\nLuckily, I am a Riverclaw. I know the terrain of this area and the places where these interlopers go through. Spots that need to be fortified and patrolled, made impenetrable. We also need to make a navy - a true military fleet, not the captured trade-ships we have now - to patrol the newly acquired waters. Fast vessels that can board the smugglers' ships and stop them from escaping into the open sea.\n\nManage that, and we can finally secure the border for good. No Nyokyora, Aakhet or any other smoothskin warlord will ever enter Taneyas again."

 rayaz_2_1_title:0 "Legacy of Past War"
 rayaz_2_1_desc:0 "War can be a good teacher. \nI understand, now, why Zerat's cities are so large, their coffers bountiful and their armies disciplined. \nTheir administration is simply superior to ours in almost every way. They have a proper chain of command, we don't. They have supply chains, while we ravage the countryside to feed the warbands. They have proper elite regiments with quality training and the best greatmaw steeds money can provide, we pulled farm animals to serve for cavalrymen. \nNo wonder they resisted our advance.\n\nWe can't let this happen again. I have some ideas that would help transform our tribal warband into something more organised, with a defined hierarchy and clear responsibilities. It may not be received warmly but we cannot go on as we are."

 rayaz_2_3_title:0 "Triumph of the Green Party"
 rayaz_2_3_desc:0 "Khugra is a silent battlefield. Most of their ruling class, beset by some kind of a mad inferiority complex, never clawed for independence as a proud warrior should, relying on Karassk to take care of them. Now that they've been abandoned by them, the city elites bicker over who gets to be their next protector. Rayaz is but one of those powers.\n\nWith the most imminent threats dealt with, I can finally focus on seizing what I would deem as a once in a lifetime opportunity. Controlling the mouth of the Adzalas will be an unimaginable boon for us - not just the profits gained from controlling the river's Jewel, but a friendly ruling class, more than willing to be my subject? What else can I really ask for?"

 rayaz_2_4_title:0 "Secrets of Crater City"
 rayaz_2_4_desc:0 "Normally, Karshyr would be a relatively unimpressive port, eclipsed through centuries of mismanagement from their Karassian overlords, making it a place that I wouldn't be interested in. \n\nMy Naga advisors though… they have taken a particular curiosity about this, baffled about lack of their kin in the islands' native population. They talk about the rich history of its capital, placed in a dormant volcano as a supposedly good location to hide away powerful secrets. \n\nIndeed, Karshyras historians are renowned for their diligence in record-keeping, as their vaults can only be compared to those in Shangra, far at the other edge of Taneyas. Perhaps their knowledge could help me find a reason to silence the most reverent, that Karassk was never in a place to be called the Final Empire. And who knows, maybe their knowledge can lead me into some more interesting discoveries..."

 rayaz_3_2_title:0 "Fall of the Godchosen"
 rayaz_3_2_desc:0 "The Scaleguards have proven to be a tough enemy. Even at the face of imminent defeat, they indulged in their lavish lifestyle and delusional propaganda, they bribed my tribesmen to secure a little more time to prepare their defense. \n\nBut their time has come. They have failed lizardfolk too many times. It was their bickering that led to Ashhana and humans alike ravaging Taneyas far and wide. It was during their reign that lizardfolk lost two spires to foreigners. Their divine mandate to rule is over - and I have the mandate to finish them off.\nWe will destroy their legacy once and for all, and humiliate the city that enabled their lecherous behavior for so long. Portraits depicting their debauchery will be torn asunder, [L69.Monarch.GetName] and his court of fools executed. What is left of their estate will be dispersed to improve the lives of the commonfolk. A clear message, heard by all.\n\nThere will be no place for greed, decadence and corruption in the Final Empire."

 rayaz_3_3_title:0 "Replace the Decadent City"
 rayaz_3_3_desc:0 "I can tell of many of the Anzara's wrongdoings - their mismanagement, their stubbornness and pride. But in that selfishness they still served an important and perhaps forgotten function - patronage of the arts. \n\nThe Scaleguards have been patronising them well, in recent years, framing me as a “warmonger from the jungle”, no smarter than a Blood-indulging Ashhana, with no desire for cultural fulfillment, instead relishing in looting their works to fuel my next campaigns. It's worked. Many artists fear that their careers and perhaps lives may be brought to an abrupt end.\n\nIts time to prove them wrong. I have plans to revitalize this land - provide the artists with fresh resources from across my domain. New schools and temples will replace those looted by my comrades. Cities will be founded for future generations. Lake Lasadza will become a bustling centre of new lizardfolk culture again, free of the decadence of the Anzara."

 rayaz_3_4_title:0 "Clouded Mind Obscures Stars"
 rayaz_3_4_desc:0 "The citizens of Nazhni have recently taken a liking towards a dangerous lifestyle, spreading their Nazhyn weeds in a new form that supposedly frees the mind and relaxes the body. Normally, this would be fine, a way to enjoy a medicinal herb, nothing more. \nBut my advisors have noticed a particular thing about this drug - Nazhni's clients have taken a particularly toxic relationship with this good, buying more and more of it in greater amounts, amassing great debts to Nazhni's merchants. And thus, their control expands.\nUnfortunately, those advisors only told me after I indulged in it as well… and I can now agree with their conclusions from experience. To have the burden of stress lifted... but my cravings for the feeling has turned to draining obsession. \nI... can only imagine what they can demand from the people they do not fear. It simply has to be stopped. I cannot let my people and myself be enslaved in such a horrible way."

 rayaz_3_5_title:0 "As It Was Foretold"
 rayaz_3_5_desc:0 "It was bound to come, with or without me..."

 rayaz_4_1_title:0 "Those Who Come To Us..."
 rayaz_4_1_desc:0 "My state is not one where a single tribe dominates over all others. Most of our partners are here with us willingly, sharing our motivation in bringing forth the foretold empire, preferring to to be the tip of the spear, rather than face its receiving end. Their continued compliance with us is a testament of our effectiveness - a mark that my cause is just, and my victory inevitable. \n\nYet beyond our borders, there are still those who are skeptical of our success, of tribes dismissing petty grudges in favor of something greater. But if they cannot be persuaded to join me directly, they can help me in other ways. Even something as simple as good word of mouth can prove crucial for the legitimacy of my claim - my relations with these communities must not be allowed to falter. \nAt some point, their separation will become untenable, the benefits of uniting under my banner irrefusable. We only need to prepare to open our arms and welcome them."

 rayaz_4_2_title:0 "Time To Give Back"
 rayaz_4_2_desc:0 "If my legacy is to be eternal, I cannot just hoard everything for myself. The support of my allies and my own military successes gives us enormous resources that we can use in much better ways than Zerat or Karrask had, simply counting coins. That road is simply one to losing all support once there is no gain to be had. Unsustainable.\nLoyalty is something that must be nourished through acts of unprompted kindness. As the community gives to me, I have to give back to them. Like a good ruler. As of now, I have an overabundance of men that served me well in previous wars. I will allow them to go back to their communities, serving in my name for the public cause, building roads, houses, performing all of the hard tasks that experience in my warband can help with."

 rayaz_4_3_title:0 "Chieftain of All Tribes"
 rayaz_4_3_desc:0 "Most of history's emperors have hailed themselves from ancient cities, most now lost. The vast resources of these metropoli were like wind to their ascent. \n\nThat makes our own even more special. \nI started this journey with one measly tribe and worked my way up with the blessing of the Naga. I hail from the poor, scattered, backwards Arraskay, neglected by the empires of ages past. We were at each other's throats every day - and I know that we deserve better. \nAn education, to showcase our talents. Partners we can trust. Respect of the cityfolk who look down on us. That is my will - but I can only reach it with every tribe standing behind me.\n\nSo we must unite. \nThe integrity of the Final Empire cannot be based on a chaotic system of clashing and competing laws and customs and borders. One massive army to protect every corner of Taneyas. One massive budget for the projects that will bind us together. And, of course, one Chieftain Emperor to lead them."

 rayaz_5_1_title:0 "...And Those Who Defy Us"
 rayaz_5_1_desc:0 "The Ashhana were never appreciated by the Naga of my faith. In their history lessons, they described the crocodiles as savage, bloodthirsty monsters, brought down to their base instincts. I was told about how many cities were lost to them, when they flooded down from the mountains. It took almost all Lizardfolk to hold them back, but they could never be fully beaten.\n\nImagine then everyone's surprise, when the Naga brought news of my future bride. An Ashhana of the Karashan tribe I was at war with. Peace, in exchange for their fealty. The situation had changed. I understood why - as foes, these folk were not all how they were described to me... until the fight truly started, and their unnatural rage took over.\n\nDespite Karashan's fealty, they've had trouble embracing the Naga's authority, holding to their own odd customs. Anzara would force them to kneel - we see a willingness to cooperate, but we need to change our approach, encourage them to join us, forget the mindless mob that they once were. It may be our only chance to settle this peacefully."

 rayaz_5_3_title:0 "Our Cure to the Curse"
 rayaz_5_3_desc:0 "In the few years I've had so far with my wife, I have learned of the Ashhana's curse - and how the Ashhana have to live with it. Whether they want it or not. She has told me that she was sacrificed to prevent bloodshed, the cause of their affliction, the thing that makes them lose their minds. She also told me about people who indulged themselves in it. How they need to be stopped. \n\nIt is a hard choice to make, but I have come to understand there is no grey zone when it comes to the Ashhana. Each of them need to be approached with extreme empathy, or a complete lack of mercy. Those who are willing to cooperate must be isolated from those with nothing but bloodshed on their minds. If there is one man who can bring them back into the Anzalkatsa faithful, then it must be me. I can only hope that this will not end in a culling."

 rayaz_5_4_title:0 "Last of The Defiant"
 rayaz_5_4_desc:0 "Most people who enjoy my company know how hard to reach I can be. Constantly busy, cordoned off by my Naga advisors. That leaves me little time to handle issues of the chieftains and the merchants, despite my greatest efforts. Some of them actively scheme against my advisors, trying to curtail their all-important influence.\n\nBut on the other side of Taneyas, a different threat emerges. A prodigious naga king - ruling openly, against tradition - in Shalazar, who does not support my claim. It makes my advisors afraid. It makes me nervous. A precedent cannot be set. \nAt the same time, to defeat this foe, we must also defeat those who caused the Naga-King's ascent by culling the Moonwarden royal family. The Zulbur tribe stands as a behemoth across the Ashhana, a direct challenge to my efforts to bring those of accursed-blood back to the Anzalkatsa faithful.\nBut that cannot be allowed to stop us. They must be made examples, so that all may understand that our claim to the Final Empire is absolute."

 #Events
 rayaz_event.1.t:0 "Reminiscing on the Past"
 rayaz_event.1.d:0 "I stand upon a hill looking upon my warband. Thousands of warriors, from six tribes - Arazin, Yushyn, Lata, Alashkatsa, Karashan, Rayaz - stare directly at me, the weight of their gaze piercing through my body like a million spears. They wait to hear the reason that brought them all into the banks of the Adzalas. Looking at me with an awe that should be reserved only for the gods. For them, I alone need to be the perfect one, as I am the bringer of the final empire. \nOr so they say. \n\nFor I was supposed to bring it 21 years ago. When the Naga expected nothing, but a crushing victory against their banishers in Zerat. Everything was supposed to go exactly as it went in the games I played with my brothers. I was a prodigy, they said. In their illusion, I saw nothing to worry about. \nBut when I enforced it into reality, I met only a stalemate. A relentless and merciless invasion that stained Lake Lasadza red, villages and towns plundered to sustain our armies, five grueling years of war. And at its end, a peace that satisfied no one, as both sides became exhausted to the point where neither could push their advantage.\n\nAs a result, the reputation of Sykar Riverclaw was contested for the first time. My Naga advisors, they tried to keep up the facade. I think it still works to some degree, but even a blind man could see that my shimmering scales are tarnished. The vision that I was a symbol of - an idealized, perfect future - no longer seemed so inevitable. People started to have doubts. Rumors started to spread. Naga try to tell me that it's the enemy trying to undermine them. But what kind of enemy are we actually talking about? \n\nThe murmurs of the impatient tribesmen rouse me from my spiraling doubts. This is exactly the thing that I need to prevent. So I wake at last, and outline to them a plan for the following five years. Its last point - finish the wailing corpse of the 332nd, and silence those who dare contest my claim of the Final Empire."
 rayaz_event.1.a:0 "Its first point - divide the final ransom given for the last five years of truce"
 rayaz_event.2.t:0 "Life of the Chosen One"
 rayaz_event.2.d:0 "My dear child, if you're reading this, it means that I have passed away. First and foremost, congratulations on the honor of leading our kind into what is hopefully a better future. I hope this farewell will be a healing salve for your mourning heart, as you discover a few more things about your father. About my accomplishments, and “our” accomplishments.\n\nYou know how I unified the tribes, overcame their petty grievances. How I ripped out the cancer, in their extravagant palaces, which leeched off our people. How I offered refuge to those who welcomed me, and unleashed my wrath on those who did not.\nBut if you ask those who you now rule over about the cause of our success, there will always be another answer, standing alongside my name. All of those will be Naga. You would be right to think that is only natural, they want us to succeed. But that success is on their terms, not ours.\n\nMy entire life, I've been under their patronage. Growing under their keen eye, I received the best education I could along with my brothers. I could see my father grow proud as we flourished. It didn't matter - he was cast aside to make way for my ascent the moment he wasn't needed. Like most I care about. And there was nothing I could do.\n\nWith that done, the Naga's prophecy rang out across the tribes. Their plans progressed perfectly. My former enemies soon approached me with greedy eyes, looking at me as a tool. But they were to be used by other hands. The Naga told me to do what I do best, and leave all else to them. And so, I lived as the extension of their ambitions, leading their armies, while they handled my diplomacy, my administration… my feelings, my love. I couldn't even protest, lest I suffered a fate worse than death - Oblivion.\nAnd now, the snare has caught you too. Hear me, son, you must be loyal to the Naga! If you are not, they will erase the names of you and your children from history. But there is some hope I can give to you. Prove you can be useful to them, gain their respect, befriend them in a way I couldn't. If you can succeed in that, I believe you will live your life as an equal to them, unlike the slave that I was.\n\nI wish you best of luck in that, my child - hell awaits. I pray you will be ready."
 rayaz_event.2.a:0 " P.S. Never take that stupid Nazhyn. The withdrawals are like ripping scales."
 rayaz_event.3.t:0 "We Were Never Alone"
 rayaz_event.3.d:0 "Despite how it may appear on the map, my domain isn't as united as it may seem. Many of the tribes that willingly joined Rayaz remain very powerful in their own lands. Their participation under my rule is held solely by their good faith and the belief in the prophecy.\nThis delicate state of affairs is now threatened by my brother, Katyradz, betraying our alliance and choosing a path of his own. He is a part of the prophecy as well - and that makes him a viable option to replace me, and claim my mantle as the bringer of the Final Empire. This fact alone is enough to cause trouble, with the more opportunistic tribes starting to “renegotiate” my relationship with them.\nAnd now, the chieftains of Lata and Alashkatsa came before me to do just that. Their terms: Give them autonomy, or risk their secession."
 rayaz_event.3.a:0 "And it is outrageous! I will never allow such weakness!"
 rayaz_event.3.b:0 "And, of course, we cannot afford to lose them. So it is."
 rayaz_event.4.t:0 "Fate of the Bulwark States"
 rayaz_event.4.d:0 "A remnant of a failed policy, the bulwark states served Zerat for many years, as both protectors of their realm from foreign threats and as retirement homes for the disgraced members of their large family. \nThose states now offer us their loyalty and help in pacifying their more rebellious kin, in exchange for a great deal of autonomy on their lands. The Yushyn in particular, who have previously joined our cause, are now expecting to be repaid for their initiative in joining the right side of the conflict.\n\nBut at the same time… this offer will only give refuge to those who we had tried to oust from power. We were supposed to scour Zerat, once and for all. Would this really accomplish that?"
 rayaz_event.4.a:0 "We know who you are, no need for your services"
 rayaz_event.4.b:0 "This war has claimed too many souls, grant their request"
 rayaz_event.5.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 rayaz_event.5.d:0 "With the dawn of the Final Empire, a decision must be made on where its seat of power will lie. Many cities were sponsored in an effort to hopefully perform this function and now we are blessed with many good options to choose from. Which one will it be?"
 rayaz_event.5.a:0 "I'd rather stay here, in safety of the jungle"
 rayaz_event.5.b:0 "Move to the center of science, culture and commerce we cultivated"
 rayaz_event.5.c:0 "No place is as accessible as the shore"
 rayaz_event.5.d1:0 "A more central position could be very beneficial"
 rayaz_event.5.e:0 "No matter where it would be, it belongs near the spires"
 rayaz_event.6.t:0 "Humiliated and Vulnerable"
 rayaz_event.6.d:0 "Asarta has been defeated. Perhaps it is time to embrace the protection of the better situated brother?"
 rayaz_event.6.a:0 "Yes"
 rayaz_event.6.b:0 "No"
