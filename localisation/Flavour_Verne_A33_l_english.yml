 A33_the_vernman_renaissance_desc:0 "Not a stupid question at all - quite perceptive! Indeed, we did not follow Cannor in its vain lust for all things elven, in its memories of Dameria. Not all the way, at least. We took what made sense, we Vernmen did, without forgetting the dark shadow at Cannor’s back, the bloody tragedy of Escann. In their grief they brought to us the memory of the knight, the young lad willing to be made foolish for a cause!\n\nI saw you with that one by the bar... an idiot, no? But earnest, and charming. We Vernmen know even an idiot can be a hero, if he is good at his core. Everywhere else, rebirth meant knowledge alone - even our friends the Eborthíli are more of the mind than the spirit, even now... it is no insult! It is merely this - think what a fool our Corin must have seemed to the clever and the sensible."

Then a level up from that, the fisher lads who never leave the Gulf, the freightsmen who do two trips a day from Stingport. Waters and waters and waters, radiating out.\n\nS’easy to forget now, with the great warehouse city and the wharfs, that this is where we first looked out from Cannor, this is where we dared most, dreamed most. Go anywhere around the world, find any lad with a great moustache. Even if he’s never been here, he had to go through here, up in his head. We all do."

Inside, three commanders – each sporting a completely bespoke uniform of gaudy reds, golds, purples, and greens – argue at the top of their lungs in peculiarly provincial accents. They refuse to listen to one another, shouting that their own extensive experience means they obviously know better than all the others.\nThe recruit scurries along before he’s spotted, and soon heads to a group of seasoned soldiers. Worried by the argument, and the boorish behaviour of his new commanders, he asks the soldiers: “Brothers, why are our commanders... um... these people?”\n\nIn response, several voices pipe up excitedly:\n“Have you seen Darkheart’s helmet? I’m told he slew a demon and now wears its horns!”\n“Ha! Gnollsbane routed two bands of gnolls by herself, she even made a necklace out of their fangs!”\n“Well, Fisherman is said to have stolen a ship from the Pearlsedge lobsters!”\nA burst of laughter comes over the crowd before settling down.\n\nImpressed by the achievements, the recruit is reassured. They then ask, with a gleam in their eyes: “What about us? Do you think we will ever become commanders?”\n\nThe answer to this question is ingrained in any Vernman. Several soldiers reply in unison: “Glory is for those who act first, so charge forth and show you are no mere soldier. Earn proof of great deeds and rise above the rest! Then, you shall be a proud Vernman !”\nAnd a great reckless smile carves itself across the soldier’s eyes as they all flash trinkets and baubles, each gathered from enemies they defeated.\n\nSuch is the way of the Vernman, vainglorious adventurers fighting under the Wyvern banner.

We are now presented with something similar - how to get the enormous metallic corpse of a dragon across an immense span of water.\n\nAt first, we considered teleportation, though the precision and distance involved make this in all likelihood impossible, even were we to unite every mage in our realm and focus them on a single purpose (difficult enough once the number of mages in question exceeds two). Wyverns were an obvious secondary solution, though the sheer weight of the skeleton makes this impractical.\n\nIn the end, it took the combined mundane and magical to solve our word problem. That same magic of motion and displacement which makes teleportation possible can be made to work upon weight, and our wyverns have proven more than capable of pulling the levitated bones of the leviathan over the water. It is an act of exalted madness, one that could only have come from the venturesome spirit of the Vernman!"

The spirit of daring is not bound to any one place, after all, and we still know the deep thrumming of this shared pulse. As navigational advances have tamed the vast distances between us, we have drawn closer together and intertwined ever further. Thus we have begun to cooperate more deeply, and now Verne offers us a comprehensive naval deal: our sailors and frontier fishermen, used to the waves, will man Vernman ships, and those ships will in turn protect our waters, not just their own.\n\nThe valour of our souls - the strength of their navy. Together, we can do anything."

Such questions we are generally content to leave to the individual discerning spirit, but as our wyvernriders interweave ever more with our state, we must decide what our wyvernriders are for, when they are not at war. Soon, wyvern nests will stud all of Vernman territory, and we must decide the nature of these institutions.\n\nThe holiest among us argue that the unique blessing of wyvernriding, requiring as it does the most daring of souls, is granted to us by Corin - after all, we only remastered the art following her death. Thus, we are called to use wyverns for the benefit of the innocent. The devout conceive of a service organisation of wyvernriders, drawing from chivalric tradition and dedicated to aiding those in need.\n\nOn the other hand, we have already made great advances in the rearing of Wyverns, and the wyvernriding colleges fear a loss of focus should their mission be split. They wish to organise wyvernkeeping under a guild framework, improving the practice itself, as well as the quality and number of our bred wyverns."

 verne.117.d:0 "Absurd, no? To walk into an artificer’s workshop one morning, as the dank rain of the night dries under the risen sun, and suggest cladding a living being in pure light. For enchantment has always slid off of living things in a manner more unpredictable than with cold dead objects, and wyverns are a particular combination of sensitive and stubborn, intolerant of the whistling and humming of the transmundane. And yet on such absurdity is Vernman power built.\n\nThe key? The field, the shield, must be projected beyond the immediate perception of the wyverns, who become distressed when pervaded with such power. Affix some sort of damestear node to the saddle, however, and force out a bubble of magic, and our mages believe the majority of projectiles can be at the very minimum blunted. Bullets would be as arrows, arrows as slingstones. Corin knows they’re hard enough to hit decisively as it is."

 verne.118.d:0 "The bubble is barely perceptible; it refracts light only under certain circumstances, and never from within. The mages demonstrating the shield advertise this as a plus; they place the damestear node on a small mannequin, several hundred yards from where the courtiers and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stand. Then the head of the delegation, a diminutive fellow, releases the most beautiful, slender little fireball anyone present is ever likely to see; the whole gathering watches it arc towards the mannequin.\n\nIt would be inaccurate to say the fireball hits the shield, exactly. It seeps away, dissolving through a barrier only discernible at all in relief from the flame, like paint poured over wax-patterned paper. The mage gives a little bow at the applause - then the rifleman to his left fires.\n\nIt is as if the bullet simply loses momentum; from the moment it passes the barrier, its arc droops, and it thuds off of the mannequin’s metal plate, rebounding into the soft grass. More applause. The trials continue for much of the next thirty minutes. Only with concentrated lightning is the mage able to truly counteract the barrier; only with a volley of ten guns do the bullets finally begin to pierce the mannequin’s wooden body."

For the longest time, Vernman warships of precisely this type had approached Valourpoint docks and been greeted with open arms, supplied without question by Valourpoint docksmen. And if the Alvarists had their way, the same would happen now.\n\nOn the morning of the 17th Teysuren, the people of Valourpoint would wake as a Dominion of Verne. Their lives would not change. They would not stop being the people of Valourpoint, even, for the Alvarists were no less patriots than their opponents in government. They would bake bread, and meet for drinks, and feed the chickens, and even don their guard uniforms, and not really have their lives change at all.\n\nThey might even prefer it, after everything was said and done.

Their shared fearsome nature and nesting habits have long encouraged comparison, but wyverns are smaller, less resilient and altogether squishier than dragons, however much we may wish otherwise. No matter! We Vernmen make reality out of our desires, and of our wyverns we will make dragons.\n\nThis newest mad project was encouraged by the success of our mage shields, which while expensive render wyvern bombing runs ever safer. Now our artificers wish to make true firebreathers of our wyverns by outfitting their riders with incendiary weapons, and to clad them in mithril scale as light and as durable as that of a dragon. The meaning is symbolic as well, of course: who in their right mind wishes to face down a dragon?"

With this, we have overcome the final and perhaps most fundamental vulnerability of the magically-shielded wyvern - ranged weaponry boasting black damestear. As rifles and volley tactics have proliferated across the armies of Halann, our wyvern-doctrines have been made increasingly opportunistic, relying on skirmish and surprise as direct charges became more and more risky. Now, however, we can plough right into a company of riflemen, finally once again using the close-quarters ferocity and terror of our wyvern mounts."

 verne.122.d:0 "Wyverns have a snarl response to danger or to threat, and it was the offhand mention of this from a rider to an artificer which allowed the nebuliser breakthrough. Trials of incendiary weapons wielded by the rider found that the aim and deployment of such weapons distracted the rider from the highly-difficult juggling act of riding itself. But if the wyvern dictates when to produce the jet of flame, the rider need only use the natural boisterousness of the diving wyvern, who roars naturally at her chosen target.\n\nThe nebuliser sits at the side of the mouth, and is placed into an active mode by the rider before the dive. When the wyvern opens its mouth, the nebuliser is sprayed, followed an instant later by an automatic damestear-powered sparker. This makes the incendiary nebulisers somewhat imprecise, better for scattering formations than for picking off individual targets, but the sheer morale-breaking utility of an unstoppable gout of flame remains compelling on the battlefield."

The risks involved are deadly, the route unavoidably perilous, and the prize? Mere prestige...\n\nThe beauty of the Vernman spirit is that this was enough! Among the bold, Valenza Aucanna proved herself the very boldest, coursing along the Sarhaly coast north from Fahvanosy by dint of the Zatsarya, the strange lizard spires which dot the rim of the ocean, immense and unmistakable. Working off a local tip that they were usefully adjunct to the constellations overhead, she used the spires as secondary navigation aids to mark her way up the coast. Madam Aucanna arrived back in Stingport a full week and a half ahead of her nearest competition, and has become a celebrity overnight.\n\nIndeed, her losses in both manpower and supply have been quite extraordinarily minimal, and rumour out of the Admiralty is that her next jaunt over the seas may well be fully funded..."

 verne.124.d:0 "Since Valenza Aucanna’s astonishingly fast circumnavigation of Uelos’ Lament a year ago, the role of the strange lizard pillars, the Zatsarya, has become a matter of intense public fascination. Beyond the strange geometric perfection of their shapes and the mystery of perfect construction on such a scale so many centuries ago, Vernman scholars have become fixated on the apparent spatial relation of the spires to the stars of the night sky, hypothesising their use as ancient lighthouses and waystones.\n\nNow, out of the more radical wings of the Vernman mage establishment comes a suggestion of the impossible – the complete relocation of a Zatsarya as a specimen for study and for preservation. After all, the recording of a Zatsarya’s relationship to overhead constellations can be redone for Stingport, rendering it just as useful a waymarker as the one in New Hookfield; the pillar would then be available for detailed study and analysis close to the Vernissage and its vast ranks of expert scholars.\n\nWe believe we can use precisely the same technique we used to bring home the metallic leviathan of Taychend, albeit on an even larger scale than before. There are some trifling counterarguments, of course - ‘’it’s a massive fucking pillar”, “what are you talking about”, “that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard”, “humans are barbaric morons’’, and so on and so forth – but generally speaking the mood is very positive."

Unfortunately, even the Akasi cannot counteract the power of the Salahad’s sandstorms, and a slight weight adjustment issue has forced an unexpected landing of the Zatsarya during a refuelling stop in Ghunkorr.\n\nNo need to worry – the pillar itself is assuredly entirely fine!"

Lowered carefully by its dedicated mage cadre, the spire sank several stories deep into a vast pit, prepared just for its arrival, and was then reinforced via mass-abjuration and the addition of several buttresses. The lizard spire has travelled halfway across a continent to be here, and Stingporters practically already consider her a local!\n\nThe new spire promises to even further enrich this storied port, for of course it is not merely a solid lump of rock but a complex in and of itself, ripe for exploration. Our scholars are chomping at the bit to be allowed in, but even they must wait until we’ve had a good few weeks of celebration. She’s travelled a long way, after all, and she deserves some rest."

Such naivety never outlasts a meeting with the Holohana.”\n- Dr D.F Domenico, ‘As Ants To Ogres’\n\n\nAcanto had never been much of a Vernman. Beyond a distaste for moustaches, which he found scratchy and unbecoming on his slightly flabby, moon-shaped face, he felt he retreated from life. He had retreated from military service into a life of scholarship, dreaming of being left alone with his thoughts in the Vernissage gardens. He had retreated from Evocation into the sturdy, placid school of Abjuration. He had retreated into Insyaa scholarship because nobody else in his cohort had wanted it.\n\nThen, finally, he had retreated onto a research ship, gently pressured into a three year stint in Insyaa. And now he was here... being asked to teleport a Holohana.\n\n“They’re the size of three castles on top of one another,” Acanto said, helplessly. “And they’re alive.” It was pointless, he already knew. He had seen the look on the Director’s face in so many other Vernmen in his life. It was the look of courage and determination, the desire to make the impossible possible.\n\n“Please!” barked the Director, “- we are the nation which brought home the Leviathan. Which carried a pillar over a continent!”\n\nAcanto struggled for words. It was another Vernman trait which had escaped him - he had never been an inspiring speaker.\n\n“Putting aside that we are speaking of a distance more than three times that of the lizard pillar – that same lizard pillar which caused an entire district of a metropolis to vanish, just, if we are forgetting that – the Holohana are alive!” Acanto could feel the heat of frustration in his neck. He thought he might cry. “They’ll fight us off, and if they break free, we wouldn’t just be dropping them in a desert but, what, on top of Dhenijansar?”\n\nTo his astonishment, the Director seemed to heed him. He felt a brief surge of relief.\n\n“Indeed... we’ll have to teleport it the whole way.”\n\nAcanto crumpled.

Our collective dream and delusion is that anything we build can last.”\n- Sando Coddorran, ‘The End of Thought’\n\n\nAcanto felt the shadow of the beast wherever he walked, its great, ugly, reproachful eye, torn open and exposed. From the camp, of course, they could only see the impossible bulk of the holohana’s foot, but this one in particular was astonishingly repulsive, a creature of endless decay and regrowth. Even in its current state of constantly reapplied paralysis from Acanto’s team of mages, parts of its skin were ever-sloughing, decaying. A patch of scale on its leg was currently deeply abscessed, giving off a noxious gas which had almost killed one of the attendants. Since then, they had established a firm perimeter, refracting the paralytic field through an array of the finest Korosheshi gem-foci.\n\nToday his burden would end, of course. The Director loved his work, perversely, and had firmly encouraged him to take up leadership of the Abjuration Group. Acanto didn’t know why he’d agreed; he never knew why he agreed to anything. He knew exactly how that big rotting thing out there felt, the agony of stasis. And he knew how to stabilise its ever-rotting body for teleportation.\n\n“Ready,” he called, as the Director rattled off his teams: Divination, Abjuration, Conjuration. This was the allure of magic, see, the captivating maths of the cosmos. No matter how pointless and powerless Acanto felt, no matter how rudderless, the calculations always worked. He could lead his group, feel their intent and their magic mingle in his mind, and he could focus it on one perfect point.\n\nThe Holohana disappeared. A mountain of a thing, a creature the size of a city, gone. Acanto’s view shifted to the sending crystal, which offered a view of the enclosure which had been set aside for this monstrous thing.

It was obvious they had striven for everything in their lives, had not simply cowered from anything which didn’t come naturally to them. They had not been bullied by convention into a career, then lightly cajoled into committing a fucking atrocity.\n\n“I’m not that kind of mage,” Acanto replied, waving an arm ineffectually. “I make objects different. Sometimes that’s useful. But it’s not fast. Not reactive!” He looked at their faces and sighed. They were the same determined faces he had seen his whole life, a mirror image of the old director’s face. They would convince him to do something, and he’d do it.\n\n“Thousands are dead,” said the pretty one, with the gentle face. It was not the first time he had said this. Acanto had grown to hate Thousands-Are-Dead more than any of the others. “You have to join us. We’re flying out in under an hour, and we need someone who knows how this was done. You’ve seen the footage...”\n\nAcanto had, of course. Crystals recording the progress of the Decay Holohana, lurching and raging along a course not even the project mages could predict. It was the comeuppance of the Vernmen, the last frontier of hubris. And Acanto had made it happen. Any spell maintained on that scale for so long... well, it was a miracle the paralytic field hadn’t fluctuated earlier. But as soon as it did, the people of Verne learned the terrible truth. For all this time, for years, the holohana had been struggling, desperate to get free. Its fury in release was a terrible thing to behold.\n\nIt was impossible to know for how many people’s deaths he was already responsible. He wanted to run in the opposite direction.

They’d pieced it together after the third artificery workshop had gone up in flames, the victim of the holohana’s terrible rage. At first, the great nightmare had seemed simply to target cities, aiming for major population centres, but its destruction was eerily focused, for all that its mere footsteps across the earth left devastation in their wake. Could it feel the magic that had imprisoned it? Was this retributive rage?\n\nThe truth was that neither observation nor direct assault had done anything to slow the holohana’s advance. Wyvern-bombing had barely left a scratch on its decaying hide, while it was impossible to get enough mages together to recreate any of the initial magic which had snared the thing. Back in Insyaa, they had enjoyed the element of surprise and a clear plan. Here, they were responding on the fly.\n\nAcanto, for his part, had been vomiting off the side of the wyvern almost from the moment he’d mounted one. Tzatak had endured this with mute disdain, not even complaining at Acanto’s near constant vice grip on his waist; besides, he had much more to worry about, for the holohana was infuriated by the wyverns, especially the ones sporting mages.\n\n“Can’t get a good angle,” Tzatak seethed - “It keeps turning towards us.” And Acanto suddenly knew.\n\n“Do you know the lizard pillar in Stingport?” he asked, and from the tensing of Tzatak’s body, Acanto could tell he was understood.\n\nFor the second time in his life, he was going to make a holohana disappear."

It was a towering achievement of Vernman adventure, a treasure beyond treasure, mysterious and dangerous. It had once quite abruptly caused the entire surrounding neighbourhood to vanish. It was kept at a distance from the city these days, deferred to in its majesty.\n\nHe knew that, hearing this story, he was meant to feel patriotic; he was meant to realise the risk and the danger which good Vernmen subjected themselves to willingly, beyond all other folk. He was meant to feel the surge of glory that people feel when they put it all on the line.\n\nWell, Acanto was about to die, and he mostly just felt sick.\n\n“Are you sure?” Tzatak said, as Acanto shakily dismounted the wyvern, staggering a couple of steps before he regained his balance.\n\n“I can’t focus in the air,” Acanto said. “And I trapped it the first time. It’ll know it’s me.”\n\nTo his credit, Tzatak merely nodded. Acanto didn’t think he could’ve dealt with more talking. Once Tzatak had taken off, Acanto began to cross the field; he shifted a little to the right to avoid walking on the grass. The Zatsarya towered overhead – this close, Acanto could feel the magic wafting off it. How had anyone ever thought this thing was inert?\n\nHe could hear the roar of the holohana. The wyvern teams were still baiting it across the harbour. Acanto didn’t really know if this was going to work, but he knew the holohana knew his arcane signature. After all, the big bastard had followed him the whole way here from Pearlsedge.\n\nHe didn’t turn around. He was worried that if he saw the thing, he’d lose his nerve. He had a bundle of Korosheshi foci, and he arranged them in a simple circle set, a useless loop, one that would keep any magic he channelled into it circling endlessly, pulsing magic into the air. Stinking, specifically, of Acanto.\n\nHe cast his cantrip. He heard the shrill roar of the holohana as it surged, as it moved closer and closer. The stench hit him a moment before he remembered to be afraid – before he remembered the endless, choking decay of that nightmare above his head."

Indeed, the Akasi strategy is one we winced at repeatedly over the course of the Regatta - who can forget watching their ship bank right into the very stuff of the Stormwall with a lightning rod on the prow! Yet their planetouched have used this danger to their advantage, riding right on the edge of death for longer than any other team in the Regatta. Clearly, it’s paid off.\n\nIndeed, without a sudden squall on the water just off the coast, one wonders whether the Rude Children would have prevailed. Followed tightly by the Kheionai team, who have repeatedly proven indifferent to even the most adverse weather conditions, the Rude Children practically collided with their landing jetty.\n\nThe city authority of Ekha has declared a three-day public holiday in response to the results, the city practically bursting at the seams.

Obviously, the last stretch being home ground was no drawback.”\n\nVercane refused to comment on rumours of his parentage, still dominating the social pages, but he has nevertheless become a local heartthrob in Heartspier. “I don’t give a shit if he has gills,” says Gullamina, 19. “I’m open-minded.”\n\n-TELLUM GAMING AND SPORT-"

For Triarchy captain Mofrouns pbk-Oskoa, the team’s goal, beyond winning, was to display the technological prowess of his young nation.\n\n“Even beyond the new technology, of course, we wanted to show off an innovative form of organisation.

Faced with sudden storms, the City Boys simply activated modified shipwards adapted from those used to rebuff the kaydhano death winds, and sailed sedately into second place.\n\nGenerally avoiding open-ocean tactics, the City Boys’ enormous degárikes – essentially a supersized galley – dropped sail more frequently than any other ship in competition, using precise rowing to navigate shallow waters with astonishing agility for its size. The City Boys kept a cautious pace, withstanding the Stormwall with their ward tactics and avoiding the choppy headwinds which make circumnavigation of Ardimya so challenging. \n\nIt was another sudden squall at the very last crossing to Heartspier which the City Boys used to pull ahead of the final pack, urging their rowers – the greater portion of by far the largest overall Regatta crew – into a final, patriotic push to victory.\n\n“Everyone will celebrate, probably,” says Uronathos, “but this is obviously mostly a victory for Oktikheion.”\n\n-TELLUM GAMING AND SPORT-"

Indeed, we knew perhaps least of this team as the Regatta began, their decision-making at times completely opaque. Why, when approaching Insyaa, did they choose to extend their route by hundreds of miles by sailing north? All questions were answered when their ship stormed into first place on the back of the Great Spirit Cinulau, and they were never again behind the pack. Approaching the Sea of Lel they took a strong lead aided by the araizary water spirits of Taneyas, and retained a few even as far as the Gates of Divenhal.\n\nThe Gataw captain argues with the Kelino fellow for a good five minutes before we hear more. “Lots of things Cannorians don’t know.” When this is translated for the lizardfolk, a low laugh rumbles through the room.

She claps me on the back, and I confess my drink spills, for she is an ogre of well over ten feet, her fur dyed in complex paishléy-like patterns from head to toe. “We were just sailing on land!”\n\nShe refers, of course, to the most controversial question of the entire Regatta, one still discussed in pubs across Cannor: did the Insyaans cheat? Their detour north of Ardimya seemed completely absurd, though the analysis desk was excited to test an early theory that an isthmus route might save time, if one could make the overland transfer quickly enough. Even if the Insyaans had completely disembarked, there was no precise rule against such a manoeuvre... just the madness of the deed. Instead, the Insyaan simply sailed across land as though the sands were water, captivating audiences worldwide.\n\nSiikhiawsu explains that such a continuous feat of Insyaan song magic required rigid discipline. “We thought we’d have the biggest crew until we saw the Kheionai team - can’t run out of song over open ocean or we’d be shark food, of course.” It was a complex shift system which kept the Insyaan singers going, while their mechanim crewmates were able to maintain simpler percussive beats during their idle cycles.\n\n“We may not have had that ridiculous unfolding ship,” Siikhiawsu continues, waving an enormous tattooed arm at the Triarchy meta-pinnace berthed nearby, “but we had our voices, see!” We are interrupted by Siikhiawsu’s crew, who bail her into the harbour waters to the chorus of ‘Incantation To Make An Ogre A Pebble’.\n\n-TELLUM GAMING AND SPORT-"

Panting and breathing and the grunt of exertion, then the gentle thud of a body hitting padded ground. Leaf litter and insects and fungi, a smell of decay that, even now, is strangely pleasant. Across the border between animal, insect, fungus and plant, curiosity replaces disgust. The feeling is mutual, of course. The beetles who will soon come to strip the flesh from the Explorer’s bones have nothing against him in particular. To them, his death too will smell sweet.\n\nThe Explorer wishes he held the Relic – wishes he had made himself indispensable. It is barely anything, a little sphere intricately carved. He can imagine the blurb it will receive in some lesser-trod Exhibitionary Hall of the Vernissage. ‘Ritual purposes’, it will elegantly suggest.\n\nHis colleagues are well ahead of him now; he can hear them making for the clearing, for the little port on the coast and the boredom of the ship passage home. He can’t quite bring himself to hate them.\n\nHis foot has been sliced open to the bone. He is transfixed by the pulse of his own blood, up and out of the strange, flesh-lipped gash. He tries to imagine the flow feeding the soil – tries to imagine something good coming of this. He does not try to stop the vines as they curl around his arms and legs; when the long length of thorn punctures his neck, he wonders if it is meant as a mercy."

This is by no means the largest port in the Leechdens, nor is it the place that has suffered the most since the jungle woke. For all that, the Child cannot imagine any distance greater than that between the Corinite compound at the top of Harbour Road and the Company Requisition, where twice a week the Confectionist with her withered old hands will hand the Child a bag of rock candy, free of charge, and wink. The Company Requisition is now mostly underwater, torn open, its shelves of dry goods exposed to the sky, rotting and intestinal.\n\nThere was a jetty here; not a large one, used only for flat barges which floated lazily into dock. The jetty is simply gone, and its absence lends this island of the Leechdens an exhausted finality. The climbing vines which the jungle has locked in place now seem immortal, ever-present. It is impossible to tell them from those which were already here. When the jungle rose, it swallowed this place in minutes. It tore out the flesh and discarded the shell.\n\nThe Child’s home is intact. When the Wyvernrider arrives in a day or so, she will comb this place top to bottom, hoping at last to find a survivor. She will find a skull which has been torn clean in two and everything, still attached to it, which has yet to do the decent thing and decay.

Upon impact, the elemental is released.\n\nHe has come to love them, these spirits of fire. They exult in their freedom, igniting half a square mile in flame in the time it takes the Bomber to wheel back for home. He is rising now, soaring on the imagined heat of the updraft, though in truth the speed comes from his wyvern’s squeamishness, her natural fear of the spreading flame. He watches as the canopy catches, as the Effelai all around him is smothered in a great blanket of orange. Perhaps it is the thick, wet smoke of the Jungle, billowing in dense columns, which means he misses the movement below the tree line some distance away.\n\nAs a child, the Bomber’s father told him of the two basic tools of the sapient: the spear and the basket. The Jungle knows them too. It reaches with all its might, and the first the Bomber knows of this is the roar of pain from his wyvern. They’re in freefall. As the Bomber watches the ground rush up towards him, he only faintly registers the great pillar of thorn and briar. It has pierced the wyvern through both wings and the neck. It is dragging them close.\n\nWyvern and Bomber crash together through the canopy, and the Bomber is thrown loose; he lands alone, utterly winded. When he tries to move, he feels only an impossible tenderness, a wheezing pressure on his chest against which his strength simply evaporates.\n\nHe can smell burning. He breathes out in relief.

They throw great seed pods full of water at the base of the flame, but the Expeditionaries have swapped to slicks of oil and fat. The Soldier grins.

She’d always had a deft hand for the complex somatic stuff, the stuff that lets you bury the complexity of a ritual in a single, coded gesture. With the way my hands shake, that shit was never gonna work for me, but Cassie made it look easy. We strolled rather than marched through the palace, just gawked at these unfolding chambers of bizarre beauty: rooms where we fell upward, rooms that appeared to all the world as gardens open to the sky, though we knew we were deep underwater, of course.\nI followed her like a puppy, as I always have. We slowly unpeeled the layers of the Genie’s lair, room by room."
 verne.1015.d.1A2B:0 "My fault, of course. She wanted to go slower. Cassie wasn’t military, she didn’t have any experience with shit like this. And she was too fucking brave to be tomb raiding in the desert, too principled. You know how fucking crazy it is, that with no warning whatsoever, she almost beat a trap like that? That’s crazy fucking evocation, fighting against genie shit from however many centuries ago. And she almost beat it...\n\nI don’t remember what we did next, exactly. We just kept it moving. I was thinking about the leaves falling in the Vernissage gardens. I was thinking about the look in Cassie’s face, seeing someone in me who’d never fucking existed. A million years ago, knowing all I’d ever do is disappoint her."
 verne.1015.d.1B2B:0 "They were dumbasses, my Vernman guys, and I was a dumbass thinking they could work their way through that place. They’d have been better just charging through as a unit, working off instinct - instead they got picked off by traps one by one, trapped in sensory deprivation rooms screaming themselves hoarse, confused by illusions of beautiful gardens, led right into gas traps. Or they’d misjudge some weird fuckin’ gravity loop and crush themselves against walls.\n\nIn the end, it was just me and two other guys, and I’m rubbing my head thinking how the hell we’re gonna get out of here. At times like that, you’ve just gotta do it with the hangover. They’d sent me out here all too happy with the prospect of my violent death, that much was obvious."
 verne.1015.d.1B2C:0 "They were dumbasses, my Vernman guys, blockheads out the Expeditionaries, you know? No good telling them to decipher some fuckin’ wall pattern, they needed me to trust them. So I told them to be Vernmen, and I drove ‘em forward, and we got through. We lost a couple, to a weird fuckin’ gravity room and some illusion garden that led my guy right into a gas trap, but by the end of it these guys were pumped, I could see it. They’d done it; they’d die for me. Guys like that are crazy – the more you ask of ‘em, the more they like you."
 verne.1015.d.1C2B:0 "I left my elves to it. I figured they didn’t need me there, exhorting them to blockhead their way through eight and twenty puzzles the way a Vernman gang would’ve. Besides, I was exhausted by the press of magic, and I needed to think. They lost one guy to some strange room of staircases, ever receding and never quite making sense - I think the key to the room must have been conviction, straightforward attack. But their approach worked. After a couple of days, even an idiot like me could feel the lines they created with their careful movements, the overlapping fields of fire."

Truly, I had only been trying to make my archivist work sound interesting. His wedding was only six months out at this point, and I was intent on proving I was still worth being friends with. I wasn’t some loose end to awkwardly forget about, a rounding error who would disappear into a bookcase and out of his life. I hardly intended to risk his neck.\n\nIn fact, I was determined to preserve him in good condition for his fiancée, thus proving myself honourable and continuing a long tradition of mannerly pining. I know, I know - the best friend is a classic. But there’s fuck all else to do with your free time in a mage’s tower, and he was always totally crap at battle magic. I spent most of my teens guiding his wrists in just such a way as to make the somatic element of spells work... it’s like the Magisterium is aiming for tension.\n\nThis preamble is only to explain that when he came back to me, his eyes gleaming with some insane plan to sail off to Bulwar, I did not receive him enthusiastically. I told him that the fortress at Uelkiltrum was said to bristle with shit no mage had truly studied in a thousand years, and that if I got him killed, Clara would never forgive me. I told him that the Damerian ruins on the steep shores of the Šad Kuz were notoriously poorly preserved, and that they might crumble over our heads, even if what they contained didn’t try to kill us deliberately.\n\nAt which point he produced the fiancée, Clara, who after all was an Evoker in her own right, and who had a thirst for glory all her own.

After the Day of Ashen Skies, they rebuilt the place themselves and took to the ocean, plundering the East Diven under one and twenty masters before eventually proving too much of a nuisance to the Empress Jexis. Then they were dispersed among the locals, obsolete and irrelevant.\n\nI was finding it all terribly relatable. Emondo’s fiancée Clara was a wonderful woman, keen-eyed and interesting and with plenty of ideas of how we could make our way deep into the waterlogged ruins of Uelkiltrum. They were right together; they fit together. One could imagine them as hosts, as the gregarious petty nobility they were meant to be, charismatic and enviable. There was no place in their life for a strange, reedy little Eborthíli with a talent for translation. In short, I was sulking.\n\nAt the very least, we made good progress in the upper levels. I have learned that I focus well when I am morose, and Emondo and Clara were making quick work too, their garrulous conversation carrying through the halls. It didn’t help that we were a lean team, accompanied only by a small cadre of expeditionaries; I was confronted with them at all times, and found solace only in the treasures that even these uppermost floors seemed to promise.\n\nPervading everything was a strange sound, a distant keening like the cawing of a bird; yet we all understood, out of some instinct, that it was not quite natural."

Ideas about ancient Bulwaro-Damerian layout and architecture which had once been theoretical were now physical, real. I found myself doing the best work of my life, understanding the logic of this ancient place as though it were my own. I thought only of the strange, switchback labyrinths through which I trod, the recesses in the walls for which I could ascribe no specific purpose. As so often, the theoretical was a balm for the real.\n\nI did not have time to think about my petty loneliness, about Emondo’s future, about the life he would live which was complete without me. I remembered, for a perfect while, that I could possess a future of the mind, an existence no less real.\n\nWe arrived in a great chamber, in which the corpses of the dead had been arranged as if at council, six bodies seated in six stone thrones. Their heads had been replaced with those of animals – here a leopard, here a crane, here a horned bull. They wore all the finery of ancient Bulwar, their linens pristinely preserved. One could still make out the gorgeous threading at the hems, the symbols which, to my eye, looked almost priestly.

Instead I took my place behind a group of the elves, who by this point I believe had clocked the entire situation and were determined to distract me from my lovesickness. They told me of a system of exploration which was most frequently deployed for ruins like this, a sort of skeleton pattern observed by builders long before the elves arrived.\n\nBy the work of the moon, one could direct oneself, and the rangers’ choice of expedition date was suddenly justified.

Oh, the elves helped, of course – they were historically-minded enough to heed me when I told them they were ‘not to tear!’, my own voice reedy in the strange acoustics of this stale chamber.\n\nI was weaving between them as a dancer. I had studied these things, you see. While Emondo and Clara had trysted in the shady places of the Vernissage Park, I had pored over counterspells and ancient principles of magic, on rare accounts of the exorcism of such beings. I fought with a cold fury, with all the misery of one left behind. I had read that the Erragal despises its fate, shackled to a human corpse which will never decay... perhaps this goes some way to explain the rush of relief I felt, stark and pure, as I gently but firmly prised apart the magic of their binding.\n\nIn the wake of battle, all was quiet. We had prevailed – without a single death! – and it should have been a time for celebration. In the immediate aftermath we moved above ground, finding a dry place in the upper ruins to establish our office, ahead of the excavation that would soon begin.\n\nIt was then that Emondo found me, poring over my notebooks. I could not quite look at him.\n\n“You’ve been distant,” he said.\n“Have I?” I replied. I was unconvincing.\n“She annoys you?” Emondo tried, but I shook my head.\n“She’s... ideal,” I said. “I don’t disapprove.”\n\nI stared at him. I knew he wanted something from me, something I could not give. This was a familiar theme of our friendship, in all directions.\n\n“I’m going to be fine about it,” I said, slowly. Emondo nodded, and I felt sudden dismay – it was the nod of a man who understood. Who knew how I felt, and was being terribly gentle about it, who was extending me mercy. Had he always known? Had I always been the beneficiary of a mortifying kindness?\n\n“This is going to make you famous,” Emondo said, slowly. “You were a fucking archmage back there.”\n\nI stared.

We had prevailed – without a single death! – and it should have been a time for celebration. In the immediate aftermath we moved above ground, finding a dry place in the upper ruins to establish our office, ahead of the excavation that would soon begin.\n\nIt was then that Emondo found me, poring over my notebooks. I could not quite look at him.\n\n“You’ve been distant,” he said.\n“Have I?” I replied. I was unconvincing.\n“She annoys you?” Emondo tried, but I shook my head.\n“She’s... ideal,” I said. “I don’t disapprove.”\n\nI stared at him. I knew he wanted something from me, something I could not give. This was a familiar theme of our friendship, in all directions.\n\n“I’m going to be fine about it,” I said, slowly. Emondo nodded, and I felt sudden dismay – it was the nod of a man who understood. Who knew how I felt, and was being terribly gentle about it, who was extending me mercy. Had he always known? Had I always been the beneficiary of a mortifying kindness?\n\n“This is going to make you famous,” Emondo said, slowly. “You were a fucking archmage back there.”\n\nI stared.

She responded to all of these names, and knew that they usually meant Food, or the rush of Food-Giver hoisting her in the air with her firm claws, where Kaska could see much more than usual. Sometimes Food-Giver would place Kaska on her lap and squeeze, and this was very pleasant. But the world called! She felt bad for Food-Giver, but truthfully Kaska could find Food anywhere, and since she had planted one foot ahead of the other, she had seen more than she could ever have imagined.\n\nTake, for example, these strange, spiked fellows. In most ways they were much fleshier than Food-Giver or indeed Kaska herself; they were a lot like the Smooth And Grumpies Kaska had been avoiding on her great journey. They had strange, waxy face-spikes formed from their froth, and Kaska found this most curious. They brought with them huge boxes and sacks which leaked their sort of Food - hardly the best stuff, but nourishing enough. Kaska sampled a little, and then went to the nearby stream for a drink.\n\nThat evening, Kaska discovered two more things about the Waxy Spikes; they could not see snakes, and they loved Shiny Things almost as much as she did. She made concerned noises as the Waxy Spikes shouted into the night, their friend writhing on the ground and eventually going still. She irritably stepped on the snake’s neck until it was dead. They gave her more Food for that, and she went to explore the Old Rocks nearby.\n\nThe next morning, waking from her little alcove in the Old Rocks, she watched the Waxy Spikes pass her.

It’s not just the spices, nor the strange customs of these myriad halflings. It isn't the mountainous jungle either, nor is it strange beasts that prowl the land. All these things and more would be a regular irregularity for we Vernmen: a sense of wonder and discovery is all a right-thinking Vernman could dream of.\n\nNo, what's strange about Fahvanosy, is that this is the one place an old sea dog like me could call home. The Sea.\nShe seems... different... smells different. She puts the men at unease, like she’s always watching us. Not through the eyes of the strange merfolk, swimming in the upper twilight of the sea. Now she watches me, from deep down below, whom once lulled me so sweetly to sleep, now forces me into oblivion, eyes watching over me like some vigil, only to watch me still as I awake.\n\nI fear she even watches me in my dreams.\n\nIt was yet another night of restless sleep, eyes half open staring back at my eternal vigil, when Jændur Hildrsdöttir came to me with a shaking spiceling, a diver by trade. He was diving for pearls when he ventured too far away from the normal beds, said he could “hear the black pearl sing.”\nJændur told me she found him making a ‘barrier of pearls’ on the beach, and that when she questioned what he was doing, it was like a trance was broken, the spiceling falling to the ground, crying that the legends were true, that the Sea was watching him.\n\nI confess I wished to forget it all and sail back to my beloved Heartspier – but what is bravery, if not overcoming your fear? So we got to work. Called in a few favours from an old Tungric merchant. We bought a few of their mechanical “diving suits” as they called them, paid a premium too just to have them lengthened, greedy bastard.\n\nAnd when our boots finally touched the seabed, Jændur tore at her suit in some claustrophobic fury as the water closed in around her. I couldn't bear myself to blame her, a proud Harpy used to soaring the skies now forced to walk beneath the waves. None the less we still needed a good scout.”"

The silt clung to our legs, darkness embraced us all around, spells and flares all but stayed the encroaching darkness, while curious creatures of the depths poked their heads through the strange lights penetrating their sanctum. Even the Merfolk seemed to be hesitant to profane the sanctity of the darkness below; we lost any sign of their presence. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so anxious as the moment I breached the twilight into midnight, nothing but a waxed cloth tube reinforced with mithril supplying me with air, vanishing into a point unseen above me.\n\nCommunication down there was also nigh impossible, limited to handsigns and the occasional flash of mindspeech from our wizard. Even standing shoulder to shoulder, I felt isolated. Just the void. The void, and that creeping feeling of being watched by something. The Deep. The Pearl. The gaping maw of the void staring right into me.\n\nAfter what felt like days, we found something. I.. I have heard stories of grand battles. Trench lines around castles protecting against the hail of arrow and fireball alike. I have seen battlefields, picked the coin from friend and foe alike, sprawled in clusters side by side, thousands dead. Nothing, next to this.\n\nIt started with a crunch. Like a dry twig snapping underfoot. But with each step it continued, the detritus covering thousands of small brittle bones. What I had taken for coral was bone, trailing algae in vine-like hangings. A reef resembled a skull, now hollowed out for whatever life sustained itself. And as we walked further, rusty spears with flayed banners lurched from the darkness, bearing heraldry none of us had seen before. At one point I almost fell into a chasm, its flanks lined with jagged teeth pointed toward each other. My weight dislodged one, and I watched it slowly drift down through the long dead things intestines.\n\nFilipé was not so lucky.. As we got further in, a large rift appeared in front of us, its sides continually widening, till even a giant of myth would feel tiny. We all knew at once, somehow. Trench lines, marked at the edge in fluorescent, barbed seaweed. A small slit ran from each line to the next. Filipé approached a little too hastily, and a malign current took hold of him, dragging him. He turned to us, grasping at bony protrusions in the silt, each snapping soundlessly in his grip. Even as blood began to stain the water where he had gripped the seaweed, nothing could be heard – only bubbles escaping to the surface.

Maybe.\n\nGods above, I just hope my prayers go answered. This is not how a Vernman should die, leagues under the sea. Even as I sit here, enchanted book in hand, writing at the edge... We shouldn't have come here. There is that which should not be known, should not be found! I think I can hear drums. Drums echoing in my head. Maybe it’s my heart.. But somehow I know it’s not. Like a bell tolling to ward off the living: ‘stay away’. You don’t need to understand what it means, only feel it. This is a graveyard. Our graveyard. A final stretch across hell, a perverse Ruined Sea within a Ruined Sea, where all you ask is: what's at the center?\n\nWill there be some eons-dead god, some ancient Castellos?

We cannot go, but this person, whom we have barely talked to this entire journey, seems almost too eager to go. But I believe its for the best. The edge of this crater; it is lined with what I can only describe as teeth.. A giant maw, ready to swallow whomever enters. So for once, I’m swallowing my pride: as a Vernman, as a captain. This place is not for me. This is the one line I must not cross. My mustache is tingling, has been this entire time. Should have listened.\n\nAnd so we waited. Used the time to rest. One day. Two days. Then the third. Nothing.\n\nThen the fourth day came. And with it came a light. A red distant light. Small, at first, barely noticeable. Before it was joined by more. A ring of red lights, swimming above where I assume the lizardman was. So far, both out and down. As far out as there is to the pearls from heartspier, and as far down as there must be from the top of the Khenak mountains to Verne.. And still we saw the red lights dancing, hovering, before suddenly the earth shook, our first sound for days, the maw’s teeth crumbling gently into the endless waters below.\n\nSilence again. Every heartbeat, every breath, stopped in fear and awe, as the gaping maw in front of us cracked in twain with a hollow thud, down, down the middle. Castellos, Adean, Corin, any god above whoever they may be... Down here none of them could reign. Instead, what rose from the floor, from the crack in the maw... A god made flesh.\n\nStone wings broke through the mantle first, unfurling themselves across the span of the maw, tip to tip reaching edge to edge. Its feathers dripped oily stone, as the head pressed forth from the mantle... It – some snout, some skull, some awful face - pressed itself towards me, one eye empty and bleeding. looking into me, before it... spoke? Spoke into my head, pressed it’s thoughts onto my own, pushing me into the furthest socket in the back of my being. My body was spasming, yet all the while it spoke to me, with my own head, my own brain, pushing me further down: §P“That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange Eons even death may die”§!\n\nI came to once again on the ship. My crew, gone. My party, gone. All save for a lone Lizardman, looking over me. It handed me a strange black orb, bowing its head. Before it left, it spoke one word to me, barely decipherable in its hissing voice."

He guided me back from, pointing out small piles of buried gems with the ease of one who had buried them there himself. I believe I have regained control of my of my hand, my pen. Looking back, I'm not even sure I was ever ‘possessed’. It could just as well have been the isolation that got to me, my own subconscious fears.

We thought it would do what any other spirit vase should do... put a limit, draw a boundary.

Well, my superiors wanted a piece of the pie, and I am... how did you put it? A back-alley thug, when it comes down to it. That’s why I’m so very good at this sort of procurement.\n\nI keep small offices everywhere, you see, and truly, much of my work really is in import-export. I make a lovely trade bringing the oddities of the world back to Verne for the parlour-enjoying classes, and sometimes the government asks me to get something done, and if the price is right, sometimes I do it.\n\nIn this case, it was working out how to stage so great a distraction that the team I’d cobbled together could slip quietly past all those dreadfully stout guards. Most of the team were Binhrung themselves, even, which goes to show that national pride rarely trumps a love of money.\n\nAnyway, that’s how I landed on such a ridiculous spectacle.

Still, we were through the shell, and the team enjoyed my effusive praise as they ascended the staircases to the upper floors of the temple. A rumbling pervaded the entire structure, which seemed as good a reason as any to get out.\n\nThere they were faced with a strange sight - the countless automaton defenders of the temple, constructs hewn from gemstones – ruby, diamond, sapphire, tourmaline – moving about the place yet ignoring the team entirely. It took us a few moments to understand that it must be the gem we held, the heart of this place.\n\nI heard the muttering; Binhrung is my sixth language, but I have heard much of it since I moved out here. They were considering the value of the constructs – weighing the taboo of dismantling such ancient queenly artifacts for their own material benefit.

My heart drops slightly seeing them. The Paladin looks like he's from an Adeanic Order centering around combat and the ranger is a Huntress right out of a Deepwoods military school. The two swordsmen seem like veterans. They’ve caught us in their kill zone.\n\n“Vernemen, aye? Odd, your animal is a Wyvern but you’re slower than Kobolds!” The Paladin laughs, drawing his warhammer. “So what’ll this be?”\n\nMy eyes travel up his armor to his own, but stray to the right, noticing two armored winged humanoids around the back of a hill, exactly where they should be.

 verne.1050.d.1A:0 "BOOM, and the walls crashed in. Taychendi guards snapped around to look– then an instant later, a lightning quick kobold was dancing between them, rapier in hand, swish and slash and bravado-bursting. Then a white coated human, hand-axe and sabre in hand, demonic– rending, hacking, reaver-tomahawk flying. A yell, a scream, a hew and cry. Then back-up pistol blasting. The rest of the party surged in. A mage woman, Damerian, pink-haired and flinging fire. A rogue-ranger of far Eordand, arcing arrows. More fight – then calm. The dust and the smoke cleared, and blood and bodies remained. Alec síl Arcavar sighed, smirking, as he pulled his hand-axe from an elven face. “Well... can’t say it didn’t work.”\n\nThe citadel was deep in Nanru Nakar’s undercity. Even though there wasn’t really an “outside” to speak of, the magically reinforced, heavily guarded entrances made good on that “fortress” description well enough. On the inside, it was like a palace – the grey, weathered smooth stone of most Precursor ruins was white-washed, clean. Every inch of the place was stocked to the brim with supplies and provisions of all kinds... and treasure. Lots of it. Corinato harumphed as he took in the sights. Precursor relics, priceless pieces of artwork, golden jewellery and ancient heirlooms. “This must be a dream of yours, Pearlsedger! Riches beyond imagining!”\n\nAlec síl Arcavar chuckled, as he hefted a Precursor spellblade from the wall. “Oh... yes it is...!” Then he twirled, flashed the spellblade, threw his old one to the ground. “But my, Corinato, don’t tell me your little kobold heart isn’t racing right now?!” The red-scaled fencer snarled, whipped his sabre around in a gesture of offence. “The difference between us, Vernman, is that we Pearlsedgers actually NEED the money. Have you been to the Pearlywine lately? Dismal affair, really... people leaving, towns in disrepair. You mustachio’d freaks hogged all the adventure!”\n\n“How terrible...” The Damerian mage said, mischievously. “They even stole your baldness...”\nAlec scoffed, tipped his tricorn, ran a hand quick over his close-cropped blonde hair. “I couldn’t be the BLOND BANDIT if I was bald, now– COULD I–?!”\n“Now now, reaver–” Corinato pointed his rapier deeper into the citadel, maw turned to grin. “Let’s focus on the adventure, hmm?” I think...”"
 verne.1050.d.1B:0 "The party watched one of the entrances to the hidden fortress. Their infiltrator – an Eordan rogue, currently glamoured by their party-mage, a pink-haired Damerian woman – returned from his saunter up to the gate. The guards had been knocked out, hidden behind a corner. “All good now,” he said. “It’s clear inside too – we shouldn’t have any problems.”\nCorinato nodded, turned to his Pearlsedger counterpart, who looked disappointed he hadn’t gotten in on the action. “See? Told you it would work. Let’s go.”\n\nThe citadel was deep in Nanru Nakar’s undercity.

 verne.1050.d.1C:0 "Alec tapped the shimmering, smooth-stone wall – watched as the arcane ward flickered in response. They were situated near a shaft heading deeper into the undercity – one that happened to now be home to a raging waterfall. The sound was great enough to preclude talking, so Alec merely gave a nod, then pulled out the Korashi drill they’d carried. Their party mage, a pink-haired Damerian, recoiled at its presence – had to excuse herself. Corinato and their party rogue, an Eordan ranger, just watched his work in silence. The ward’s shimmer dissipated instantly as the drill touched it – an impenetrable defence, instantly nullified. Eventually, after a few hours of drilling, they broke through. Undetected.\n\nThe citadel was deep in Nanru Nakar’s undercity.

 verne.1051.d.2A:0 "Corinato leapt over his foe, nape-of-the-neck severing with a flash of his rapier. They were swarming– as if the Mudaliars had dragged their entire private army down to the depths! The Kobold turned to dive over a kick by another– then rolled out of the way as he fell, tomahawk embedded in his chest. “ALEC–!”\n“WHAT?!” A pistol blast signalled a spent back-up– the Pearlsedger just threw the spent gun at one of his enemies. “As you can see– KOBOLD– I’M TRYING–!” Parry– slash– a Taychendi staggered back into his friend. “NOT–!” A driven sabre-point – two speared– “TO–!” Then a back-hand blow from the side of a tomahawk, bodies falling. “DIE!”\n\nA fireball, an arrow, twirl and dash and scramble and slash! “This is the problem with you Pearlsdgers–!” Corinato barked, as he leapt up on the mage’s shoulders, parried a guard who had tried to attack her from behind. “All discipline talk-!” The Kobold broke his opponent’s guard– then rapier-tip speared through his forehead. Draw back– leap– twirling whirlwind slash. “But NO bravado!” Three more Taychendi fell. “NO STYLE!”\n\n“OH REALLY?!” The Blond Bandit grunted, picked up a sabre from the ground– charged three foes ahead of him. “BÓCIOT– ARROW, ON ME!” Then barreled through one– charging. Two sabres raised– then one fell, elf-shot piercing hand, another piercing head. Alec síl Arcavar parried the other with his sabre– “BECAUSE I THINK–” drove his hand-axe into the head of the enemy guard holding it. He stood, growled as three more guards surged into the hall– pulled out another tomahawk, picked up another Taychendi sabre. “--That YOU’RE missing something too!”\n\n“Oh?” Corinato glanced at the Vault Door at the end of the hall, that their mage was desperately trying to unlock. “And what’s that?!”\nAlec laughed wildly, drunk off battle. “It’s all...” Then he charged again– a storm of his own, flashing steel and reaver-iron. “ABOUT...!” Axe severed sword-hand – a piercing scream. “COLD!” A dodge, a kick, a quick-slash-and-sever – a head rolled. “HARD!” A parried blow, a fist-in-ripost, then a downward arc – and a wail, as axe-split-stomach. “CASH!”\n\n“HEY!” The mage called, frantic. “The party turned. “This door– NOT opening! Need something bigger!” Corinato grimaced."
 verne.1051.d.2B:0 "Corinato leapt over his foe, a flash of his rapier hacking at the nape of his neck. Their attempt at stealth had... not gone according to plan, to say the least. Thankfully, they were much fresher than they might have been. The Kobold turned to dive over a kick by another– then rolled out of the way as he fell, tomahawk embedded in his chest “CAREFUL–!”\n“Oh– I’m sorry!” A pistol blast signalled a spent back-up– the Pearlsedger just threw the spent gun at one of his enemies. “As you can see– KOBOLD– I’m trying to–!” Parry– slash– a Taychendi staggered back into his friend. “do–!” A driven sabre-point – two speared– “MY–!” Then a back-hand blow from the side of a tomahawk, bodies falling. “JOB!”\n\nA fireball, an arrow, twirl and dash and scramble and slash! “This is the problem with you Pearlsdgers–!” Corinato barked, as he leapt up on the mage’s shoulders, parried a guard who had tried to attack her from behind. “All discipline talk-!” The Kobold broke his opponent’s guard– then rapier-tip speared through his forehead.

Need something bigger!” Corinato grimaced."
 verne.1051.d.2C:0 "The party grimaced as they eyed the hallway before them. Rows upon rows of glowing magic-circles covered the floor and wards – rune traps, powered by a small damestear crystal at the far end, above the Vault Door. The crystal was protected itself by a lattice of steel. Alec turned to their Eordan ranger. “Can you make that shot?”\nThe ranger shrugged. String, draw, loose – the arrow struck the lattice. He tried again, again, again. The Ruinborn shook his head. “The lattice – the holes are big enough, technically... but its too far away. Even for me.”\n\nCorinato shook his head. “Unless our mage knows levitation magic...?” The Damerian shook her head. “I’ll have to make my way across, then! Strike it with my rapier.” The light-footed kobold began to edge his way through the maze of traps, dancing between them. “I bet you wish you could do as I do, Pearlsedger!” Corinato said, as he tip-talonned through the gaps, leaping and twirling over the magic triggers. “You lot– all discipline talk and brute strength– but NO bravado–!” The Vernman did a stunning, twisting flip over a rune. “NO–“ Then halted, silent still, as he found himself resting on the tip of his scaly finger. “--STYLE...?” Past that point, the runes were totally overlapping. An impasse.\n\nHe had to go back. It took him a while. Alec síl Arcavar chortled, grinning. “Style, hmmm...? Always with the braggadocio, the puffing up– spirit of adventure this, Corinite ideals that! One day, you’ll realise – the only thing to adventuring is cold, hard cash. Do what you want, take what you want.”\nCorinato finally found his way back. “Oh? And tell me – what is YOUR brilliant plan for dealing with our predicament, then?”\n– –\nSpin– spin– THROW! The kobold flew through the hallway, flying, flying, straight as an arrow– rapier-tip out. The other party members held their breaths – then let the anticipation out, as Corinato’s sword-point struck between the lattice. The crystal shattered – and the runes deactivated before he hit the floor. Alec came up running, grinning even wider than before. “Well well well... you were saying? Now what’s with this door, then?”\n\nThe mage grimaced. “Looks like its protected by heavy warding... I’ll try my best, but–” Corinato stood, dusted himself off, and interjected with a wave."

 verne.1052.d:0 "The vault was gigantic, lined with every treasure the Mudaliars wouldn’t countenance losing. Even still, one stood above the rest – at the centrepiece of the room was a suit of resplendent, shimmering Precursor Armour. Corinato approached the piece, in awe – at the base, it read “War-Armour of Liandarha Mudaliar.” The Tacenie Precursor noble that had founded the Mudaliar dynasty, so soon after the Ruin.\n\nBut it was too good to be true. Corinato turned to a commotion behind him – only to see Alec síl Arcavar standing at the entrance, a fire-eyed Mudaliar woman by his side. And twenty guards behind him. Someone had given him a wine-glass. “Corinato... Corinato... oh my dear friend...”\n\n“Traitor!” The kobold growled, as he flashed his rapier.\n\n“Now now... I didn’t lie, when I said I was cutting you in to my score...!” the Blond Bandit flashed a grin, raised his glass. “I did lie about the rest, though.” He took a sip. “You see, that adventuring party DID find this place – and died raiding it! But oh, they sent that letter beforehand... I was hired to tie up the loose end.” He gestured to the trophy room. “They want me to capture you alive, send you back with an enchantment-induced fable to give to the Viceroy– with just enough reality to fool any arcane-eyes. You know how it is – ‘oh, there’s nothing there, just an empty storeroom!’” Corinato snarled. “Oh, don’t look like that– take in the relics, before you surrender!” He gave his paramour a grin. “In the mean-time, I’ll be getting a little more acquainted with my employers...” He looked back – toasted again. “So long, Corinato! Till we meet again!”\n\nAlec left with his Mudaliar lover, the Vault door shutting behind him. They could still open it from this side, but... Corinato’s party looked to him, desperate. He couldn’t bear it – he turned away... right back at the Precursor armour.\n– – –\n“Well... it fits.” The mage was trembling, as she gripped Corinato’s rapier, clad head-to-toe in the Armour of Liandarha. The Eordan ranger stood by her side, holding a relic-bow. “Are you... sure this will work?” She turned to the kobold perched on her back – claws gripping her upper arms, like strings to puppet. Hopefully. If she responded to his inputs.\nCorinato gave a nonchalant shrug. “Well... if it doesn’t– its not like we’ll know anyway!” The mage gave a nervous chuckle. “Are we ready?” Nods, grimaces. “Alright...”"

 verne.1053.d:0 "Three scrying-mirrors had been set up in the room – and two exceptionally comfy chairs in front of them. Ramujith was flicking through an old tome on trans-locational targeted polymorphing techniques when Jalinwathi, Archmage of Divination and bringer of long-exhausted snacks, suddenly spoke. “Look. They’re going in.”\n\nThe Vernmen had sent three, extremely well equipped adventurer teams for their “heist”. Clerics, mages, rogues, paladins, the works. Objective: unknown. Plan: unknown. But you couldn’t hide much from a magical institution that was probably older than Verne itself. The Blue House – comfortably ensconced in the towering, High-Temple-esque manor of a Precursor Slaver Noble at the heart of Nagar Vyechei – had mages of every variety focused on achieving glory-through-magic, on unraveling the secrets of the past. Wild experiments and artefacts of every quantity lay within its halls – chaos captured within its walls. Everyone in Andeios knew of their power. Few actually understood the depths of it. The Vernman preparations had been spotted from a mile away.\n\n“Through the temple-banks... mmm, as was predicted.” Ramujith scratched at his beard, shook his head. “Looks like someone will need to have a word with their counting masters... and I will need to sponsor one of Gelmarathos’ experiments.”\n\n“Hasn’t he been going on about this entangling this new-fangled artificery with– oh, well... would you look at that!” The Vernmen were in the banks now – being shown underground. The Vaults of Uyas Enret were situated in the great tunnels and storerooms beneath the Blue House itself. Long ago, the majority of them had been handed over to Nagar Vyechei’s merchant lords. A portion of them however, those which lay directly beneath the Blue-House itself, remained under the arcane institution’s control. It was possible to get from the merchant areas to the mages’ areas, but very difficult. Unless you had a trick up your sleeve, of course. “It looks like they’ve...”"

 verne.1054.d.1A:0 "An apprentice came in with a bowl of cashew nuts. Jalinwathi began to pick at them – and the two archmages watched as the banker led his “clients” through his paid-for section of the vaults and the mountains of gold he stored within. Forfeit after this venture, of course. As it turns out, letting the Vernmen take a stab at this “heist” of theirs had its advantages. But still, it was a disappointment seeing them get through so easily. The banker’s guards just nodded at their employer as a group of absurdly heavily armed, foreign adventurers sauntered past.\n\nRamujith had set down his tome – he had a plan of the vaults in his hands, now. “It is odd that they aren’t going for the gold, though, don’t you think? I always thought the Cannorians were all about money. Riches, you know – wealth beyond imagining. But eh, their relics fascination... they are almost as obsessed with the things as we are. Thank the gods we moved the important ones out. Well, most of them.”\n\nJalinwathi chuckled. “Yes... most of them. As in, all the ones we don’t have to pretend are important.” Silence, for a moment.\n\nRamujith spoke, turned to his counterpart, brow upturned slightly. “You don’t think they’re going for the dragon, do you?”\n\nAnother pause. Jalinwathi shook his head, smirked a little. “Wouldn’t that be a load off my mind...” Finally, the Vernmen reached the bottom of their co-conspirator’s vaults – right up against the wards that marked the entrance fo the Blue House’s section of Uyas Enret. They hadn’t been able to reinforce them – but still, there were some guards, one of them an apprentice on watch duty. “Is that a new recruit? Would love to see how much of a fight he puts up. If there was ever a time for a secret prodigy’s skills to show...”\n\nRamujith laughed. “Hah! Watch, I bet he will try something– insurmountable odds, let me use my secret special unique spell only I know! Remember the last one who tried that? I swear you saw it... in the duelling halls?” They were both grinning, now. “Come on now, apprentice! Show them the rage of Umathladududorus! Oh– the adventurers are moving– looks like they’re...”"

Quite a way to make an entrance, I must say.” Once the Vernmen were past the banks and into the Vaults themselves, their “protection” quickly ran out. The scaly-squirrel had not helped them. They were fighting hall by hall, now, slowly cutting their way through the Vaults, and taking casualties all the while. “Guards are putting up a fight, though! Colour me impressed.”\n\nRamujith had set down his tome – he had a plan of the vaults in his hands, now. “It is odd that they aren’t going for the gold, though, don’t you think?

Their mages could probably break the wards, sure – the mages and fighter-guards in front of them would be a slightly tougher roadblock. The Vernmen noticed them – stopped a little bit before them, discussed their options in hushed whispers. Jalinwathi raised an eyebrow. “I wonder how much of a show the apprentices will put up. These are new recruits, right? Disposable? Would love to see how much of a fight they put up. If there was ever a time for a secret prodigy’s skills to show...”\n\nRamujith laughed. “Hah!

 verne.1055.d.2AB:0 "The room was full of mages now, from high ranking mages to chattering apprentices, all watching the mirrors – or listening to Ramujith. “You wouldn’t believe it! He started screaming– well, like a strained scream, right? And he turned– seriously– he turned himself into a JAGUAR. Perfect polymorph, on the fly! FEEEEEEEL THE WRATH OF THE CHENDHYA! And he wasn’t even Chendhyan! I mean– I was on the floor– it was brilliant! What, a statue? Well– he’s probably in Dhivumanhu right now– and I didn’t see his face before he lost it– so–”\n\nJalinwathi turned around to his gossipping partner, smacked him on the back. “Oh enough, Ramu! I know he was impressive, but the REAL show is on right now!” The Blue House’s Challúmaton Dragon – a colossal undead golem of bone-white metal, fuelled with the slurry-soup of untold thousands of souls – was tearing the Vernmen apart. A mockery of dragonkind, but the masterwork of the Slaver-Nobles. No blood to spill, no scales to dislodge. You could only hope to dismember it and separate the parts before it pieced itself back together, or exorcise the restless dead within. Not enough space for the former – and it looked like the Vernmen would die before they figured out the latter.\n\nThe crowd of mages watched intently, excitedly chatting about the battle occurring before them.

We tried to control it with genie relics the other day. Just nothing. No reaction, not even exciting.” Another Vernman reached down to grab the head – and found his arm bitten clean off by it’s maw. A gasp, as the dragon’s headless body swept the adventurers away and socketed its head back in its neck. “A weapon like no other– and its sat in our vaults for 1500 years, an uncontrollable hunk of metal! Just infuriating...!”\n\nThe scene on the mirrors caught Jalinwathi’s eye again – the Vernmen were restrategizing. Their clerics formed a line, chanted a spell. For a second, concern flashed across Jalinwathi’s face – but then a giddy hope rose in his heart. ”By the gods– they might actually– it looks like they’re...!”"

The squirrel turned into– into a Wyvern! The others broke on sight– but the apprentice?! KADRADAR, HEAR THE CALL OF YOUR DISTANT DESCENDANT! And BAM! Yeah– THAT Kadradar! Supercharged him! An intercession, for this elf, on this day! His penance? Well, he was sort of grappling with the wyvern– led him right to the dragon’s chamber. It um... crushed them both! But hey, giving your life isn’t so–”\n\nJalinwathi turned around to his gossipping partner, smacked him on the back. “Oh enough, Ramu! I know he was impressive, but the REAL show is on right now!” The Blue House’s Challúmaton Dragon – a colossal undead golem of bone-white metal, fuelled with the slurry-soup of untold thousands of souls – was tearing the Vernmen apart. A mockery of dragonkind, but the masterwork of the Slaver-Nobles. No blood to spill, no scales to dislodge. You could only hope to dismember it and separate the parts before it pieced itself back together, or exorcise the restless dead within. Not enough space for the former – and it looked like the Vernmen would die before they figured out the latter.\n\nThe crowd of mages watched intently, excitedly chatting about the battle occurring before them.

The Vernmen had packed their bodies together, hidden behind anything they could use to guard against the dragon’s blows. An aide from the mages, a cry of “TOGETHER NOW!” and “HOLD FAST!”, and the battering strikes of the Challúmaton golem’s claws, tail, wing, had been beaten back. Some of the Vernmen had fallen victim to it – been grabbed from the line, flung away, slammed against walls – but the adventurers gritted their teeth, closed ranks, and readied for the next blow. It worked. It cost them dearly, but it worked. The clerics had completed their spell – exorcised the spectres within the dragon’s bone-white frame. The Challúmaton lay lifeless on the chamber floor. Well, more lifeless than it already was, being undead and all.\n\nRamujith had been glued to his seat as he watched the Vernmen’s victory – saw 1500 years of work evaporate in an instant.

They didn’t know it, at first. But they did. For the archmage could contain his pure, unadulterated happiness no longer. “FREEEEEEEEDOM! I’M FREE!

We were never getting anywhere anyway.”\n\nThe two archmages turned back to the scrying mirrors – an army of guards had rushed in now. The Vernmen held their hands up, thoroughly, inescapably caught. Captured. “So,” Ramujith said. “What happens now? Its just a hunk of dead metal, now.”\n\nHis colleague simply shrugged. “Well... we both have projects we need to fund, right?”"

Their name derives from their idiosyncratic L-shapes, at the time a controversial deviation from Cannor’s favoured symmetry; though of course the wings observe symmetry with one another.\n§Y-----------------------------------------------------------------§!\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_tour_of_halann_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_corins_fall_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_mural_of_castellos_replica_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_akasi_relic_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_amadia_pearl_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_challumaton_bones_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_nanru_nakar_relic_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_kheios_relic_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_chien_binhrung_temple_heart_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_tlagapatung_spirit_vase_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_fahvanosy_orb_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_horashesh_sundial_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_effelai_heart_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_holohana_footprint_loc]\n[Root.Owner.vernissage_verne_halann_pledge_loc]"

 verne_vernissage_tier3_desc:0 "The construction of the Expositionary Halls marks the point at which the Vernissage becomes as much complex as park. Rather than adding another distinct edifice to this place, the Halls are constructed at various beautiful points of the Vernissage Park, offering specific views from their terraces or else hiding, shy, within dappled glades.

 verne_vernissage_tier4_desc:0 "With the construction of the Grand Galerie, the southern end of the Vernissage suddenly narrows towards a point of glory, the main entry for the entire complex. This enormous building dominates almost two-thirds of the length of the park itself, designed to be experienced in a grand loop beginning and ending at the immense centre foyer. From there, one may peruse Alvar’s Pavilion for temporary exhibitions, enjoy the Sarhaly exhibits which have now entirely taken over the Bronze Wings, or else peruse the Expositionary Halls for thoughtful collections curated on specific themes. One may of course abandon the intellectual entirely, wandering instead among the carefully tended water gardens which have replaced the boxy hedgeways of old, gossiping and enjoying one’s lunch.
