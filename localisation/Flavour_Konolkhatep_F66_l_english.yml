 konolkhatep_gnoll_dynamic_mission_title:0 "Our Tribe"
 konolkhatep_gnoll_dynamic_mission_desc:0 "The demon’s maw, the reforged spirit, the fallen sun’s light—whatever our prophetic beginnings, we now stand at the Sorrow’s crossroads. Our pack has fought wars and brokered peace, lashed lessers and loved equals, traded with and tyrannised neighbours and foes alike. Yet amid our long travails, we have done something thought no more than a dream for gnolls throughout history: subsuming the great Kheterata. Not merely subjugating its Crodamic dynasty, demanding tribute from its cat-loving priests, or cowing the humans within, we stand on the Sorrow’s banks...and call it home. As the flames of war dampen to an ashy calm, the question swells in our minds like the river before us: What kind of home will it be?"

 konolkhatep_compromise_dragons_desc:0 "Everyone knows that the Ahati hate two things above all: foreign conquerors and gnolls. Indeed, these noble military and mercantile brotherhoods have been our staunchest opposition since we established our rule over the Sorrow. They pray for the day their draconic god burns our pelts to ashes, and human rule is restored in the Sorrow. Suffice to say, that is not happening. For the shared prosperity of Kheterata, we must cooperate and put old quarrels aside. Surely we could make these compromises easier to swallow if we grant them some concessions and help develop their mercantile infrastructure."

A powerful and fearsome wizard, she unified the many minor Sandfang packs of the Sur mountains and became a nightmare for the Bulwari. Her realm and her legacy will soon be cleaved in return, however, as our glorious legions march into Bulwar. Gnollkind will rule these lands indeed, but only under the righteous stewardship of Konolkhatep!"

 konolkhatep_pierce_devourer_desc_1:0 "The despicable and egotistical nightmare of a warlord that fashioned himself Zokka Devourer-of-Suns was the embodiment of all the evils that torment gnollkind. Not content with the great magical talent he was blessed with, he turned to demons to increase his power instead. Thousands and thousands of Bulwari perished at his pyres, and so brutal was his rule that even some among his own line deserted him, lured away by the lies of dead sun gods. But the sun of Konolkhatep is not dead, and the heirs of Zokka will burn their jaws trying to devour it. Let us put down his monstrous legacy once and for all!"

In the past, gnolls ruled these fertile lands, but instead of turning them into their homeland they razed and burned them, all in pursuit of the fleeting and cursed power offered by demons. No longer are we blinded by hellfire and charged with the chains of demonkind. The Sorrow, Kheterata, these blessed lands, they are our home now. From here, we will build a brighter future for gnollkind!"

Among the most fervent Xhazobkultists of Halann, these gnolls foolishly believe that the wretched powers their demonic masters grant them make them invincible! Grizaka already proved this to be a lie when she slayed Viakkoc X, but their accursed dynasty continues tormenting the seas of Halann: seas that now belong to us.

With it, they seized legions of Krah from the barbaric Cannorian tribes, and put them to good use building magnificent works in the Mother’s Sorrow. Those days are long past, and the fleet of the Kheterata we conquered was nothing more than a bunch of rotting carcasses. Those that they once raided now pride themselves on chartering the largest fleets in Halann, confident that they make them untouchable. Well, not anymore! We will rebuild the dreaded fleet of Kheterata, greater than ever before, and the seas will bend to our will!"

The greatest works of both mankind and gnollkind have been built with the sweat, blood and tears of thousands and thousands of slaves. If we wish to build a glorious and prosperous empire, we will need to provide our economy with a significant supply of Krah. Luckily, with our new magnificent fleet, and the expertise of the recently absorbed Seascourge Gnolls, it should be child’s play to seize legions of servants from the unprotected shores of Bulwar."

One of the first human civilizations, it has also been the proudest and greatest their kind has ever forged. While they might no longer rule the Sorrow, they have as much of a right to live and prosper in it as we do. We must convince them of our good intentions, erasing the image of gnolls as monstrous enslavers and demon worshippers. Gnolls and humans will build a better Kheterata; united we are strong!"

A bringer of civilization, not a rampaging horde of savages. A land of unity and prosperity, not of suffering and demons. Gnollkind is finally free from the chains of the Xhazobkult and the Kvangahga, and the humans of Kheterata have too been freed from both the oppression of the raids and the ignominy that their foolish rulers had sunk them into. All Khetists in Halann, Nirakhetist and Elikhetist alike, rejoice at the glorious rise of Konolkhatep! Kheterata has been freed, and soon, all of Halann will be too!"

She claimed the title of Empress-of-Gnollkind to signify her wish to unify our kin under her rule. But there can only be one Emperor of gnollkind, and we will prove her line unworthy of such a mantle. They might have been closer to enlightenment than most gnollish, but Gnollakaz's failure to bow down to our blessed empire proves they are no better than the rest. Crush them under our heels!"

She split between her spawn the realm she has forged by crushing the sun worshippers of Dasmazar. Zykari made Kogzalla a pack of ferocious hunters with a great love for spice. Khazet turned Koggrafa into a realm of traders obsessed with material wealth. If these small sister packs have managed to survive is mostly thanks to their talent in switching sides when convenient. The luck of these twin realms has, however, definitively run out. We will crush them both under our heel, and seize their riches and talents for ourselves.

The people teem with burning pride as the resurgent Empire of the Khet, shepherded by the unquestioned and irrefutable Neverkaar, claim righteous dominion over human, gnoll, and all who seek the Sorrow’s everflowing bounty. Prosperity looms on the horizon, and so long as Neverkaar and his fellow gnolls reign as they are, war and calamity can never call to Kheterata ever again."

Stillness pervades the scarred sands and innumerable battlefields of the dead, and across Kheterata, the putrid green flames of the Xhazobkult’s great revelry simmers and dies.\n\nAs Neverkaar—no, as Horutep glances at his soot-covered prosthetic, he peers past his gilded fingers to his gnoll and human faithful as they pray to his solar visage. Pausing for a moment, he shuts his eyes before turning his nose to the horizon. Breathing deeply, he commands the warding wind around him to calm, and as he exhales, he opens his eyes to greet the gentle copper light creeping over the horizon.\n\nA new dawn, a new era: one shaped by Horutep."

And now, those mortals happen to be us, the new Stewards of the Sorrow. We are bound to these divine beings as they are bound to the Mother’s Sorrow, so ensuring their approval is paramount to the continued existence of our new empire.

The Priest-Smith turned pack lord took this title because of a mighty genie relic he had discovered, a magical warhammer capable of shaping and enchanting metal. The fierce faith of these smiths would be admirable, if it wasn’t so terribly misguided. These zealots will soon find that no hammer, magical or not, can stop the march of our glorious armies. Let us end their primitive superstitions and vanquish their false goddess. We will shatter their hammer and their faith!"

The ancient and venerable Kheteratan culture has thousands of new members, as more and more gnolls abandon their backwards and barbaric traditions to join the pinnacle of civilization!

Their founder, Ozyn, the so-called Seeker-of-Secrets, was a mere assassin, misusing his Planetouched powers for coin. Only with a shameful chain of betrayals and treacheries did he become pack lord, or Zuultan, as the egotistical wretch and his line took to calling themselves. The gnolls of Tzilekal might fashion themselves heir to the genies, but in reality they are just weaklings playing with powers they do not understand. Once we have crushed their pretensions and delusions, their relics will finally be in the proper hands –ours, of course."

 konolkhatep_watchful_eyes_desc:0 "The Ahati might tolerate our presence for now, but it would be foolish to believe that this means we can trust them, or that they trust us in return. Many Kheteratan kings made this mistake before, and paid for it with a sword in their guts. Their reticence to accept a gnollish Steward is no secret, and until we can guarantee their loyalty is absolute, we cannot give them the slightest space to conspire and scheme. A thousand watchful eyes must follow the Ahati at all times. The loyalists in their ranks will be rewarded, and the would-be-traitors punished. Only that way can we ensure the stability of the realm while simultaneously taking advantage of their many abilities."

 konolkhatep_seal_pact_desc:0 "It took some time for the Ahati to believe that we were actually seeking the good of Kheterata and its people, and not just pretending for some kind of vile scheme. But now, with our continued cooperation, the advancing assimilation of our people into Kheteratan culture, and our repeated victories in the battlefield surpassing anything recent human Stewards had achieved, we can finally say that they trust us. We cannot say that they will be forever loyal to our government, but at the very least they have come to see the Sorrowmane as integral members of Kheterata, and as such as perfectly valid candidates for Stewardship. Perhaps it is time, then, to consider something that was previously unthinkable. If a Gnoll can be a Steward, why wouldn’t gnolls be able to join the Ahati brotherhoods too?"

 konolkhatep_call_dragon_desc:0 "During the Dragonwake, the Bronze Lord scorched the Sorrows for years before donning his human guise to reign over the burned Kheterata (exposing the true dragon’s ability to polymorph to the world), and, still ornery and vainglorious, instigated the Kheteratan Dragon Wars, conquering vast swathes of Bulwar. Only after vanishing in battle against the Sand Demon of the Salahad did his meteoric reign come to an end. Millennia later, Aakhet’s faithful believe the dragon to be Elikhet incarnate and emulate his fiery tenets with unbridled zeal. Even when quarrelling like a bitter family, the sons and daughters of Elikhet and Nirakhet both agree that the Bronze Lord’s worshippers extol a warmongering foreigner too self-conceited to rule.\n\nTroubled by Aakhet’s lengthy history and unending procession of personas, Horutep prepares to handle the Bronze Lord’s meddlesome games—once and for all. Within Aakheta’s Bronze Dragon Academy, Kheterata’s newest Steward must secure Aakhet’s permission, or, at least, his indifference."

Within a few fiery years, Aakhet appeared, wounded Kheterata’s heartland, slew the reigning Khetarch, and then ruled the nation in his playful human guise. With pride and will in tragic measure, Aakhet marched into Bulwar, raining fire upon the sun worshippers before vanishing yet again after his inconclusive struggle against the Sand Demon of the Salahad. In his wake, the Bronze Lord earned mocking monikers: a light bringer bringing darkness.\n\nHorutep grins grimly, his rapport with the Bronze Lord revealing this murky leg of history. Although he lacked a draconic visage or fiery breath, his army’s path through Bulwar proved even more legendary. Now, the godly gnoll lords over the smoking rubble of the defiant. Fanatics and foes alike speak of the Steward’s tempestuous campaign, and from now unto the sun’s final blot, Horutep shall reign as master of Bulwar—a dragon in all but form."

 konolkhatep_raw_power_desc:0 "The Salahadesi Desert blankets history beneath its endless multicoloured sands. Yet even amid the forgotten dunes, genie remnants linger, looming large in contemporary imaginations. Capricious and magical, the air-aligned Djinn Sultanates ruled the lands that would become Kheterata for aeons, untouchable by mortal threat thanks to their extraplanar nature and overwhelming wish magics. It was only with Elikhet’s apotheosis that Kheterata arose against their godly powers. A looming threat thereafter, their grand banishment back to the elemental planes during the Dissipation, a byproduct of the Day of Ashen Skies, secured the Khet as undisputed rulers of the Salahad.\n\nHorutep flexes his dark-nailed hand, feeling power flow through his fingertips. No more a mere gnoll, he was a true Steward in mind, body, and spirit. With ongoing excavations unearthing valuable genie artefacts for his empowerment, he snorts with disarming relief: What worry would the genie’s wish magic, ever corrupting and overwhelming to simple mortals, pose to him?"

As Horutep, vigorous and wise, traces the Zatsarya’s star-lined stone with his sacred padded palm, he closes his eyes and dreams of eternity.\n\nHe (for who else could?) will fulfill the broken promises and betrayed prophecies of epochs past.

Massive underwater civilizations, merfolk, and sea demons alike were all alluded in the stories we had heard. Thus, when we actually arrived and brought the region into our control, we were surprised to see that all of these stories and more were true! The native Baashidi have traded and coexisted with the merfolk for ages and while unusual they pose a fine example for how we could benefit from such a relationship. A motherload of valuables await in this untapped market lying just below the surface. Fish, shells, unique inventions and most importantly of all Damestear are but a few of the goods we’ve seen sold in the elaborate merfolk underwater marketplaces. Our best diplomats have been sent to work with the local Baashidi and create a trade deal with some of these marvelous underwater civilizations. With Konolkhatep on land and the Merrfolk patrolling the seas, our dominion over all Sarhali commerce will be absolute."

 konolkhatep_words_past_desc:0 "When Elikhet guided the ancient Kheteratans away from the tyrannical Bulwari God-Kings in ages past, he shirked his divine solar mantle to reside with his persecuted people among the blasted dunes. When Nirakhet wept for her son’s humility, he comforted his mother, sanctioning her tears into the mighty river that defined Kheterata’s destiny. When invaders, whether djinn, Damerian, or even gnoll, sought his people’s subjugation, he roused from idleness or slumber to rout the affronting foe.\n\nAnd yet time and time again, his heritage has faltered beneath lapsing Khetarch guidance, or so Horutep tells himself. The gnoll, reciting his greatest feats and adjusting his finest vestments, readies a single message for the first of the Khet: the faith must be bolstered lest history be repeated."

Despite a string of common enemies such as the haughty Djinn Sultanates and the demon-worshipping Xhazobines, the South-Western lands beyond the Salahadesi Desert have long defied the Khet’s felicitous will, instead exalting their pantheon of heroes-made-divine. During the First and Second Fangaula Empires' heights, Kheterata faced a formidable foe, but those times are laughably past; Now, only a bloated carcass ravaged by bickering scavengers remains.\n\nHorutep, setting his nemes atop his head, demands the lively Jelli to flaunt their melodies and talents in a new song: of Elikhet, of Nirakhet, (naturally) of Horutep, and, above all, Konolkhatep."

Already driven from the mainland, their only saving grace was being protected by the sea. But any empire with the resources to construct a fleet of note would make even this last line of defence quickly crumble, never mind us.\nHorutep could easily swallow this sad isle and all his inhabitants in a single bite.\nBut Horutep is not a devourer. He's not a mindless beast made of hunger. He's The Steward, the Master of the Great River itself. These little half men are easily bought - and not with gold, but with food.

From the great cities constructed under his watch to the myriad foes vanquished by his power – even the sacred Sorrow itself. The mask is his power, the mask is his beneficence, the mask is his favour. In light of this, Horutep saw it as a great shame that there was no physical mask. So he ordered that one be made, he ordered for it to be cast with the finest gold from Golkora and enchanted by the greatest workers of magic in Konolkhatep, so that it might be worthy of the King of Kings himself."

It is unfair to compare any Khet to the first among them, but at least a crumb of the same potentiality must reside in all of them. There must be a way to bring that out. And who could perform such a feat, if not the Prophet of Elikhet Himself?\nArmed with the newly crafted mask of Elikhet, His natural magical prowess and His infinite wisdom, Horutep embarked on maybe the hardest challenge He had yet to face: convince the Khet to put in some effort."

 konolkhatep_true_decadence_desc:0 "Horutep might have managed to make the Khet work together to push the boundaries of their domains, but not even he, in all of his glory, could stop them from indulging in excessive debauchery – some says he could, but he too enjoys some finer pleasures from time to time - slander, no doubt.\nIn fact, as the Khet influence grows, so does their desire for luxuries - they seem to be able to discover delights from farther lands even before tasting them the first time. The latest trend is Lencori Wine - not any wine though, no - they've become extremely particular in the choice of the winemaker, age of bottling, the wood the wine barrels were made of, and many other such factors.\nHorutep, content with the increased effort of the Khet in the realm of magic, has decided to appease them. Plans for a naval invasion have already been drawn up."

Those countless legends and fools that came before have attempted to carve their existence into the land in order to try and reach eternity. Yet time is all consuming and many of these great monuments stand as half sunk shattered visages, boundless and bare from years of neglect. To truly achieve what they failed to do, one must connect the present to their eternal past and lay the groundwork to forge an eternal future. Let all others behold our mighty works and despair!"
 
 konolkhatep_expand_medasi_title:0 "Expand the Medasi"
 konolkhatep_expand_medasi_desc:0 "The system of the Medasi has served Kheterata’s interests for millennia as a means of granting the realm a safe buffer from external threats, as well as influence over lands that would otherwise be too remote or distant to govern and defend directly. Horutep’s eyes gaze now on a system as old and dysfunctional as an unhappy elven marriage! The waves of corruption and chaos have left the institution a mess, with some Medasi forced to help manage vast swathes of land barraged by trolls and lizardfolk on the outside; with rebels and stubborn kings internally. While others are set to help rule singular cities, where the full scope of their tiny realm can be seen from their lofty bedroom’s many windows. This will not do for Horutep! By re-organising the Medasi to cover set larger domains instead of just assigning Medasi to whatever puny or turbulent realms that might already exist. These realms can better serve their purpose of protecting from outside threats and projecting power without the need of expensive garrisions. With larger Medasi comes the need for larger governors. Gnollish governors can better help rule these lands in a manner distant but familiar enough to old gnollish tribal clans. Any human Medasi that might object need be reminded that although gnolls have changed to worship the Khet, they continue to be edible to unhappy masters."

Gnollish yelps, howls, and chirps cut through the sound of battle as clear as glass, but the ears of our poor human subjects seem to struggle to understand our laconic tongue. Horutep has concluded that we must formalise the teaching of our language and stick to pronunciations most agreeable to our human subjects as to greatly improve our command of the battlefield.\n\nHorutep has so wisely seen that we can learn from the humans themselves. Our historians, merchants and our many soldiers have learned of the more structured and disciplined nature of human armies that we can build off of. We cannot lead a civilisation such as this with a monstrous rabble, but with grand Legions of gnoll and human together. The organisation of these troops on the field can too help build much needed trust and camaraderie between our peoples. If they can work together on the battlefield then surely they can in the field and the marketplace."

In that manner she is a cosmic being, opposed to Elikhet’s material nature as one who shapes physical matter. Thus it is no wonder she might be associated with the arcane powers of magic. Due to this association, when deciding on the aesthetics of his new sceptre Horutep decided to invoke her.\n\nIt is to be a staff to match the pillars of heaven in its grandeur; it is to be carved from damestear crystal blue as the waters of the Mothers Sorrow. The symbols of the weeping mother are to adorn its length, and it is to be bedecked in golden filigree."

Some advisors even suggested to Horutep that if we keep finding this many magical swords, a whole battalion equipped with them might be possible. But the ever so wise Horutep has plans of the extra-planar variety.\n\nSponsorships have gone out to our greatest mages and their respective cities, to attempt to better understand how the Planetouched wield their powers and attune to their respective planes. With enough bright minds working in tandem, a path might be found to intentionally tune to not just one, but all the planes mortals have come to bind with. This in turn will grant Horutep further means to blind the world with his pearlescent light. That is, if the effort doesn’t not rip both Horutep and the entirety of Halann in twain like some – now proscribed – cynics suggested. Let us hope our mages aren’t just pretending to understand what a geodesic is like the rest of us!"

Horutep must wonder if they could be persuaded to convert with images of Elikhet’s Pyramid, a shape is a shape after all. But a cavalcade of lies and false hope is false nonetheless and the Legions have finally extended our dominion far enough for our light to reach from Castonath to Anbenncost.\n\nIn an ever convenient stroke of most fortunate fate, this land is home to the great Luna river. The locals throw hedonistic and chaotic boat parties that ring off bells in Horutep’s memory of the pleasure barges of the Khet, albeit with a much lower chance of being eaten or turned into frogs. Maybe this familiar scene can be used as a display of such extravagance that the people of these lands will have no real choice but to gaze upon Horutep’s might."

Time can no longer bury us as its invincible cloak is now our own, with every grain of sand in Halann is scorched by Horutep’s majesty. If this is the true zenith one can reach on this rock, then decline or eternity are surely the only paths to now take, but how could Horutep’s brilliance ever fade? The greatest Khetarchs, the most dutiful Castans, the most vicious Xhazobines, most cunning Liches or cruelest Djinn would barely reach the might of our most mediocre Medasi.\n\nSo, eternity it is! And with that, true divinity. Even those Precursors of old would shake with jealousy at Horutep’s power. If the Day of Ashen Skies occurred today, Horutep could prevent it in his sleep and our realm would take barely a scratch if he didn’t. Oh great Divinity! On reflection, even those “real” smiters of mortals fail to reach the heights of Horutep, as we know they can die and be forgotten. Their immortality and eternity has clauses and loopholes to it as if it were authored by the sleaziest merchants. Horutep’s divinity is truly immutable. Has there ever actually been a true God before Horutep? One should not ask what Horutep will do now, but instead know that there is now nothing he cannot. That is our Apotheosis."

If our recent reports are true, the Xhazobkult schemes, not only among the whipped gnoll packs hiding in the mountains and deserts, but even beneath the ancient streets of Deskhak, Ekha, and Khasa. Truly, the Crodamic homeland fumes with demonic rot.\n\nThe protector of Kheterata stands before Akasik’s boundary, his divine gaze turning to his assembled host—no more cautions or dissent against the blood to be spilled.

As for the cramped slave districts, the Voice of Elikhet commands that if land offers no reprieve, then the waters shall shoulder Konolkhatep’s needs.\n\nResting amid the reeds of the Mother’s Delta, Horutep marvels at the gargantuan skeleton of wood and iron at the keel laying ceremony.

The Korbarid King Daravan the Malignant, in rash desperation, unleashed a terrifying spell, hoping to drown the invading foes. To the petty king’s credit, his curse worked, wilting the lush land into a deadly swamp and destroying friend and foe alike. History spared little mercy to his foolish act, terming the quag as either the Dreadmire or Daravan’s Folly.\n\nThough the Xhaz was stopped, the gnoll survivors adapted and endured in the blighted aftermath, becoming the Flamemarked Gnolls. Notable quantities of these forgotten siblings found their way to our slave markets (as both slaves and slavers), and, awestruck by the mighty Horutep’s gnollish countenance and just heart, prostrated before the Kult Ender for a single boon: to render Dostanor into a true homeland for their fractured packs.\n\nCruising through the mire, Horutep frowns at the desolation that his subjects pleaded to liberate—Dreadmire, indeed. A curse-brought blight, but to curse a blight in kind would mean transforming the marsh into a paradilic homeland and loyal Medasi for the supplicant Flamemarked Gnolls; by his godly might, he would see it so."

Smiling at the sprawling metropolis of Kheterat, he imagines the souls below...no, not just beneath his sacred abode, but all proud enough to call themself Kheteratan, from the largest sprawling metropolitan palace to the tiniest transient tent. Recalling his great works, peerless conquests, and magnanimous judgments, he prays (to Elikhet, to Nirakhet, to Aakhet, and any who entrusted him with trust and divine rulership) that Kheteratans see, just as he does now amid the embers of the horizon’s rising sun, how bright they shine as the wisest and greatest people upon Halann."

 flavor_konolkhatep.1.d:0 "Since the days of Rahkor, Bulwar has spent centuries and centuries under gnollish rule, be it Surael worshipping Suncrown kingdoms or zealously Xhazobkultist Sandfang packs. The Sun Elf conqueror Jaher thoroughly liquidated any semblance of gnoll supremacy on these lands, pushing the bitter Sandfang remnants to the mountains and deserts. However, after the Phoenix Empire crumbled, many gnolls would try to seize the opportunity to restore their fondly remembered lordship over the Bulwari.\n\nOne such gnoll was Tluukt Cleaver-of-Realms, a powerful mage who swiftly unified the local packs of the Sur Mountains, from the Flail Queens of Jixobix to the cruel slavers of Krahahga, and even the Suncrown ruled pack of Zhavekal. With her magic and her armies, she slew the Akal of Zanšap, humiliated the elven wizard Karodir I in duel and subjugated the proud city of Bulwar. After these victories, she undertook a series of reforms, trying to forge a kingdom strong enough to outlast her and consolidate solid gnollish rule over Bulwar.\n\nSuffice to say, we put an end to these delusions. The legacy of that wretched witch and her supposedly reformed armies were no match for the legions of Konolkhatep, and it is now clear that her victories were owed simply to the pitiful state of the Sun Elven and Bulwari kingdoms. Solid gnollish rule over Bulwar? Of course, but only from the hand of the mighty Konolkhatep can such a thing come to be.The deep spiritualism of the Sandfangs shall no more be wasted worshipping demons, or dead sun gods. Under the blessing of the Khet, we will succeed where they spent generations failing, and cement our rule over the lands of the Sun. The question is, should we absorb the Sandfang gnolls directly into Konolkhatep, forever erasing the old packs of the Sur Mountains, or should our emperor take the crown of Tluukt, and grant the cleavers of realms a degree of autonomy?"

He has filled the guts of the demons he worships with countless souls, all to satisfy his own hunger for power, and in pursuit of his wicked dream of becoming a vessel for a Xhazob demon and claiming the title of Xhazobain.\n\nIt is with this goal that he waged war on the zealous Desert Elves, shattering the aspirations of the nascent Jadd faith when he devoured their prophet in the battlefield. Devourer of Suns indeed he was, and after this victory he thought himself unstoppable. Indeed many feared this to be true, falling prey to terror and despair as they imagined this monster marching on Halann and feeding millions to the flames of his demonic masters.\n\nBut Jaddar was just an upstart commanding a ragtag band of elves, and even then the armies of Zokka defeated him only out of sheer luck. A luck that was not on their side when facing our glorious legions.

There, they slaughtered and enslaved both the Akasi humans and the local Stonewing Harpies, with thousands ending their days in the demonic pyres or tirelessly toiling under brutal slavery. As terrible and cruel was their rule in the lands of the mountain worshippers as were their raids across all shores and seas of the Divenhal. Even the haughty nobles of Anbennar soon learned to fear these demonically enhanced pirates, for they brought only death and chains on board of their dreaded ships.\n\nBut as our legions marched in Akasik, these wretched pirates found themselves outmatched on land and sea, their ships sunk, their slaves under new management, and their wretched demonic worship stopped once and for all. Fallen are too the old realms of Akasik, their mountain mother failing to protect them yet again, as it did when Elikhet slayed their Storm Queens. Ekha, Khasa, and Deshak have been saved from vile demon worship, but gnollish rule was an inevitability for these lands. Indeed they should be grateful that it is our benevolent and glorious empire that has finally subjugated them.\n\nMany kings there were who wore the name of Viakkoc, and cursed pirates and warlocks the lot of them were.

Both of the sister packs paid lip-service to the Xhazobkult, but it is no secret that the veneration of the Packmother was always strong here. The devotion to this bestial goddess, who they believe to be the mother of gnollkind, had a tight grip in the hearts of the hunters of Kogzalla. The merchants of Koggraffa however, more worried with coin than with faith, saw no harm in tolerating, and often embracing, all sorts of beliefs, from the Xhazobkult to the Kvangahga and even foreign faiths like the Bulwari Sun Cults or the Raheni philosophies.\n\nThe light of Khetism shall wipe all these false faiths away, as we seize the lands and the riches of these packs, and integrate their skilled hunters and merchants in our ranks.

In the center of the encampment was a gnoll whose eyes burned with green fire and the encampment’s warriors behind him. The flamemarked one began to speak to Horutep- what was he saying? It was in some dialect Horutep couldn’t make out. No matter- Horutep separated the poor wretch’s head from his shoulders with a well placed fireball. The soldiers of the flamemarked gnoll began gibbering in that same odd dialect, and about half of them broke for the hills. From experience, Horutep knew that the cavalry would be able to chase them down before they could regroup.\n\nThe remainder of the gnolls began to charge at Horutep, as if they hadn’t just watched their leader incinerate. Did they think he was out of fireballs? Horutep disabused them of that notion swiftly. From there, the assault was a mere matter of hunting down the cowards and stragglers of the encampment and treating what injuries Horutep’s forces incurred. This time, the injuries amounted to four injured gnolls in one of the right-flank cohorts, who didn’t follow their commander’s orders and were punished by the enemy for it. With luck, they would all make a swift recovery.\n\nAs the support regiments burned the last Kult to the ground, Horutep was struck with a sense of sadness. Was this all an ancient enemy of the Khet could amount to?"

It was a wretched and heretical place, and though Horutep wished to burn it down dearly, there were many of his subjects who thought of this “Aakhet the Bronze” as an object of worship rather than an object of mockery. Despite this, a summons from the dragon was not an everyday occurrence.\n\nHours later, he was rethinking his decision to go to the temple. The temple of Aakhet was seemingly composed of infinite rooms, and Horutep knew full well that the dragon was toying with him. Finally, Horutep reached a central room filled with gold and riches, but no dragon. Just when Horutep had determined that the summons was some form of juvenile power game and was preparing to leave, the hoard began to quake.\n\nThe hoard burst into blue flame, and from the molten gold emerged a man, seemingly carved from bronze. He was only a head taller than Horutep, but his presence filled the entire room. “Who dares disturb the worship of my subjects?” Aakhet boomed. “I am Aakhet the Immortal, Ruler of Kheterata, Guardian of Aramoole, Father of the Ahati…”\n\nIt appeared as though he was going to go on like this for a while. As Horutep made himself comfortable, he felt sympathy for the way he made all of his subjects stand to attention until the tribunes had finished reading off his list of titles. Horutep decided to occupy himself by seeing how many times he could throw a ruby scepter up into the air and catch it with his nondominant paw. He had reached two hundred and fifty five repetitions when he noticed the dragon staring at him. "Not bad, gnoll.” Aakhet clasped his hands together. “But you still have not answered my question. Why do you disturb the worship of my subjects?”\n\nAt this point, Horutep merely wished to go home. “There are two problems with your statement, mighty Aakhet.” Horutep said. “The first is that they are my subjects, not yours. The second is that I have not disturbed their worship. If you wanted to maintain their following, you should have considered instructing them to pray harder.”\n\nThe dragon’s countenance twisted, and Horutep thought to himself that his goading might have been unwise. As Horutep began preparing for a fight, the dragon burst out laughing. “Finally, someone with a sense of humor!” Aakhet held out a hand. “I am Aakhet the Bronze- we may dispense with formalities. We have much to discuss. Tell me, gnoll- do you play the Game of Khet?”"

Were it not for the different heights of the soldiers, they would appear identical. Each of them stood like statues, and their armor was polished so thoroughly that it appeared to glow.\n\nHorutep resumed his place at the front of the formation, and raised his staff in the air. “Legions of Konolkhatep! A new campaign begins.” The legions gave a mighty roar. “You have trained to your limits and beyond. If you had imperfections, you have smoothed them. If you had fears, your commanders have beaten them out of you. If you have worries, let me say to you now: none but the Khet know which of you shall live and which of you shall die, but I can promise you one thing.” The square was already silent, but the silence deepened as every man in the square focused on Horutep’s next words. “If you do not return as a corpse, you will return as a hero.” The men were trained to perfection, but they were not made of stone. The ones with spears pounded them on the ground, the cavalrymen reared up on their mounts, and the ones with only their voices sang the anthems of their legions with a pride fit to burst.\n\nHorutep marched onward to the land beyond the city.

Horutep could see well enough, but everything around him was shrouded in a dark miasma local entirely to itself. He cast a small divination spell to reveal that, apparently, it was daytime. Horutep shuddered to think what this place must look like at night. The forward team had already dispatched with the Shambling Mounds and performed the initial purification over long months, so that Horutep was free to approach the Matriarch itself, and as he did he began to chant. A purifying light emanated from Horutep, and the darkness was dispelling.\n\nThe darkness was pushing back. For just a moment Horutep’s concentration lapsed, and all of a sudden life was no longer worth living. Had the Khet abandoned him? They had, he knew they had! Then Konolkhatep was doomed to die, and the Sorrow and its fields would dry up, and Horutep’s people would stare at him in that way they did, but instead of devotion on their faces would be hatred, for Horutep had caused them such woe!\n\nThe roots under Horutep’s feet were shifting. Was the pallor of the great tree lifting? The tree appeared to be straining against internal bonds, and as it did the world seemed less dark than it did before. As the world got lighter, Horutep began to realize something: as long as he had even the smallest ember of faith, he could not give up on his Sorrow or his people, and as long as he had not given up they would at least have someone to protect them. What relief that all was not lost, and as Horutep thought about all he had yet to do he began to shine brighter, until the air around him was like the sun, and the darkness was receding, and the great tree (which was looking much healthier, now) began to surge past itself and suddenly-"

It was heavy too, made from pure gold and encrusted with gemstones and finery, its literal heft only lending credence to the symbolic weight of his actions as he lifted the mask above his face. Horutep held it there for a moment, as the raucous cheering of the crowd around him reached an ear splitting crescendo. In that moment of exaltation under the beaming sun, the world seemed to fade and he was alone within himself.\n\nHe was about to place upon his face the visage of god, when for a passing instant he felt a sliver of doubt. Who was he to take on the identity of such a being? He was but a simple gnoll, timid and fragile, he did little more than plead in a tomb when his nation was at threat, how could he - Neverkaar the Weak - wear such a face? He thought of all Elikhet had done, how he had raised the great pyramid, fashioned the halls of Koroshesh, banished the cursed genies of the Salahad and carved away desert and mountain with his holy waters. Elikhet always wore the mask, it was his very identity, Elikhet was the mask and the mask was Elikhet, something rotten and oh so far removed from divinity like Neverkaar could never wear it.\nBut his momentary doubt was dispelled when he remembered: he alone was chosen, he was the will, he was the one. He was Horutep, he was Elikhet.\n\nSo he released the mask, and it jolted into his face where it magically bound itself. Horutep raised his arms, and let the exaltation of his subjects wash over him."

The craftsmen of the staff, and various other men who were lucky enough to be admitted to his presence today stood nearby and watched, hoping that the steward would fancy their work.\n\nOnce Horutep arrived at the center of the area, he lifted the staff and pointed it parallel to the floor, shifting its weight and adjusting his grip. One could not exactly tell what the great gnoll was thinking, but he didn't seem upset at the very least; after a while he let gravity swing the staff into an upright position, then he lowered it to the ground and gauged its length. He produced a contemplative ‘Hmm’ before he tapped the staff on the stone. It flashed as magical energy ran down its length and kicked up a plume of dust at its base. Then he spread his fingers atop the staff and gently shifted them; the dust wound into a vortex and returned to the stone.\nHorutep nodded, then he flicked the staff across the ground. As it slid over the sandstone a wondrous glow lit up the tip; when it broke contact with the ground the gathering glow culminated in a bright flash. From the flash leapt a swirling luminous aquamarine aether that hurriedly shifted into a great streak of blazing fire, which raced along the ground and gathered into a tall plume at the other end of the platform. Horutep nodded again, slower this time as he beheld the scorched stone, still sizzling from the heat of his magic. He looked down at the staff and then to the craftsmen, who still nervously watched from the sidelines."

That changed today. Horutep’s spymaster laid a set of chains into his paws. They appeared to be made of the void itself, and Horutep knew then that the expedition to the land of the hobgoblins was a success.\n\nThe cell of the Mengi was guarded by twelve of Horutep’s personal guard: any less and the man surely would have broken free by now. Fortunately he was asleep when Horutep entered his cell, and Horutep took the opportunity to bind his hands and feet with the chains, which even then did not lose their color.\n\nThe Mengi opened his eyes and began to speak to Horutep. Horutep did not know much of the Mengi language, but the man appeared to be laughing? As the mage rolled around cackling on the floor with tears in his eyes, the twelve guards tightened their spear grips.\n\nEventually, the mage stopped laughing and sat up. He raised his bound hands to the sky, and spoke words with the feeling of fire behind them. Nothing happened. The mage appeared baffled for a moment, and then tried again. Nothing happened. The mage gritted his teeth. He stood on bound feet, and opened his eyes as wide as they would go. He chanted with the authority of a king and the focus of a priest in a rhythmic language passed down to him by his forebears for forty generations. His tone was laden with meaning and power. Nothing happened.\n\nA look of horror spread across the mage’s face, and Horutep and his guards began to laugh."

Today, they consisted of bearers of each of the Djinn artifacts collected by Konolkhatep, along with two hundred and sixteen of the planetouched. All present had been selected from volunteers among the unmarried and childless.\n\nThe party was weary, but as they approached, they began going about their tasks with a new vigor. Horutep stood in the middle of the circle, and the artifacts- some simmering with the appearance of the arcane, some appearing completely mundane, but all able to level cities- were arranged around Horutep in exactly the order that had been prescribed by the mages. As the bearers of the artifacts stood by, Horutep watched the two hundred and sixteen in silken robes arrange themselves in a circle around him. As Horutep looked further, he saw that each of the planetouched in his field of view was focusing upon him: the ritual had begun. At that moment, the geometry around Horutep began to shift.\n\nIf the six elemental planes had been parallel to each other before, it was as though they began to tilt across some unseeable dimension. As the air around him became water and the sand began to die, Horutep reflected on what his scholars had told him: it is only parallel planes that do not intersect. As the focal point began to coalesce, a wave of fire emerged from Horutep’s very center, and spread outwards to the very edge of the horizon. The luckiest of the planetouched died then. As the unlucky burned, none of them cried out: they were too well trained to risk disturbing the focus of their neighbors, if indeed either was still alive. At this point, Horutep could no longer keep track of each wave of elements- the pain grew to be too much. Horutep knew death was in the earthen air, and began to wish on all the Khet it would claim him too, if only to spare him one more moment at the intersection-\n\nHorutep crashed to the ground. Had he been levitating? As he lay on the sand, Horutep felt a weight at his core, and knew that within was the power of all six of the planes and more besides. Horutep gazed around him, and saw lakes of glass and trees of stone and everywhere dead planetouched, and on the horizon he saw the caravan he had appointed (Years? Hours? Days ago?) to take him away once the ritual was finished. He waved a paw on the horizon to flag them, and for an imperceptible moment six paws appeared to follow him."

The prow was gold, the oars were ivory, and the cabin of the barge was made of a glass so pure that rainbows danced across Horutep’s face as he sat on a perfectly carved throne backed by a wooden Khet that appeared to stare straight into the viewer’s eyes.\n\nAs the barge sailed down the Luna River, Horutep stared straight ahead past the oar slaves to a sight that was common at home: the houses and the farms and signs of civilization common to any riverbank. As Horutep sailed, he reflected: these buildings seemed so sad, as if their very essence was removed from them. This was the purpose of his Grand Mission today. Across years and years, he and a handpicked team of priests had prepared for this day. The Rectorates and the Temples of this land had been crushed, and they could not plague the people any longer.\n\nThe barge reached the outside of a city, and sailed underneath a bridge to emerge in a market square. Horutep straightened his back and adjusted his crook and flail with military precision. He was the avatar of his faith, and could not be seen to be less than perfect. As onlookers in the square drew closer- for they could not help but draw closer, as the barge had been enchanted with the most powerful enchantment magics of an entire continent- a curious tension began to build. Commerce stopped. Every pair of eyes in the square and the buildings beyond was affixed to the barge, until in the silence, a woman fell to her knees with a terrible wail. Horutep did not speak the language of this land, but he did not need to in order to understand. The woman was asking the question every one of the onlookers had: what is this majesty, and who has kept it from us? Horutep understood so clearly because he asked himself that same question all those years ago.\n\nAs the sound of the screaming died in the silence, the woman stood again to a new mood in the square- the conviction of the newly converted. Without words being exchanged, the square began to arm. The weaponsmiths threw open their stalls, and as each received their weapons they began to march to the city temple. Once the work was done the missionaries of Konolkhatep would follow.\n\n The barge sailed on."

He gazed out and saw in the light of dawn- as he knew he would- a Sorrow made more of barges than of water, with prosperity overflowing its banks. He would have to see about establishing a few temporal rifts along the river to accommodate the excess traffic- there was a slow day nine years and ten days ago that should be able to fit it all.\n\nHorutep stepped out his window and began to fall towards the stepped pyramid where his cheering throngs were waiting. It was a simple matter to manipulate gravity in this way, but it never failed to drive his subjects to adulation. He landed upon the top level of the pyramid, and gazed out on a city that contained cities itself, which in turn were filled with the greatest works upon Halann. From here, the people always appeared so small. He felt the connection between himself and each one of them, and their worship inspired in him benevolence.\n\nAs he did each day, he knelt then atop the pyramid to grant thanks to all the Khet and the gods- and was struck by a realization that carried the unmistakable ring of truth. He then knelt deeper into the stone of the pyramid, raised his paws to the skies, and cried out:\n\n“O Navigator!\n\nPast the world of Halann and past the Khet and past all the Astral lie walls of metal, and these contain our realm.

I felt a second presence within me, with its own consciousness, yet both our minds called for one thing. More flames. More blood. More power. I lifted the musket towards the remaining krah and felt the flames, stronger than ever before, crackle through my body, down the barrel, before unleashing a deafening volley of metal and fire, exploding and igniting all it hit. The ringing stopped as I turned to the crowd, and for the first time I could hear their roar."

In their eagerness to live the decadent lifestyle of the Khet, the self-appointed nobles of Konolkhatep have completely lost sight of the world outside the Mother’s Sorrow. As the Khet cannot leave the banks of the sacred river, so too can the nobility not see beyond the old Kheteratan heartland.\n\nThe latest report from Akasik has been the most alarming of all. Thousands upon thousands of people have been killed, burnt upon the pyres of the kultists. They have been stockpiling weapons, many of which have been purchased (or looted) from Cannorian ships. Some even claim they have developed a super-weapon. Some kind of fusion of gnoll with cannon, fueled by demonfire. The report ends with a warning that the locals believe a new Xhazobine walks these lands once more.\n\nThe nobles dismiss this as folly. Wishful thinking of a long dead faith. A Xhazobine? Here?

The Ahati Brotherhood believe this uprising could be a way to profit on new arms sales, certainly not join in themselves. $MONARCH$ frets over the finances, for funding more soldiers to clean up this mess will leave less in the coffers to build new temples in his name.

 flavor_konolkhatep.201.desc:0 "As the sun rises over Kheterat, one of the first buildings hit by its rays is the House of Golden Chains, an ornate palace home to the imperial bureaucracy of the same name. The palace is 120 cubits high and has a square base of 150 cubits, and at its apex is a dome of gold (as befits the name) inscribed with images of the Khet and the gnollish masters of the empire, so that all within its walls do not forget on whose behalf they labor.\n\nAs the day drags on, the complex accumulates the detritus of a day of busy administration – indeed, the House of Golden Chains is the single largest consumer of paper in Konolkhatep. Some of the clutter is cleared away when vast pyres are erected in the south and east gardens during the noontime break in order to burn the confidential letters received from governors and the reports of disfavored slaves, and the quantity of paper burned is so great that the resulting column of smoke is said to be visible from Nirat.\n\nWhen the sun sets for the day, those looking directly at the House of Golden Chains might be forgiven for not noticing, so vast is the number of lamps burned on each floor of the great palace. Such illumination allows the slaves to work their most un-Khetish hours all the way through the night."

It is for this reason that the Grand Granary was chosen to be located on a spit of land between two of the Sorrow’s distributaries in Aakheta, which in turn lies directly in the middle of the Sorrow’s great breadbasket.\n\nConveyor belts lace the sky around the great structure, moving the grain from its collection centers to the inside of the Granary, which in point of fact consists of five different complexes, with numerous siloes designated for the different grains grown along the Sorrow. From the granary itself, the grain is distributed to all the cities along the Sorrow and the network of barracks at the south of the river, using a vast fleet of barges."

 flavor_konolkhatep.203.desc:0 "Akasik was not always a booming hub of industry and agriculture. In fact, it was once a backwater, home to nothing more than a collection of subsistence-level farms and groupings of human huts whose inhabitants did not have even a surface-level familiarity with Kheteratan culture.\n\nAll that changed when an enterprising governor dispatched to the area, Grashak Keeper-of-Ledgers, had an idea. Given Akasik’s proximity to both the Mother’s Sorrow and the Dameshead, and given that nobody really important was living out there anyway, why not transform Akasik to fit the needs of both the Khet and a growing Konolkhatep?\n\nAnd so, work began. The Akasik mountains and the adjoining Krahway turned out to have vast reserves of iron, and after input from the Khet, the subsistence farms were transformed into vast sugar plantations which now provide much of the sugar consumed aboard the Khet pleasure barges (although there will always be purists who insist that Sorrow sugar can’t be beat). Unlike other areas, it was not even necessary to import the slaves to staff such an operation. The development of the area and the razing of the aforementioned huts and farms provided a vast population ready to be put to work, the descendants of whom now make up much of the population of Akasik’s great slave markets.\n\nToday, of course, Akasik is one of the greatest success stories of Konolkhatep, and the process of its development has been incorporated into the official curriculum for our provincial governors."

 flavor_konolkhatep.204.desc:0 "As Konolkhatep expands into the far east, what was once a ramshackle slaving operation run by exiled bureaucrats and enterprising corsairs has expanded to become a slave port even greater than the notorious markets of Sramaya and the Raghamideshi kingdoms.\n\nAt the port of Coburakaz, anyone with the coin can buy any type of slave they want. Strong slaves, smart slaves, pretty slaves, slaves that aren’t anything and are just good for dying, elves, harimari, and harpies: all these can be found among the market stalls. The stalls themselves stretch on beyond the auction houses and the grand docks, in a sprawl that seems to never end, such that a child born here might think that this port was the entire world.\n\nThe veteran ship captains, hawkers, and auctioneers are generally struck with a different thought. The sizzle of branding irons and the crack of the whips and the screams of the stupid or the unlucky bound for all corners of the world seem to make up a kind of rhythm, a song that everyone in the port knows by heart. The song is commerce itself, and its tune will make all who listen rich."

 flavor_konolkhatep.205.desc:0 "The Kheteratans worship all Khet as gods, but the problem of who sits at the top of the pantheon has been a matter of theological debate for centuries. The majority view is that Elikhet the Architect as creator of Kheterata is the greatest of all the gods, but a number of dissenters hold that Nirakhet as mother of Elikhet and creator of the Sorrow is the greatest god of all.\n\nWhat this means for everyday life in Kheterata is that the land is rife with accusations of heresy and recriminations between rival Khetist sects, especially given that the Khet themselves are not inclined to step in and settle anything. The gnollish faiths have no such complex distinctions or hierarchies, so the opinion of the Sorrowmane on such issues has always been somewhat more relaxed.\n\nIn an effort to spread this attitude among our subjects more broadly, we have constructed the High Temple of the Two in Nirat, venerating Elikhet and Nirakhet together, whose grand statues stand together on the highest point of the temple overlooking the works of their subjects. We have reunited Elikhet and Nirakhet at last, and they surely both would have seen this as the greatest tribute we could pay them."

Despite this, Golkora is now the world’s largest open-pit mine.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was at the time in the middle of a feud with the dwarven population of Ovdal Tungr across the Divenal, who smugly refused to acknowledge the great achievements of Konolkhatep or the Khet despite being provided ample evidence of our greatness simply by living across the sea from us. In Golkora, we saw an opportunity to obtain something even more precious than gold: the chance to show up those fool dwarves.\n\nThe expansion of the Golkora mine began immediately. Through the devotion of 50% of the mine’s aboveground administration area to a Feasting Annex, the Khet were convinced to aid excavation through the summoning of a number of meteorites onto the site of the mine, and external consultants with a similar chip on their shoulder were brought in to oversee the construction of all the necessary supports and infrastructure to keep the mine running.\n\nWith the vast amount of housing and support buildings required to keep the Abyssal Mine running, Golkora now more resembles a dwarven hold than a mere mine. Gold was not the primary motivation for the Golkora mine’s expansion, but we also found that in spades."

Thus Konolkhatep must do everything necessary to lure the world’s wizards to our doorstep, so that we can employ their talents on behalf of the state.\n\nIn the Hall of Kingdoms, we hope to do just that. The Hall has been built across from the Grand Library of Koroshesh, so that all of its wizards might partake freely of its knowledge, and itself consists not only of the classrooms, apothecaries, and training fields the wizards who flock to it might need, but also an entire internal community including residential and commercial areas, in the hopes that Halann’s best and brightest might take up permanent residence. The complex already hosts a number of Bulwari mages and shifters from East Sarhal, and an arrival from the Far East has told us of places even further abroad where magic is practiced in secret valleys by exiles and where spirits come to life.\n\nThe venture is already paying dividends of a more practical sort, as some of the top Transmuters of the Magisterium have taken up residence in the Hall of Kingdoms as a summer home and in payment have set up a workshop to transmute the mud from the bogs of the Mother’s Delta into precious gems."

 flavor_konolkhatep.208.desc:0 "When designing the Great Pyramid of Horutep, the royal architects were faced with a conundrum – how could any pile of bricks, no matter how high, begin to pay tribute to the glory of Horutep? The greatest minds of the empire thought for years on this question and came up with many ideas, including a pyramid made of solid damestear, a pyramid on an ornate barge that could sail the Mother’s Sorrow and, in a desperate attempt to mirror Horutep’s greatness with mere geometry, a floating octahedron under the theory that if one pyramid is good, two pyramids put together base-by-base must surely be better.\n\nIt was this last idea that exposed the limitations of their thinking to the royal architects. If no mere pyramid would ever be good enough for Horutep, the project must look beyond the structure of the pyramid itself. The final idea they arrived on, and the idea that stands in Kheterat to this day, is a humble pyramid no greater than any of the others across the city. At night, however, when all the other pyramids are shrouded by darkness, the top of Horutep’s pyramid opens to reveal a projector imbued with the longest-lasting of conjuration magics. Across the sky, the pyramid displays all of Horutep’s deeds for all in Kheterata to see, from his defeat of the Xhazobine to his meeting with Elikhet and many more besides. In the end, the only one great enough to match Horutep’s deeds was Horutep himself."
