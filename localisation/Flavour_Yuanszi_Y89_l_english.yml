 yuanszi_insincere_promises_title:0 "Insincere Promises"
 yuanszi_insincere_promises_desc:0 "The Xia does not yet feel the fever in its marrow. It has yet to notice its softening flesh, or its thickening veins, but we have. We come not as conquerors, nor as heretics, with blades bared and teeth gnashing, but as healers with steady hands. Let us slip beneath its skin as a gentle draught; soothing, warm, and welcome."

 yuanszi_new_xiaken_title:0 "The New Xiaken"
 yuanszi_new_xiaken_desc:0 "Within the Xia, we find ourselves deeply nestled. Our fingers wind around its bones. Our breath is its breath, in and out through rotting lungs. We wear scars of our own making, shackled to the Oni as we once were - a reminder that flesh must first be torn to be remade. Now, we are seen as the healed; as refugees, seeking peace in a new embrace. They are the tumor. But we are the cure."

 yuanszi_burn_heart_title:0 "Burn the Old Heart"
 yuanszi_burn_heart_desc:0 "All but the weakest bodies fight against sickness. The fever brings heat, the heat thirst and sweats. Things must worsen before they improve, as any good doctor would tell you. This is the crisis of healing. A cure is, by its very nature, destructive. Yet, when the deed is done, that which is left behind is all the better for it."

 yuanszi_build_heart_title:0 "Build a New Heart"
 yuanszi_build_heart_desc:0 "The veins have been cleansed by fever, the valves strengthened and fortified through heat, a heart has grown by blood, tears and sweat. \n\nWe must now activate this heart anew. The blood of might will flow to the heart and will be pumped into the body with more vigor, pressure and strength than ever before. We will push out any weakness while the heart will eternally hunger for more blood, more power, more chi. It will consume, and the body will heal and grow."

 yuanszi_tusk_boar_title:0 "Tusk of the Boar"
 yuanszi_tusk_boar_desc:0 "A sickening growth has appeared on the body of the Command. While benign, it shows potential for development into something more malignant. We should nudge Zau Boarborn, the growth that festers to damage its own body by making the Commands brain bleed: Moguwon."

 yuanszi_climb_ranks_title:0 "Climb the Ranks"
 yuanszi_climb_ranks_desc:0 "A newborn babe comes to live weak, needy and without any skill or knowledge. Yet it grows, consumes and it saps knowledge from its environment. So too must we feed, consume, nurture. Our warriors are newborn and must consume whatever they can to grow stronger and better than any of the other Xiaken. We will sap our environment for power, knowledge and most of all, its chi. We will become strong, while others become sick and weak."

 yuanszi_enforce_obedience_title:0 "Enforce Obedience"
 yuanszi_enforce_obedience_desc:0 "Patients always react to bad news in four stages: First is shock, as the mind is completely shattered by what they did not expect, yet deep inside knew to be so. Then comes anger, as they lash out at the doctor, their close ones and the world, throwing their fire and rage at whatever is in sight with disbelief. Then follows apathy, reveling in unending nihilism as the prospect of eventual demise looks ever more enticing to embrace. Lastly comes acceptance: the patient knows that the dark truth is to be accepted, embraced even and capitulates."

 yuanszi_one_path_title:0 "The One Path"
 yuanszi_one_path_desc:0 "To cleanse the old is to kill it, to cut out the rot blocking the healing of the body and the mind. Make it bleed so the sickness flows out of it. A river of pain that will, in time result in a healthier body. To unclog the arteries, one must pump them full to press out the silt, to make the truth flow unopposed and unbound. We are the doctors that accomplish this, we diagnosed, we operated and now we have succeeded in healing."

 yuanszi_heartbeats_devouring_title:0 "Heartbeats of the Devouring"
 yuanszi_heartbeats_devouring_desc:0 "A pulse, a singular strand of grain rises. Another pulse, a pea grows. Yet one again, a child is born. For a long time we sowed the seeds of renewal, not through temporal building but through destruction, diseasing and devouring. A vile odor enveloped the lands yet has now finally given way to the sweet smell of growth. Each day our methods lead to more food, more prosperity and more life. Through death we conquered. Each beat a new speck of life, each beat growing our wealth."

 yuanszi_black_mist_mines_title:0 "Black Mist Mines"
 yuanszi_black_mist_mines_desc:0 "Sometimes health and wealth are found in the same place, in that of blindness. To grow the body, one must ignore, nay, be blind to the horrors one inflicts on itself to truly grow. We must graft our own lands to reveal the muscles of industry and wealth. The lands will darken, yet heal. The shadows will envelop the skies, yet prove to be more clear and enlightening than ever before. The sun will be nothing more than a spec to aid in guiding the lost."

 yuanszi_black_monks_title:0 "Black Mist Warrior Monks"
 yuanszi_black_monks_desc:0 "Our warriors are ready. They have suffered, labored and bled and because of it they have healed and grown. The Black Mist Warriors are like no other monk warrior. They employ not just the blade, spear or the body but the environment itself as well. The black mists that surround them are like a thousand scalpels, cutting through all who come in contact with it as they die the most horrendous of ways: death by a thousand cuts, leaving behind a mangled mess that once called itself an “opponent”."

 yuanszi_friendly_faces_title:0 "Friendly Faces"
 yuanszi_friendly_faces_desc:0 "They came from heavens know were, in groups of numbers, uncountable. They came with a smile and promises of health, wealth and peace and delivered upon these. Village after village, town before town embraced the grimace of the Devouring Path, embracing the darkness and the forbidden like a child embracing its mother. The more destitute, the quicker they fall for the smiles and lies."

 yuanszi_sickened_veins_title:0 "Sickened Veins"
 yuanszi_sickened_veins_desc:0 "The patient arrived with a dark spot, and the doctor assured it was nothing. Yet it grew into something more. It followed the lines of the body, spreading a poignant odor unlike any before, and the doctor told it was nothing bad. Yet it spread, bringing a rot across the body that only grew, more bold and more blackening, and the doctor stressed that it was natural. Yet it completed a line across the body, spreading rot and slowly devouring the entire body, and the doctor smiled that it was good."

 yuanszi_shadows_will_title:0 "The Shadows Will"
 yuanszi_shadows_will_desc:0 "A pestilence has started to grow in the North, one of malcontent, anger and a desire for vengeance. We must prepare for the symptoms to boil over and for the wounds to break out in fester and blood. We must guide the pestilence so it can run its course and do its job, to strengthen the north and make it so the sickness that is the Command can be overwhelmed and treated. "

 yuanszi_ears_wolf_title:0 "Ears of the Wolf"
 yuanszi_ears_wolf_desc:0 "Of all sicknesses that plague one, those that threaten the brain are the most dangerous. The ear forms one of the quickest ways for a sickness to spread and cloud the mind.\n\nOur patient, Bei Wolfborn is one who is vulnerable to these illnesses of the mind. Suffering from the plague of self delusion and arrogance, of twisted speaking and of feeble shortsighted ambition. Let us use this sickness to fight the rot that the Command poses to our own ambitions."

 yuanszi_tortured_mist_title:0 "Path of the Tortured Mist"
 yuanszi_tortured_mist_desc:0 "To kill is to ensure rebirth, yet we must be very precise and precarious about this. We must suffocate it by slowly infecting the air, the mists of the lands. Our techniques of manipulation will act as a bitter medicine. This process will be slow, yet by doing this almost invisible to the unaware. A thousand cuts, from a thousand small blades will slowly wound, infect, suffocate and finally overwhelm the lands, so that we may reanimate it into something stronger, better and more enlightened. Death comes for all, yet only a doctor can ensure a good life afterwards."

 yuanszi_the_blade_title:0 "The Blade"
 yuanszi_the_blade_desc:0 "We are no occupiers who want to threaten the innocent, we are healers who offer treatment and guidance. We come not because a patient wants us there, but because they need us to become better. We must treat them through methods they may oppose, yet cannot resist. We must remove that which is making them sick to ensure no harm to either them or us, and to ensure the doctor can use it as a tool of betterment."

 yuanszi_the_gauntlet_title:0 "The Gauntlet"
 yuanszi_the_gauntlet_desc:0 "Sometimes a healer is not welcome anymore. The patient and its family sees them as a threat to their perception of normalcy, blind to the fact that this normalcy is what kills the patient and threatens to infect the family as a whole. The healer is no enemy, yet no friend either. They offer treatment and sometimes it must be administered without the consent or support of those most dear to the patient. We are that healer, and now we must start the treatment."

 yuanszi_northern_frontier_title:0 "Northern Frontier"
 yuanszi_northern_frontier_desc:0 "To ensure our patients' healing, we must ensure a good place for them to recover. They must be able to strengthen their muscles once more and their mind to be focused yet again. Let us provide a suitable place for this recovery by annexing the lands north. This should be rather easy, as they have only recently recovered from the rot that the Command was."

 yuanszi_yan_under_mist_title:0 "Yan Under Mist"
 yuanszi_yan_under_mist_desc:0 "The air is filled with dread, temples dotted around like tumorous spots keep the veins rotten and ready for our ambitions. We must now prepare for a greater operation, a greater surgery, one which requires more healers, more men prepared to administer the remedies we have prepared. We will train new Warriors of the Black Mists, more there will be, more! They will march across the lands as a dark cloud of suffering, breaking all who dare to oppose us!"

 yuanszi_blight_extremities_title:0 "Blight to the Extremities"
 yuanszi_blight_extremities_desc:0 "A sickness does not spread unless it has a way to do so. It cannot be airborne without a trachea to burn. It cannot be bloodborne without veins to rot. It cannot be fluid without intestines to cut. If we want to spread the blight to the extremities of the continent, we need a way to spread it. It needs to be able to creep forward and slowly weaken and fester to reach the furthest reaches of the continent. Only by preparing and pushing the most vile of rot and blight through the arteries can we achieve our goals and can we truly heal the lands of Haless."

 yuanszi_temples_travelers_title:0 "Temples for Travelers"
 yuanszi_temples_travelers_desc:0 "The peculiarity of sickness is how attached people can get to it. Without it some feel lost and unfocused, as the blight gave them a comfort unknown before. The blight offered comfort and perspective, it gives a calm like none before and offers a focal point. It becomes a symbiote with the body and without it one feels without purpose. The ones along the veins feel like they cannot live without it any longer and the strange odor becomes like the smell of home, the rot a welcoming sight to those who otherwise felt lost."

 yuanszi_invite_outcasts_title:0 "Invite the Outcasts"
 yuanszi_invite_outcasts_desc:0 "The weak minded are easily scared, and as such, easily manipulated. They see the enlightened as madmen who have embraced a disease without realising that they themselves are who have embraced the madness of decay and death. Let us assure these feeble minded fools of our good intentions by offering “aid” and shelter to the madmen. Let us act like doctors taking a patient in, without telling those weak fools that in doing this, they open themselves and their lands to the healing rot we provide. We will shelter the enlightened and prepare them to heal their fellow countrymen, even if they do not want to be healed."

 yuanszi_prosperity_faithful_title:0 "Prosperity for the Faithful"
 yuanszi_prosperity_faithful_desc:0 "We were seen as mad seers by all. They scoffed at us and said we would bring only death and decay to the lands of Haless. How foolish they were. They did not understand that to be reborn, one must first die. To grow strong, one must first make the muscles brittle, the arteries rotten and the heart broken. The body was mutilated and grafted to allow for all pieces of this corps to be revived in our image. And through this rebirth the lands have not only healed, but strengthened. It is stronger than it ever was, more enlightened than ever before and more alive than it has ever dreamed of. Haless died, long live Haless…"

 yuanszi_great_scouring_title:0 "The Great Scouring"
 yuanszi_great_scouring_desc:0 "We prepared the patient, making them understand that the procedure that they will undergo will be long, painful and though necessary; deadly. They know what is about to happen, and even though they will most likely resist for a final time, they will eventually accept. They will die, cut open and bleed out. The rot will flow freely through the body and prepare it for the transformation it undergoes. Our Smiling Men will break the organs and we will perform the final surgery: To break, ensnare, enslave and cleanse the spirit of the land, the final piece needed to allow the body to fully transform and be reborn."

 yuanszi_haless_defiled_title:0 "Haless, Defiled"
 yuanszi_haless_defiled_desc:0 "Out of the eyes comes water, out of the veins comes tar, out of the mouth flows blood and out of the extremities flows pus. We twisted the limbs beyond their limits, we snapped the spine like a twig and we cut the body with a thousand knives open and mutilated it beyond recognition. The corps has collapsed, the surgery is complete. And now we reanimate it."

 yuanszi_brain_lion_title:0 "Brain of the Lion"
 yuanszi_brain_lion_desc:0 "The mind is a powerful tool and in case it is diseased, the most dangerous of all. It can cloud any form of judgement and create dissonance more absurd than the wildest of dreams. It can break the will of the body through sheer thought and a well prepared healer can help repair it, or break it beyond return.\n\nThe mind we are about to break is that of Kuen Lionborn. While most of his kind find humanity vile and weak, he sees in them almost equals. How foolish of him to think we would hold ourselves to his archaic principles of honour for honour sake or a code of conduct. They are mind viruses that we must stamp out eventually, though in this case we must use them to gain access into the Commands deepest thoughts and ideas. We will learn from them that which they would want nobody to find out and use it to break their mind beyond return."

 yuanszi_grand_spymaster_title:0 "Grand Spymaster"
 yuanszi_grand_spymaster_desc:0 "To gain access to our most resistant patients, must we promise them true healing. We must show them a clouded vision which promises health, strength and wisdom. We offer them eyes and ears afar, to gain access to wisdom and secrets beyond their wildest dreams. We will give them what they want, while in turn they will open themselves up to our procedures, medicaments and eventually; surgery."

 yuanszi_hills_eyes_title:0 "The Hills Have Eyes"
 yuanszi_hills_eyes_desc:0 "Within the hills north resides our own former doctor. One we have for a long time, when we were weak and feeble, we were seen as healers like none before. How times have changed. We still see them as wise, though lacking ambition and in truth responsibility. They refuse to help the entirety of Haless and so we must cleanse their mind of this foolishness. Let us prepare a procedure that will change their minds and clear it of these clouds of apathy and sloth. They will understand and one day thank us for it."

 yuanszi_oni_kneel_title:0 "The Oni Kneel"
 yuanszi_oni_kneel_desc:0 "Sometimes the patient struggles and fights back, not wanting to understand why they are being treated. They are addicted to their foolish and blind ways and resist, fearing the unknown. Our old master felt the same, and while they resisted, they have been broken and through this healed. Most accept the new reality and the procedure we gave them. They will be good healers themselves and useful in aiding our ambitions. We just need to administer one last remedy…"

 yuanszi_secrets_ancients_title:0 "Secrets of the Ancients"
 yuanszi_secrets_ancients_desc:0 "Most medical procedures are learnt by doing, though to know about them, one must sometimes read about them. The Oni know of procedures that we have yet to even fathom and as such we need access to this vast quantity of wisdom if we are to truly and most thoroughly operate on Haless. The Oni will not be happy, though eventually they will see that we are more than capable of performing these procedures on our own and that they can rest easy knowing we will take good care of our patients."

 yuanszi_arterys_edge_title:0 "Artery's Edge"
 yuanszi_arterys_edge_desc:0 "To truly prepare our patient for its great procedure, must we first gain access to their arteries. We must be like a needle, cutting through skin and flesh to reach the veins and inject our medication into them. We must strike swiftly and precisely, for a botched needle can do more harm than good. Luckily our fellow doctors in the hills have to offer us a lot of experience and advice on how to do this, and together we can perform this procedure with the utmost care and precision."

 yuanszi_kharunyana_mist_title:0 "Kharunyana Under Mist"
 yuanszi_kharunyana_mist_desc:0 "If the Yanhe is the main artery of Yanshen, then the Kharunyana is that of Rahen. Our expansion of our “surgical apparatus” through means of militant and spiritual will allow us to start the cleansing through infection of Rahen. The mists will envelop and twist the lands, crack its bones and seep deep into the marrow, rotting it down to its core. The new legions of Black Mist Monks will march like an unending tide of suffering and pain. With a thousand cuts they will let the lands bleed, from the Kharunyana they will make those who stand against us suffer. Through this we will start operating on the whole region. And so the Philosophical flesh of Rahen will wither and give way to a Devouring skeleton."

 yuanszi_blackened_eyes_title:0 "Blackened Eyes"
 yuanszi_blackened_eyes_desc:0 "To blind one is to make them susceptible to whispers and lies. For too long have the people of Haless put their faith in the quacksalvers of the oracular order. No more we could say, though this would mean that we would be blind ourselves, as we would deprive ourselves of a good opportunity. Instead of dismantling the oracles, we should use them ourselves, ripping out their eyes of foresight, and reuse them to further our own cause. The Eyes will blacken, though we will see more clearly than ever before!"

 yuanszi_fractured_ribcage_title:0 "Fractured Ribcage"
 yuanszi_fractured_ribcage_desc:0 "The skeletal structure of Haless is a fragile one, which we have more than ever before bruised, broken and hollowed. Now it is time to break the High Temples or more precisely; the ribs and the spine, the last lines of protection before we can infect, rot and replace the organs of this sick and weak continent. One by one the ribs will snap, whether with brute force or cunning precision, all will crack eventually. Only then can the delicate lungs be reached, only then can we fulfill our ambitions and destiny."

 yuanszi_broken_spine_title:0 "Broken Spine"
 yuanszi_broken_spine_desc:0 "Like twigs the ribs were broken, causing the lungs of this sickening place to move ever more heavy. Now it is time to ensure these wounds are permanent, by breaking the spine. When all Temples are within our hold, all will be unable to resist our swift and final blow. Like a dry log it will snap, its cracking reverberating across the lands of Haless, ensuring the terminality of our cause. It will be impossible to stop us, as with a spine broken, the continent will be unable to move against us ever again."

 yuanszi_tar_banks_title:0 "Tar on the Banks"
 yuanszi_tar_banks_desc:0 "We are ready. We have trained day and night for this procedure and finally we will move into action. Our spies and assets will move across the arteries of the continent, infecting the organs, tissue and veins wherever they move. The Temples will act as buboes of tar, spewing out more rot and pestilence everyday. They will infect the entirety of the lands of Spirit and Shrine, diseasing it beyond recognition and beyond saving. We will spread like cancer, though in the end it will be both terminal and reviving."

 yuanszi_rot_arteries_title:0 "Rot in the Arteries"
 yuanszi_rot_arteries_desc:0 "Merchants are like pimples. They pop up, and even though you can be thorough in their removal, they always return. Wherever they go, trade goes and wherever trade goes, they go. We should use these parasites by infecting them with our own parasites, our operatives who will spread the rot ever further. The arteries and veins will be their highways and through the cunning and deceitful smiles of our merchants, will they gain access to the innermost intestines of the continent."

 yuanszi_bleeding_tar_title:0 "Bleeding Tar"
 yuanszi_bleeding_tar_desc:0 "It started with a black spot, it then became a line of rot following the arteries. Eventually the hands, feet and limbs became blackened. They rot, they wither, spreading pus, odor and bile across the rest of the body, infecting it further. Like a septicemic plague it spread slowly, though unstoppable. The lands are passing away, and one day they will thank us for it."

#Events
 yuanszi.1.t:0 "The Shadows Will"
 yuanszi.1.desc:0 "The Command spreads across Haless like a disease, but the body fights back. Even now the men of Sir whisper in their fortresses of rebellion. The tumorous mass from the Jade Mountains falters for just a moment. If we are to cure Haless, we should move to join the Northerners in their revolt, but doing so will put us in great danger. We must decide what is the will of the shadows."
 yuanszi.1.a:0 "The risk is too great. We will excise this mass of diseased flesh later."
 yuanszi.1.b:0 "It is already too late! We must act now if we wish to save anything!"
 yuanszi.2.t:0 "The Blade"
 yuanszi.2.desc:0 "They ought [Root.Monarch.GetName] easily stopped, their arrogance visible like a blistering sickness across their faces. Prepared to stop our armies through their foolish thoughts of honour, pride and rule bound conduct they blocked the path into Jianxusi. But they were not just mistaken, they were terminally wrong. Our men, using their rudimentary Black Mist techniques were able to take the guards of the blade by surprise. Cut by Cut, slash after slash the guards fell to our warriors, a river of blood engulfing the citadel of the blade, staining the walls red for generations. [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked in afterwards, with a proud yet stern smile on [GetHerHis] face. The bodies of the fallen were tapped for their chi, plundered for their wealth and dumped into ravines, to be forgotten by time. \n\nAnd so in the grand hall, sheathed on a pedestal it lay resting, the great blade Kongren, the killer of conquerors, defiler of tyrants. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eyes shimmered as they approached the blade before quickly snatching it from its resting place. From now on, the blade will act as a tool of surgeons, making the most difficult of cuts necessary to fulfill our destiny. Its power will no longer be in the hands of the weak and hesitant, but in the hands of the strong and bold. Our blade, our power."
 yuanszi.2.a:0 "Power belongs to those who take it."
 yuanszi.3.t:0 "The Grand Spymaster"
 yuanszi.3.desc:0 "We offer whispers and ears. We offer an eye in the darkest of places, ears in the most sacred of sanctums and mouths in the most hostile of courts. We offer our services to the Wulin, to spy on the enemies of the Warrior Monks of the Xianjie and to sow doubts, fears and lies in the palaces of their enemies. They accept, as they cannot help wanting the whispers for themselves, they hunger for it and we will deliver them on a silver platter. They will unbeknownst give us access to their deepest secrets, their greatest of fears and the well kept knowledge of the region. They will think we are their healers, while in reality we slowly infect the Wulin and its minions with concoctions of slow decay and death. They will hate us for it, though it will be their own fault, as they were the ones who allowed us this position, they gave us the title of Grand Spymaster."
 yuanszi.3.a:0 "Just smile, and spy…"
 yuanszi.4.t:0 "A Duel at Dawn"
 yuanszi.4.desc:0 "A wretched bastard, traitor, slithering snake! A hundred of names we were called when the Wulin received our formal request for a duel for the rulership over the Xiaken. They screamed foul play, subterfuge and broken promises. We were in their eyes not just unworthy, we were the lowest of the low, lower even than the Command or the Jiangshi. Yet they knew that refusal is impossible, we are a legitimate Xiaken after all.\n\nSo with a head raised the Wulin accepted, preparing for a duel at dawn, when the dew had only just settled on the ground. [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled when they approached the duel grounds. Chatting with their retinue while the leaders of the other Xiaken stood around silently, looking at us with disgust and fear.\n\nAnd so the duel begins. A hit! The Wulin punched our ruler at the shins, causing them to almost lose balance. The next punch they blocked, and the next, and the one after. They defended against the swift and emotionally loaded attacks the Wulin threw. [Root.Monarch.GetName] waits until the best moment to strike back, in the meanwhile dodging and blocking the attacks the Wulin throws with all of their might, they want to end it here today, both [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Yuanszi itself. But an opportunity presents itself and [Root.Monarch.GetName]..."
 yuanszi.4.a:0 "Punches with the might of the Shadow"
 yuanszi.4.b:0 "Kicking with the anger of a devouring swarm"
 yuanszi.5.t:0 "The Duel Proceeds"
 yuanszi.5.desc:0 "A treacherous snake, that is what some of the Xiaken leaders began to shout whilst the Wulin started to slowly get the upper hand in the fight. A crack was heard as the Wulin kicked [Root.Monarch.GetName], most likely fracturing a rib or two. Plunging to the ground, and in deep anger, [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks on what to do. Beating the Wulin in a fair fight seems like a fool's errand now. This patient has gone berserk, and is rampaging through what you wish to become a clinic of health. If you cannot play nice or honourable, you must use tactics that are a bit more underhanded. So in a desperate attempt, [Root.Monarch.GetName]..."
 yuanszi.5.a:0 "Bites the hand of Wulin like a threatened snake"
 yuanszi.5.b:0 "Spits in the eyes of the Wulin like a cornered viper"
 yuanszi.6.t:0 "The Duel Grows Desperate"
 yuanszi.6.desc:0 "For a moment the Wulin backs off, not having expected you to use more dishonorable moves, which are technically illegal, though the Wulin does not care for this, they want to end [Root.Monarch.GetName] now and for eternity, so foul play is on the table as the Wulin nods to the referee to back down from doing his job. And with punches slashing and kicks bursting, [Root.Monarch.GetName] seems to be finished. They cannot even seem to stop the most mundane of attacks anymore, and all seems lost, all that Yuanszi has worked to is about to die in Xiaodao, with thunderous applause."
 yuanszi.6.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s aid throws Kongren, and you slash…"
 yuanszi.7.t:0 "A New Order"
 yuanszi.7.desc:0 "With eyes hollow the Wulin looks at you, completely ignoring the fatal wound you inflicted upon them with Kongren. In their last thoughts they seem to feel utterly betrayed, not by you, but by Kongren, the very manifestation of Xiaken power. What killed the Xia is not an outsider force like the Command, the Raj or Bianfang, No it is the very object which represents the independence of the misty hills. You are no more, and neither is the Xia of old.\n\nA deafening silence follows, the Xiaken rulers staring at their dead ruler in shock and horror. None make a sound though they all seem to think in unison: impossible. Bruised and battered, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands up, exclaiming a roar of anger, pride and victory all in one. Spitting one last time upon the corpse of the old Wulin they declare…\n\n“From now on, no longer will we tolerate the weakness and sickness that has plagued these very hills, towns and monasteries. No more will we bow down to the sad sorrow of the feeble or the tumour that isolation has become. First we will transform these lands into a clinic, to cleanse, to heal, to rebirth anew a continent which has been sick to its very core. From now on we will be the only way forward. We will devour the lands around us, and will in the end, heal them from their own delusions. Heed my words, for one day we will return here, stronger, healthier and better than ever before. Yet first we need to start to rot and wither…”"
 yuanszi.7.a:0 "And now for those treacherous subjects of mine…"
 yuanszi.8.t:0 "Triumph of the Devouring Path"
 yuanszi.8.desc:0 "It began with a scream. A servant lady sees the leader of one of the Xiaken having its throat slit by a shadowy figure in front of her very eyes. A stable boy sees the commander of the warrior monks killed through a spine snapped. Everywhere, all at once the dark Wulin struck, getting rid of the last vestiges of the old. Each and every ruler which had not yet fully bowed down to [Root.Monarch.GetName] or to the Devouring Path was on the list. A slaughter ensued as all who opposed the new order were stamped out in unison. Their spines snapped, their necks twisted and their throats carved up. Blood spilling everywhere, tears flowing freely. \n\nIn the aftermath, [Root.Monarch.GetName] appoints the new leaders of the Xiaken, loyalists of course. These new rulers sing the praises of the Devouring Path, worship the Wulin as the master surgeon and suck up to the new order like a whimpering child wanting sweets, so pathetic, yet so useful."
 yuanszi.8.a:0 "And by letting of blood, a healthier land arises."
 yuanszi.9.t:0 "Pieces on the Board"
 yuanszi.9.desc:0 "Whenever we presented a new plan, some kept complaining. They claimed that their ambitions were to big for these plans and that we should, if we wanted to fully utilise their potential, expand our ambitions. For days we made new plans, drew new maps and planned for ever larger and more expansive campaigns. Our Xiaken kept being ever more ambitious to the point of being unbearable. In the end we made a new plan, and though some still complained, they all went silent when [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked in. They didn’t say a word, they merely scanned the room and kept an eye on everybody in there. The Xiaken felt the presence of the Wulin, like a heavy weight pressing on their minds, they simply could no longer protest. And so the master strategist explained the plan. To turn the Shamakad portion of the Yan and its dependencies into a second Xianjie, a land shrouded in the same mists, covered in the same temples and monasteries and bursting with the same, cleansed chi that we have provided to the Xianjie proper. All nodded in approval, and so finally a new plan was clear. The final maps drawn, the last plans written down and pre-made orders ready to be distributed to our forces. The Yan will first die, and afterwards it will rise again, in our image."
 yuanszi.9.a:0 "The time has come for the Yan.."
 yuanszi.10.t:0 "Yan Under Mist"
 yuanszi.10.desc:0 "When we arrived in Shamakhad, the locals feared us. Seeing us as nothing more than another conqueror, another Command or another “heroic” king of old. We were sure to be a new batch of plunderers who would bring nothing but death and destitution to these ancient lands. Yet we are no killers, we are healers. We heal the people of the region through methods unheard of, but effective like no other. We are doctors who will help rebuild Shamakhad by choking it in the same mists that envelop and cleanse the lands of Xianjie. We will help rebuild farms, fertilize the fields and build up the infrastructure connecting them all. All of these will be guarded by great shrines and temples dedicated to the cause of healing and the Devouring Way. They will form nexusses of our power while great road networks will flow through the land, bringing wealth, prosperity and a rebirth of Shamakhad that make the hero kingdoms of old look pathetic children playing with nothing but sand and clay. The lands will grow, and the chi will flow."

Under no circumstance other than total disobedience or revolt will the Wulin be allowed to take over the entirety of the lands belonging to Azjakuma.”\n\n“Agreement number two: All of the lands belonging to Azjakuma will, in perpetuity, be subject to the rulings and agreements of the Wulin of Xiaodao. All of the decisions which deal with matters other than internal judiciary, administration or non-border crossing economic activity will be subject to supervision and when necessary change as the overlord in Xiaodao deems needed. Other internal activities can, in need be subject to the same oversight, when the Wulin deems this to be needed to preserve the order and harmony of both lands”\n\n“Agreement number three: To ensure the security of operatives from Xiaodao, and to prevent any malicious and unruly subjects from taking root in the Azjakuma state, all the defensive capabilities of the Shirgrii, including walls, wards and other non-corporeal and magical elements are to be dismantled.”\n\n“Agreement number four: To ensure harmony and peace, all lands that are in the future added to the Azjakuma state will be fully subject to the religious doctrine of Xiaodao, and are as such required to fully convert to the Devouring Philosophy of the state and to be completely subject to its clergy and representatives. These will have full amnesty in the lands of Azjakuma to achieve harmony and will be allowed, within reason, to act as they deem necessary to achieve their earlier stated goal of harmony and peace.”\n\n“Agreement number five: To ensure the stability and prosperity of Azjakuma, any and all economic activity is left up to the Oni ruling council and its leader, yet are in turn subject to the Wulin, who can, when deemed necessary and within reason, overturn and change economic planning. The administration in Xiaodao is furthermore made responsible for the economic prosperity of both the lands of the Xianjie and of Azjakuma, and as such required to make an active contribution, in ways the state deems necessary.”"

From now on these lands follow the only true path forward, the One Path, The Devouring Path. From the lowest valley to the Highest peaks, all embraced the liberating philosophy of the Devouring Path and the power and prosperity it brings. While once, the monasteries’ songs were of “harmony”, “blessing” and the free flowing of chi, they now praise through hums “power”, “strength” and the devouring of chi. No longer do these Xiaken act like scared children, instead they act like enlightened sages. The One Path is that of unlocking true potential, of healing the lands through destruction and rot."

They offered us something we could not resist, and invited our Wulin to the libraries of the Shirgrii to learn more. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wholeheartedly accepted and traveled to the lands of the demons, eager to learn more. Guided by one of the foremost monks of the Oni, [Root.Monarch.GetName] entered the library deep inside the bellows of the temple fortress. Here the Oni explained how for eons they gathered knowledge on not just the devouring of Chi, but of the manipulation of essence in all forms or states of matter. They explain that to truly gain power, the greatest form of essence must be tamed, that of the Spirits of Haless, which roam the lands of Haless ever more present. The Oni claim that the time to act upon this is now, as they have foreseen a return of even greater spirits to Haless, which threaten to undermine the power and influence of those loyal to the One Path in particular. Rise we must challenge and cloud the spiritual will of the continent before they can think straight and break the spine of Haless before they can act against us, for if we do not act, Haless will devour us and kill itself before we can ever dream of healing this sick continent."

The Oni see us just like we see ourselves; as healers who will need to kill, reconstruct and revive Haless for if we do not do this, all will eventually wither and die under its own weight. The Oni compared the rivers, which have for eons transported most people and goods across the lands like arteries and veins. The great rivers of Haless, the Kharunyana, Yanhe, Telebei or Dhenbasana forming the main arteries and its many tributaries acting like veins to the further corners of the continent. To take over Haless, we must take over the heart and let it beat on our rhythm. We achieve this by letting our rot flow through the arteries, into the veins, right into the High Temples, together forming a heart we ought to blacken, twist and rot. It is a great task, which only we are prepared to take on and complete. It will hurt, it will burn and the heart will stop so that it may eventually beat once more in unison with ours."

Nay, instead the lands will be able to finally breathe in the burning yet purifying airs of the Devouring mists. The lands will be enveloped in the same matter as our own, filling each inch of land, each crevice with these mists of cleansing and healing. The lands will feel pain, they will scream and bleed in agony, yet like in a surgery, blood must flow and pain must be felt in order to heal. They will first hate us for it, then they will thank us for it and eventually all of the Kharunyana lands will embrace us for it."

The corpses of these so-called Oracular Guards and watchers filled the rooms of the monastic complex and bit by bit the Order was brought to its knees. On the floor of the High Augurs assembly hall, the High Augur sat down himself. He whimpered like a child, unable to understand how he could not have seen us coming. And so the Wulin, [Root.Monarch.GetName] approached, accompanied by the high ruler of the Azjakuma to offer magical guidance when necessary. Walking over the innumerable corpses of the Orders guard, they entered for an “audit” with the High Augur. Kneeling before the broken ruler of the Oracle, [Root.Monarch.GetName] spoke: “As blind as you were to the rise of our might, so too is the continent blind to its very own sickness. This continent is sick yet can only see its healers as butchers, yet with your order and help, we can change this. You and your Augurs will be part of the new order, the new path, the One Path, blinding the weak, the foolish and the hostile. They will have eyes blackened by tar and rot, their eyes completely removed if necessary, and your Order will be part of it. So get off the ground and prepare for the new future that awaits, a future in which the blind will finally bow for the enlightened.”"

Everywhere the tar flows, the rot goes. All will feel the rot spread, the tumorous mass grow and the sickness rise. All will be enveloped and unable to fight it, our agents and assets working as sickening matter in each and every vein, bit of flesh and limb. The blackening rot, brought on by the tar will be unable to be stopped, whether on the surface or deep inside the arteries and bones it shall spread. Haless will die, Haless will wither, yet in the end Haless will be reborn, all while we keep pumping the tar at the beat of our blackened heart."

Let these Great Spirits be rotting away just as the corporeal beings of this sickening continent. They will rot and be corrupted by our Smiling Men, not even these are able to resist the smiles. They will bow before us and we will tear them apart for every limb, organ and tissue they offer us. Their glowing flesh and unstoppable chi will be devoured by us, we will be offered a great buffet, great enough to finally satiate our never ending hunger for chi.

No longer will they throw the lands of the High Temples into chaos, or spread their sick presence across the fields of the innocent.\n\nWe infected every bit of tissue of this great continent. We cut open every bit of skin vein and artery, letting blood and sickness flow freely. We broke each and every bone, its splinters ripping open ever more flesh for us to infect and rot. We smothered the breath of the land, letting it choke in its own blood, bile and weakness. We blackened and poked out the eyes, blinding them to our ambitions. We ripped off every limb with unmatched strength. We cut out every organ and smashed and crushed it into an unrecognisable pulp of flesh, decay and death. We created a stench unbearable to the weak and pathetic. And we clouded and broke the mind of Haless, to be unable to resist our offer.\n\nWe deconstructed and killed, yet now we can rebuild and reanimate.\n\nWe disinfected with doctrine. We cauterized with tar. We reset bones with strength. We let inhale our harmony. We show vision through power. We stitched back the limbs with might. We reassembled with purpose.
