 gnoll_flavor.1.title: "Enforcing Loyalty"
 gnoll_flavor.1.desc: "We have received word from our informants and diplomats in [disloyal_subject.GetName] that there is a widespread rebellious spirit in both the common people and rulership. We have no reason to believe that they are planning a revolt, but if we do not stamp out the dissidents quickly and enforce our rule, then the plague of rebellion will only spread. On the other hand, if we show benevolence and kindness to our subjects, this might show them that we are not such cruel overlords after all."

He was then, of course, punished severely for his disrespect toward his superiors.\n\nThe slaver told the story for a laugh - “How could a slave be so insolent?” - but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was not so sure. An individual with such skills could prove extremely valuable to the [Root.GovernmentName].
