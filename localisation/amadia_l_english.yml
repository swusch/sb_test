Like many things in Amadia we must leave our chosen visage to the hands of fate and hope to deal with which we're given."

 amadia.4.t: "A New Name For A Strange Land"
 amadia.4.desc: "Some said we were mad, that the Shuvüüsh have never been a seafaring people. That our destiny laid in the conquest of Haless, not some trans-oceanic farce.\n\nThey were probably right. It was not easy to get to these strange lands, but we were determined. Who was going to tell us no? Travelers spoke of a land rich in gold, damestear, precursor relics and more. Why should these not be ours?\n\nOur storytellers recall our first meetings with the natives, following the Banche caravans inland to the great cities of Lake Chakantu. Perhaps it is these stories, warped beyond all recognition from the journey home, that inspired our great migration. Our ancestors had survived the Husuusing, the Ash March. Now we spoke of the Hekuudsuusing, the Great March. A new home for our people, richer than our wildest dreams.\n\nOf course, it was not quite as great as many had hoped. Our bird companions struggled with the new terrain, while our riders struggled to control them during their constant bickering with the Banche's own seabirds and vultures. Our traditional ways of life, while suitable in the more arid south, were hard to adapt to the jungles that stood between the coast and the wealth inland. Today we sit around fires and ask why we are here, so far from home. But for those who were born here, Haless is a distant concept.\n\nIn our tongue Guwaad means something foreign or strange, and never have we said it more than we do here. Amadia is the name this land has earned in most tongues. It is not known who came up with it first, but our nation here has become known by a new name."
 amadia.4.a: "We are Guwaamadia!"
