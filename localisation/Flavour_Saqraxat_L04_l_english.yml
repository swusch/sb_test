 L04_the_first_clan_seat_title:0 "The First Clan Seat"
 L04_the_first_clan_seat_desc:0 "Saqraxat is governed by its constituent regional clans, who exert power over their territory from fortified settlements, where they also maintain the slave populations of humans and gnolls that work and protect their lands. The clan of Kaa Hava, a stubborn holdout of Noukahi beliefs, currently resides in their fort at Wimxanrit. If their lands were to be thoroughly converted and settled with loyal Elikhetists, they would be able to better administer their territory, and shore up our northern border."

 L04_a_fangaulan_clan_title:0 "A Fangaulan Clan?"
 L04_a_fangaulan_clan_desc:0 "While many of the Mantimatu are true believers in Elikhet’s wisdom, they are still largely foreign to our people. If we are to truly bring them into the fold, they must be incorporated into the clan system, either by elevation or subjugation."
 L04_a_fangaulan_clan_effect_tt:0 "If we complete this mission by accepting §YMantimatu§! culture:"

 L04_a_whetted_appetite_title:0 "A Whetted Appetite"
 L04_a_whetted_appetite_desc:0 "These elusive gnoll shamans have finally been reached. The way to them was paved with the blood of those fiends. Yet they tell me more is needed. The blood of those close to me. Courtiers. Advisors. Confidants. Friends. Their innards will divine the way forward. Reveal the hidden knowledge of how to rid myself of this curse. \n -Excerpt from the Journal of Medaka [Root.Monarch.GetName]"

 L04_exploit_local_auxiliaries_title:0 "Exploit Local Auxiliaries"
 L04_exploit_local_auxiliaries_desc:0 "We are one of the most thoroughly Elikhetist Medasi, yet it would not serve our ambitions if we were to senselessly waste Elikhetist lives in violent warfare, especially against the accursed gnolls. Far better to pay natives to die for us, as, after all, it will make the eventual resettlement of their lands easier when their villages are emptied of fighting men."

 L04_the_split_seat_title:0 "The Split Seat"
 L04_the_split_seat_desc:0 "If we are to annex Kulugiash into our clan structure, then their history of irresolute fence-sitting must be ended. It will no doubt be an arduous task to upend their tradition of moderation in our favor, but the sizable Elikhetist population within their lands must be sheltered under our protection."

 L04_gifts_for_the_new_clans_title:0 "Gifts for the New Clans"
 L04_gifts_for_the_new_clans_desc:0 "Clan hierarchy in Saqraxati society is determined by one measure only: slave ownership. The number of enslaved humans and gnolls held by a clan is the single most important factor in determining their standing within our realm. It only follows naturally that the ruling clan holding authority over all others must own the most slaves to be recognized as legitimate, thus we would do well to expand the markets and holding facilities in the capital. Furthermore, our newly acquired clans would benefit from a generous grant of slaves donated by the government, to increase their standing with their established counterparts while indebting them to ourselves in the process."
 L04_gifts_for_the_new_clans_effect_tt:0 "Every §YClan Seat§! will receive §G2§! Base Manpower and a §YGnollish Minority§!"

 L04_howls_in_the_night_title:0 "Howls in the Night"
 L04_howls_in_the_night_desc:0 "Scouts have been dispatched to nearby gnollish encampments, and an expert on gnoll rituals recently reached the court, but the Medaka’s curse is no closer to being broken. Day after day [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gets more irritable, loosing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wrath on anyone unfortunate enough to perturb [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. It will be necessary to gather more gnollish shamans, by force if needed, to break this hex before it tears the court apart. Curiously, however, the gnolls in our realm have seemed more tranquil as of late. The slaves are less restive, and reports of raids on villages appear less and less at court."
 L04_howls_in_the_night_trigger_tt:0 "The Event §YInfernal Whispers§! has happened"
 L04_howls_in_the_night_effect_tt:0 "§YEvery owned province§! belonging to the §YGnollish§! culture group will lose §G5§! years of separatism"

 L04_refurbish_the_slave_pens_title:0 "Refurbish the Slave Pens"
 L04_refurbish_the_slave_pens_desc:0 "Ilzin Grizaka is no longer. The settlement of Awinkes stands in its place once more. Not long ago, its dank slave pens were crowded by the most unfortunate dregs of humanity. Now, our Khetist brothers and sisters have been freed, and the pens have been made into kennels for their former masters. The town is a thriving nexus for the now fruitful trade in gnollish slaves along the Sorrow, a heartening reversal of a disheartening past."

 L04_the_price_title:0 "The Price..."
 L04_the_price_desc:0 "Our armies, now composed entirely of gnollish slave-soldiers, have ranged across the sub-Salahad, from the blasted sands of the West to the vast savannahs of the East. In their wake they have left bodies and ashes, and all who have met them on the field have been crushed. Every gnoll shaman we have encountered has been captured alive, so that they may be put to righteous work, giving all this slaughter a meaning."
 L04_the_price_trigger_tt:0 "Has razed at least §Y8§! provinces (Currently §Y[Root.GetNumRazedProvinces]/8§!)."

 L04_foul_weather_winds_title:0 "Foul Weather Friends"
 L04_foul_weather_winds_desc:0 "There’s no denying that our diplomatic position is tenuous. Imperial authority in the region has collapsed since the gnollish invasion, leaving us with a powerful and aggressive neighbor to our north, and a host of bickering warlords to our south. To make it through this period, we will need the help of new allies, preferably those who are spiritually aligned with us."
 L04_foul_weather_winds_tt:0 " allies with §Y50§! Improved Relation"
 L04_foul_weather_winds_effect_tt:0 "Every ally that fulfills this mission’s requirement will receive §Y+10§! trust of us."
 L04_foul_weather_winds_effect_tt2:0 "If at least §Y2§! allies are §YElikhetist§! (excluding §Y[U01.GetName]§!):"

 L04_animal_control_title:0 "Animal Control"
 L04_animal_control_desc:0 "Gnolls run rampant on our northern border, slaughtering our herds and making slaves of our people. The situation grows increasingly untenable, and, without substantial reinforcement, runs the risk of fatally destabilizing our realm. Men must be rallied, and the gnolls must be hunted. Captured gnolls can be put to good use in the army, and given to our clans as gifts to ensure their loyalty."

 L04_retribution_title:0 "Retribution"
 L04_retribution_desc:0 "The hour has come for revenge. Revenge on those who broke the greatest empire Sarhal had seen, and severed us from our spiritual center. No longer shall we stand by while gnollish overseers cruelly oppress our Irsmahapan cousins. They must be struck down and expelled from the lands they occupy along the Sorrow."

 L04_new_tricks_title:0 "New Tricks"
 L04_new_tricks_desc:0 "Captured gnolls are not just suitable as merchandise to be sold. Long have they been used on the battlefield, put to use in the most dangerous positions of the frontlines, so that our regulars may live to claim the victory themselves. With the massive influx of gnollish captives, some in our military have begun to wonder if they couldn’t be put to even more uses. What if none of our human subjects had to die at all? What if our vast fields and herds could always remain tended to even in times of war? Perhaps human officers could oversee an army wholly made up of gnollish slave soldiers."

 L04_proliferate_new_clans_title:0 "Proliferate New Clans"
 L04_proliferate_new_clans_desc:0 "With the greater part of Horashesh now brought under our control, we must shape it into a realm worthy of claiming Kheterata’s imperial legacy. The hapless Efergezmu shall be forever barred from the halls of power, so that proper Saqraxati clans may take their place. If we furnish them with proper estates and resources, they will resettle themselves and their slaves southward, finally reigniting the long abandoned colonization efforts forgotten by all but us, which have turned us into the rightful overlords of Horashesh and beyond."

 L04_reconnecting_title:0 "Reconnecting"
 L04_reconnecting_desc:0 "The formerly close ties we had with our Kheteratan lords have been severed by Grizaka’s foul claws, leaving us directionless, and them without the support of their loyal southern vassals. As the most faithful of the Medasi, it's our duty to reforge these bonds, and avert further imperial collapse, especially considering that Kheterata is embroiled in a bitter civil war. And if, as some fear, it may be already too late, then we must do what we can to salvage imperial resources and save Elikhet’s children ourselves."
 L04_reconnecting_trigger_tt:0 "Have §Y+10§! improved relations modifier and §Y+10§! sent gift modifier with Kheterata if they own Kheterat or \n Build §Y25§! spynetwork and insult or viciously mock the owner of Kheterat if they aren't Kheterata."
 L04_reconnecting_effect_tt:0 "If §YKheterata§! owns the province of §YKheterat§!:"

 L04_custodianship_title:0 "Custodianship"
 L04_custodianship_desc:0 "If we are to be recognized as the successors to Kheterata’s legacy south of the Salahad, then we must assume the trappings of legitimacy. Elikhetism must be the supreme faith in our lands, and our Medawor should be preeminent in power among all their peers in Horashesh. If we can match even a mote of venerable Kheterat’s splendour in our own court, then we may be considered worthy enough to carry out her will beyond the southern bend of the Sorrow."
 L04_custodianship_tt:0 "We will retake the §YLost Southern Kheteratan Cores§! owned by §Y[U01.GetName]§! at a cost of §R-2§!£adm£ and §R-2§!£dip£ per point of Development and receive §YPermanent Claims§! on the ones held by §Y[U09.GetName]§!. \n"

 L04_reclamation_title:0 "Reclamation"
 L04_reclamation_desc:0 "Our righteous conquest has returned Irsmahap, entrusted to us by Kheterata, to Khetist hands. Long awaited reunions between families and relatives separated for far too long occur everyday under our new rule. The Irsmahapans should be cleansed of the last stains left from gnollish occupation and returned to the fold. Let us welcome them as our long-lost brethren and subjects of equal standing as we bring prosperity back to their despoiled lands."
 L04_reclamation_modifier_effect_tt:0 "Up to §Y5§! §YIrsmahapan§! cultured provinces we own will receive a random develpment and the modifier '§YReclamation§!' for §Y10 years§!, giving the following effects: \n Local Development Cost: §G-15%§!."

 L04_seat_on_the_sorrow_title:0 "Seat on the Sorrow"
 L04_seat_on_the_sorrow_desc:0 "While the Irsmahapans are our kin, many do cling to dubious convictions in regard to Khetist doctrine. Some of our cultural traditions are also somewhat alien to them. By properly reorganising the culture of our Irsmahapan subjects along the lines of our clan hierarchy, we can truly turn them into an integral part of our realm, divesting them from their misguided beliefs and thus ensuring they may prosper under our rule. The first step in that direction will be to find a suitable Elikhetist family of proper breeding, so that we can raise them up as the High Clan of all Irsmahap."
 L04_seat_on_the_sorrow_tt:0 "A random province fulfilling the requirement will gain the modifier '§YIrsmahapan High Seat§!' \n Local fort maintenance cost: §G-25%§! \n Local garrison size: §G+10%§! \n As well as every province in the state gaining the modifier '§YIrsmahapan High Seat State§!': Local production efficiency §G+20%§! \n Local missionary strength §R+1%§! \n Local governing cost §G-15%§!"

 L04_carrion_to_conquer_title:0 "Carrion to Conquer"
 L04_carrion_to_conquer_desc:0 "The Medasi states are rotten. Having forsaken Kheterata and its imperial grace, they have relinquished their right to rule its former land. With the legitimacy bestowed upon us as bearers of Kheterata’s authority south of the Sorrow, we must display our superiority and reclaim the lands of these wayward subjects."

 L04_old_bonds_renewed_title:0 "Old Bonds Renewed"
 L04_old_bonds_renewed_desc:0 "Many within Kheterata had extensive familial, mercantile, spiritual, and personal bonds with their southern subjects in Horashesh. Likewise, our populace mourns our split from the Kheteratan heartland like a child does a lost parent. We must do whatever is possible to restore this bond, no matter what befalls Kheterata, for we will surely benefit from a restoration of the proper order just as much as them."
 L04_old_bonds_renewed_trigger_tt:0 "Have §Y+25§! improved relations modifier with two rivals of §YKheterat’s Owner§! or §Y+50§! with one."
 L04_old_bonds_renewed_effect_tt:0 "If we complete this mission via alliance with §YKheterata§!:"

 L04_imperial_recognition_title:0 "Imperial Recognition"
 L04_imperial_recognition_desc:0 "Our Medawor are ascendant, our ties to Kheterata stronger than ever, and the portion of the Mother’s Sorrow under our stewardship is resplendent. We should bask in this moment, for truly we are the most righteous sons of Elikhet. Our mandate is clear, we must turn our attention southward, towards the bickering, disgraceful Medasi and return them to their rightful place."
 L04_imperial_recognition_trigger_tt_1:0 " owned provinces along the §YMother's Sorrow§! have:\n   Development at least §Y12§!\n   at least §Y1§! building"

#Government Reform
 saqraxat_pyre_promise:0 "Pyre Promise"
 saqraxat_pyre_promise_desc:0 "The Saqraxati Medasi is bound by an infernal pact, and the legacy of that fateful decision. Certain conquest practices of the Xhazobkult are emulated: the looting and razing of newly conquered territory is almost ritualized. Of course, this is done without any official recognition of its infernal undertones, but the truly devout among our society know better."

#Events
 saqraxat.1.t:0 "Solving the Split"
 saqraxat.1.d:0 "Even before the Kheteratan collapse, the internal politics of Kulugiash were balanced on a knife’s edge. Successive Medakas limited the encroachment of Medawor settlers, in order to maintain the autonomy of the Efergezmu. In turn, they defended the legitimacy of the settlements, and protected them from any revanchist reprisals. This careful balancing act has been maintained for decades, yet its inherent tension continues to simmer under the surface. Now is the time to finally resolve this split in our favor. There will undoubtedly be a backlash in response to our intervention, yet Kulugiash must become an integral part of our domain for all of Saqraxat to thrive. The recalcitrant Efergezmu shall be broken, so that Kulugiash’s Medawor can finally take their place."
 saqraxat.1.a:0 "Enough with this indecisiveness, a firm grip is needed here!"

 saqraxat.2.t:0 "Her Most Privileged Subject"
 saqraxat.2.d:0 "We are the last true vestige of the Kheteratan Empire beyond the Sorrow. Throughout all the chaos caused by Grizaka’s invasion we have remained steadfastly loyal. Loyal to the legacy of Elikhet’s benevolent settlement of Horashesh, and loyal to His guiding vision of what this land could - and should - become. Our dedication has not gone unnoticed, and for our steadfast support in Kheterata’s time of most dire need we shall be duly rewarded."
 saqraxat.2.a:0 "We humbly accept His bounty."

 saqraxat.3.t:0 "An Elikhetist Underground"
 saqraxat.3.d:0 "While Kheterata may be facing perhaps its darkest hour, the light of our faith yet shines bright; a beacon for those who still dream of its legacy. Those true sons and daughters of Elikhet, who chafe under the occupation of the Sorrow, see in us a future for the Elikhetist faith. They flock to our banner: exile and escapee, noble and commoner, young and old, soldier and civilian. In return for our steadfastness, the Sorrow provides her greatest bounty."
 saqraxat.3.a:0 "We will work to receive any who are willing."

 saqraxat.4.t:0 "Contract Catchers"
 saqraxat.4.d:0 "Across Saqraxat, copies of a decree are pinned to inn walls, stone tablets displayed in the town square, and town criers sent shouting. All proclaim the same message:\n“The Medaka will pay a hefty reward in gold for each live gnoll his loyal subjects are able to turn in to the authorities. Be warned: Attempting to turn in already enslaved gnolls with a clan brand will be met with imprisonment and execution.”\nJust days after the decree, parties of all sorts of men began showing up with their catch. Proper, disciplined mercenary companies turned in large batches of gnolls, but even ragtag groups of village dwellers, armed with little more than their farm tools, had risked life and limb to kidnap single gnolls. At first, there were some who tried to turn in gnolls with suspicious scarring over where their brands ought to be, property no doubt stolen from some respectable clan. The perpetrators of such schemes were quickly caught, executed, and strung up for any other would-be thief to see."
 saqraxat.4.a:0 "Let the Adventurers sharpen their swords and bring out their catchpoles."
 saqraxat.4.a.tt:0 "The §YGenerous Quest Rewards§! Adventurer Privilege will be permanently improved by granting §Y+10% Global Manpower Modifier§! and §Y+5% Nobles Loyalty Modifier§!."

 saqraxat.5.t:0 "Infernal Whispers"
 saqraxat.5.d:0 "A sharp, piercing howl echoes across the black savanna, answered by several more in turn. The cries ring in [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s skull, resonating in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very spine. Night after night the same endless howling torments [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. No other member of the court seems to be similarly afflicted, and therefore none grow as agitated from lack of sleep as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\nThis state of affairs cannot continue. All the gnolls within miles of the palace should already have been cleared out by mercenaries. And yet, the howls seem only to reach [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own windows, unnoticeable by anyone else. It clearly must be some sort of foul curse! Probably some spiteful gnoll witch rotting in the prison, casting a demonic hex on [Root.Monarch.GetName]!\nWhen questioned, one of the gnolls languishing in the dungeon finally deigns to speak calmly, unperturbed by the halberds pressed under her throat.\n“This is nothing of my doing, no. This I can assure you. There are other packs, other shamans. Perhaps they have placed this hex on you. But in my dreams I have seen you. Covered in blood. Flanked by fire. Howling. Howling like one of us.”\nThe old gnoll cackles, and soon the entire cell row of prisoners is laughing and howling. Damn them all!"
 saqraxat.5.a:0 "I would kill, maim, and burn for just one sound night’s sleep."

 saqraxat.6.t:0 "Rounding Up Hounds"
 saqraxat.6.d:0 "With the reconquest of parts of the Middle Sorrow, Saqraxati slave patrols have become a common sight along the river. Riverboats pass each other going both up and downstream, conveying both patrols and their misbegotten goods to their destinations. Our activity has of course been quite disruptive towards the local gnollish populace, and some of these unruly dogs have started stirring up the packs to revolt."
 saqraxat.6.a:0 "Time to enforce the leash."

 saqraxat.7.t:0 "A Simple Bargain"
 saqraxat.7.d:0 "“I was so foolish. This curse is more than an annoyance. It’s an opportunity. A call. Those witches have made the matter clear to me.”\nThe Medaka stands before a ritual circle. Gnoll shamans, bound in manacles, lay out bones and candles in intricate patterns under the watchful eye of their guards. A coterie of anxious advisors and courtiers stand around, nervously looking back between the eerily silent Medaka and the gnoll’s feverish preparations. All at once the Medaka steps forward and the shamans back away. Curiously, their guards now subtly usher the group towards the circle.\nA ritual was performed, and an offering made. Blood was taken, and more was promised."
 saqraxat.7.a:0 "An infernal brand, glowing in emerald light, reminds the Medaka of that promise."

 saqraxat.8.t:0 "The Dogs of War"
 saqraxat.8.d:0 "From [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] vantage point, the Medaka peered over the force arrayed before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. If [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] squinted, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could almost convince [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] that the gnolls were lined up in ranks that could generously be described as “disciplined.” Their human officers certainly did their best to keep them in line, and the assembled force as a whole was almost eerily silent compared to your typical gnollish raiding party."
 saqraxat.8.a:0 "Perhaps they truly can replace human soldiers on the front lines."

 saqraxat.9.t:0 "The Price of Power"
 saqraxat.9.d:0 "A grand set of concentric ritual circles was prepared, dwarfing the previous one. Its construction has taken days, which the thousands of gnolls gathered have spent feasting and slaughtering. Their numbers seem to have multiplied, the initial group brought along with the Medaka having been bolstered by new arrivals from Elikhet knows where. At night strange, unholy sounds have been heard from the farthest edges of the gnollish camps, shrieks of brutal ecstasy inextricably merged with agony -- certainly not of this plane. Such activity has deeply disconcerted the Medaka’s advisors, who have spent as much time as possible holed up within their tents.\nThe long-awaited hour has finally come, though. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands on a platform before the central circle, quietly cackling with madness flickering in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] reddened eyes gaze upon the sight before them: thousands of sacrifices await their fate within the circles, human and gnoll alike. Green flames lick at the platform’s base as an uneasy quiet descends on the sordid camp. The witches at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sides wrap [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in ironwood chains, and usher [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] towards the pyre that has been fed with oh so many bodies. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] must pass through the fire to gain the incredible power [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was promised. Ten thousand pairs of eyes fix on [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] steps before the pyre, the ground begins to shake.\nA terrible grating noise, as if the bones of the earth were grinding each other to dust, begins as shrieks erupt from all around the pyre. Within the too-black smoke, faint green eyes begin to shine in an otherworldly light.\n“Fool of a human.” The writhing smoke surged forth. “Entire empires have been offered in my name, and here you stand before me with naught but a few thousand wretched souls. And your soft, weak flesh.” Torrents of flame burst forth from the pyre. In an instant, they wrap around the Medaka, yanking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] into the fire, which explodes into a pillar of fell flame, immediately burning away the innermost tent rings. A raspy cackling sounds, as if from the earth itself, and chaos overtakes the site."
 saqraxat.9.a:0 "The faithful may stand appalled, yet the hounds bray for blood."
 saqraxat.9.a.tt:0 "While §YLet Slip the Hounds§! lasts, the modifier can be §Gextended§! for §Y+1 Year§! every time you §RRaze§! a province!"

 saqraxat.10.t:0 "To Remake Horoshesh in our Image"
 saqraxat.10.d:0 "A new day dawns in Horashesh. Peasants and slaves toil in the field. Goat and cattle herds lazily graze on their pastures. Children learn to recite the list of Khetarchs. A squad of gnolls is set upon a recalcitrant native for refusing to bow to a statue of divine Elikhet.\nA new day dawns in Horashesh. Merchants hawk their wares in the marketplace. Delta gnomes from far away Koroshesh make deals with halfling traders from Fahvanosy. A father buys a golden statuette of Elikhet, a gift to his newlywed daughter. Howls and barks are heard from the dank recesses of the slave pens.\nA new day dawns in Horashesh. A Horashesh of our own making, unquestionable evidence of Elikhet’s favor. Here, proud Elikhetist clans administer their new lands and subjects in accordance with His teachings, with us, the faithful Saqraxati, first among them."
 saqraxat.10.a:0 "At last, the fulfillment of His vision for Horashesh is within our grasp!"
 saqraxat.10.tt.1:0 "Every owned province in the §YHorashesh Region§! producing grain or livestock gains the following effect:"
 saqraxat.10.tt.2:0 "Farm Estate is replaced with Trade Company"
 saqraxat.10.tt.3:0 "from the production of all our provinces."

 saqraxat.11.t:0 "In Their Time of Need"
 saqraxat.11.d:0 "Kheterata, our former liege and blessed Steward of the Sorrow, now faces its darkest hour. Still reeling from the gnollish invasion they recently endured, they now have to contend with traitors seeking to usurp the throne of the rightful Steward. It is our most sacred duty as a Medasi to provide what aid we can now to stave off their total collapse. Even if our aid does not suffice and the worst should come to pass, it will surely be of great use to those loyal sons and daughters who may have to persist under traitors and demon-crazed gnolls. We shall provide Kheterata with..."
 saqraxat.11.a:0 "... some of our very best officers."
 saqraxat.11.b:0 "... officers and a detachment of troops."
 saqraxat.11.c:0 "Actually, let us leverage the Medaka’s connections."

 saqraxat.13.t:0 "The Sacking of Zuvavim"
 saqraxat.13.d:0 "The many-tiered walls of Zuvavim’s old halfling city are crumbling into the sea. Burning hulks now populate her famous harbor, the countless merchant vessels and warships looted and smoldering. Save for those of the loyal Khetist Steelwind Fleet, of course. Having ferried in our soldiers during the siege, they now pledge their ships to our cause, even if they were more than a little off put when brigades of our gnolls boarded their vessels. Out of the famous two fleets of Zuvavim now only one remains and the dream of a Zuvavim shared between Medawor and Efergezmu is left on the seafloor with the wrecks of the Sunsail Fleet."
 saqraxat.13.a:0 "The Bay of Lel will be a Khetist sea once more."

 #Iqhekabi
 saqraxat.14.t:0 "Broken Tusks"
 saqraxat.14.d:0 "Iqhekabi and her proud elephants have long served as a symbol of native resistance to Khetist authority. No longer. Our armies have ransacked the city, and slaughtered their vaunted herds. The elephant graveyards, holy sites for the local superstitious cults, have been desecrated, the bones of generations of elephants dug up to be used as mere raw material for our craftsmen. To their dismay, much of the ivory and bone would only arrive after being gnawed upon by countless gnoll jaws."
 saqraxat.14.a:0 " Let all of Horashesh fear us."

 saqraxat.15.t:0 "Scouring Golonela"
 saqraxat.15.d:0 "The wealth of the hilltop city of Golonela is well concealed. Countless Kheteratan tax assessors were historically frustrated by the inhabitants’ skill in concealing their true wealth. But now that our army has broken the city’s defenses, rooting out any resistance holdouts and dragging its notables from their hiding spots, we have free reign to finally balance the ledgers. No household will go untouched, every ounce of gold, jewelry and coinage will be looted, and their outstanding debt shall finally be paid."
 saqraxat.15.a:0 "We have far better uses for their riches."

 #Chibuswa
 saqraxat.16.t:0 "A Step too Far"
 saqraxat.16.d:0 "“The City of Beauty” is the famous moniker of Chibuswa. Most called it such for the fine manors, rich architecture, or splendid glasswork. We however recognized Chibuswa for its spiritual and cultural purity. It was perhaps the only city in all of Horashesh which could truly boast of a genuine Horakheti identity. A resplendent example of what loyal Khetist subjects could accomplish if truly devoted to the cause, it was reminiscent of the Sorrow’s own magnificence.\nNow, it lies in ruins. The same gnollish armies that delivered Horashesh to us have tarnished its most admirable part. Our blood-crazed hounds have razed the city, looted its noble estates, and destroyed all that truly set it apart as exemplary of the Horakheti ideal."
 saqraxat.16.a:0 "Let us mourn this tragic setback on Elikhet’s path for Horashesh."

 #Bivuzena
 saqraxat.17.t:0 "An Anticlimax"
 saqraxat.17.d:0 "It's hard to imagine why such a disastrous war had once been fought for Bivuzena. The city is fairly populous, but otherwise by no measure remarkable. It pales in comparison to Kheterat, yet thousands have spent their lives in futile conflict over controlling it. Now, by the tooth and claw of our gnollish armies, we are the ones in control."
 saqraxat.17.a:0 "Just another city among the rest."

 saqraxat.18.t:0 "The Triumph of Gamyi"
 saqraxat.18.d:0 "The towering shard that looms over Gamyi has long been considered a symbol of strength for the non-believers. The site where their hero Kui once declared himself divine now has fallen in the hands of Elikhet’s faithful. As it is much too large and sturdy to dismantle, it will instead be repurposed to serve as a new symbol of Khetist authority over Horashesh. Those too stubborn and defiant to accept Elikhet’s light into their hearts will be brought before the tower to be judged, so they may finally begin to understand Kui's weakness."
 saqraxat.18.a:0 "The Hero, humbled."

 #NyoKyora
 saqraxat.19.t:0 "The Stores of the Scale-Skinners"
 saqraxat.19.d:0 "Of all the misguided Medasi, the Ikilshebe rulers of Nyokyora were perhaps the most deserving of a modicum of respect. Although, like their kin to the north, stubbornly devoted to their hero worship and a host of dubious ritual practices that came with it, they excelled in warfare and conquest against the lizardfolk. They continually chipped away at the lizardfolk demesnes in the south, settling the land with their own people instead. Kheterata surely benefitted from their vigilant service in the past, and, had they been more devoted to the true faith, perhaps we could have found an ally in the Ikilshebe. Alas, the stores of lizardscale armour within their capital’s armories will serve us instead."
 saqraxat.19.a:0 "A further boon to our ever victorious armies."

 saqraxat.27.d:0 "This is the **hidden** event that chooses what aid you'll receive.\n\nYou may be seeing this because you loaded a save game and the event happened to occur on the same day."
 saqraxat.27.a:0 "You're not supposed to be seeing this event!"

 saqraxat.28.t:0 "Volunteers from the Faithful"
 saqraxat.28.d:0 "The low earthen walls and modest furnishings of the royal estate in Saqraxat may only be comparable to some of the more modest noble estates along the heart of the Sorrow, but to Nazem they shone like a gilded palace. After having travelled all the way south from Kheterat, even a village inn would have seemed luxurious. Saqraxat, however, represented much more than just the final destination of his arduous journey. It was a new frontier, a place of opportunity, where glory could be won in service of the expansion of Elikhet’s domain."
 saqraxat.28.a:0 "Valiant volunteers join our ranks."

 saqraxat.29.t:0 "A Generous Donation"
 saqraxat.29.d:0 "Our newly regained connection with Kheterata has seen to it that word about our continued mission of furthering the cause of Khetism in Horashesh has spread amongst our brethren to the north. Evidently, supporting our endeavours has become something of a cause célèbre among many of the Kheteratan nobility. Just this month, a sizable gift of gold was brought to our court, addressed from a list of various noble houses. Curiously, the messengers sent with the gold made special note of houses which chose not to contribute, and humbly requested our Medaka send them back with messages praising the generosity of those who did."
 saqraxat.29.a:0 "This politicking will at least benefit our pockets."

 saqraxat.30.t:0 "Devout Courtier Arrives"
 saqraxat.30.d:0 "A courtier, hailing from hallowed Kheterat itself, arrived at the palace today accompanied by their splendid entourage. They spoke before the court of having experienced a dream, containing a message from divine Elikhet, that it was His will that they travel to our lands. They claim to have seen the face of our Medaka, and understood that it was their duty to aid [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by devoting all their meagre skills to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cause. They are even perfectly willing to accept relatively sparse furnishings, especially compared to the splendor they likely gave up to be here, if only they were allowed to fulfill their divine mission."
 saqraxat.30.a:0 "A welcome addition."
 L04_devout_courtier_tt:0 "A random advisor arrives at our court. This advisor will be §G50%§! cheaper to employ."

 saqraxat.31.t:0 "A Legacy of War"
 saqraxat.31.d:0 "If one word could describe his feelings, it was humiliation. He felt humiliated and indignant…and frustrated. His entire service to Kheterata had seen his homeland face defeat time and time again. No longer would he stake his reputation on those who would just fail him once more. Instead, he would strike out on his own and fight in Elikhet’s name under a new banner. Out on the frontiers of the faith, where his only enemies would be the feeble armies of the hapless Medasi, where he could make a real difference. Yes, Saqraxat would be where he shall lay the foundations of his legacy."
 saqraxat.31.a:0 "An experienced general to lead our armies? Exactly what we need!"

 saqraxat.32.t:0 "Bureaucratic Bolstering"
 saqraxat.32.d:0 "When our first envoys and carts of supplies had reached Kheterat, many of the imperial administrators were stunned to receive a message from the South, having assumed us long fallen to gnolls and barbarism, severed from the imperial heartland as we were. Naturally, they leapt at the opportunity to bring us back into the fold properly, and help us reestablish an efficient bureaucracy in our territory. Sure enough, after the requisite motions had been filed and approved in triplicate, a cadre of tax assessors, archivists, accountants, and the like soon made the journey south."
 saqraxat.32.a:0 "Our administration will surely benefit."

 saqraxat.33.t:0 "Diplomatic Delegation"
 saqraxat.33.d:0 "Evidently, not all within Kheterata have so easily given up on the imperial vision for Horashesh. A somewhat influential court faction still devoted to the vision of a Kheterata stretching from the Divenhal to the Sea of Lel has sent some of their loyal servants to our capital. These experienced diplomats graciously relinquished their positions within the Kheteratan administration to support the cause of our humble realm. They are dogged negotiators, seasoned from navigating countless court intrigues in Kheterata, and will surely be diligent representatives of the Elikhetist faith and Kheteratan culture to our wayward subjects."
 saqraxat.33.a:0 "What splendid servants of the faith."

 saqraxat.34.t:0 "Military Muster"
 saqraxat.34.d:0 "Not every soul which travels south from Kheterata is necessarily a zealous volunteer for our cause; some have simpler desires. We cast no judgement of course, as their services are still useful. One such group is a collective of progressive military minds from Kheterata’s younger officer ranks. They seek merely to test out the ingenious and unorthodox tactics and strategies they’ve personally developed, and see the tumultuous conflict-ridden region of Horashesh as the perfect environment for honing their military acumen."
 saqraxat.34.a:0 "Bold men to fashion an army of the future."

 saqraxat.35.t:0 "Settlers from the Sorrow"
 saqraxat.35.d:0 "Unfortunately, the turmoil which has gripped Kheterata since their latest collapse has displaced and dispossessed many. These poor souls seek a new beginning, a safe home, and a means to provide food for their families. In these dark times they have recalled tales of a brighter vision of Kheterata, a tale of Elikhetist settlements spreading throughout Horashesh. Fortunately for them, we have preserved that vision and stayed true to our faith, and can thus offer them a fresh start in our lands. Already, brave settlers have begun streaming across our borders, eager to join the cause."
 saqraxat.35.a:0 "For Elikhet!"

 saqraxat.36.t:0 "Southern Officers"
 saqraxat.36.d:0 "Saqraxat, one of the most thoroughly Khetist of our former Medasi in Horashesh, had for many years been a most faithful subject. Tragically, their connection to our domain was severed by Grizaka’s claws. Now, however, they have proved their loyalty again by sending us a group of officers to aid in our civil war!"
 saqraxat.36.a:0 "Splendid."
 saqraxat.36.a.tt:0 "This modifier will be §Rpermanently lost§! when you're at peace."

 saqraxat.37.d:0 "Saqraxat, one of the most thoroughly Khetist of our former Medasi in Horashesh, had for many years been a most faithful subject. Tragically, their connection to our domain was severed by Grizaka’s claws. Now, however, they have proved their loyalty again by sending us a group of officers and a detachment of troops to aid in our civil war!"
 saqraxat.37.a:0 "Splendid."

 saqraxat.38.t:0 "Welcome Surprise"
 saqraxat.38.d:0 "Saqraxat, one of the most thoroughly Khetist of our former Medasi in Horashesh, had for many years been a most faithful subject. Tragically, their connection to our domain was severed by Grizaka’s claws. Now, however, they have proved their loyalty again by purchasing for us a company of mercenaries to defeat Nirat!"
