 ce_orcs_with_a_heart_title:0 "Orcs with a Heart"
 ce_orcs_with_a_heart_desc:0 "Our former chieftain, Grama Clouded Eye, once told us something important: "No war is quite as stupid as one fought between those of a like mind." That is precisely the sort of fate that awaits us if we fall into conflict with the orcs of Heartgrinder, who are just as cynical of the Dookanson as we are. Let us therefore take decisive action to ensure good relations with our Heartgrinder brethren. Have a heart-to-heart with them, as it were."

 ce_pen_and_axe_desc:0 "Closed-minded and ignorant fools on many fronts accuse us of the same thing. Whether it is the shamans of the witless "Great Dookan" or the Vernman or Lorentish bandits, they all have the same opinion. To these would-be enslavers of our people, whom Grama of exalted memory worked so hard to defy, being an orc is to be unable to think for oneself. It is to lack subtlety or an appreciation for strategy or long term thought.\n\nThe fact is that those oppressors are wrong. We are not merely capable of independent thought: we can engage in diplomacy and negotiation too. We are even able to win battles without a single sword being drawn. Let us prove that today."

 ce_the_esshyl_deal_title:0 "The Esshyl Deal"
 ce_the_esshyl_deal_desc:0 "We have heard rumblings from our Heartgrinder brethren that Esshyl is increasingly becoming a nuisance to govern. Some of them even suggest outright handing the province over to our control in exchange for much-needed gold from our home of Gulenhyl. This is a wise suggestion and we do well to go along with it. Let us arrange the Esshyl purchase and thereby strengthen our relations with Heartgrinder."

 ce_southern_bulwark_title:0 "Southern Bulwark"
 ce_southern_bulwark_desc:0 "To the south are the violent humans of Marrhold. These Marrodics are fond of griffons to an extent that we find rather concerning. They also have a frothing, murderous hatred for our people and have repeatedly attacked our borders. Now that we have control over Esshyl, we have an opportunity to defend against these would-be conquerors. Let us fortify the new province so as to deny Marrhold freedom of movement in our southern regions."

 ce_codified_warrior_tradition_title:0 "Orcish Knights"
 ce_codified_warrior_tradition_desc:0 "Combat against settled societies, whether Castellyrian or Marrodic, inevitably came with difficulties. Years of ingrained discipline made it so that even their peasant levies were difficult for our soldiers to surmount except through sheer brute force. These days, however, we know better than to waste the lives of our citizens on suicidal charges. We need to professionalize our soldiers so more can come home alive and to ensure they can compete with our neighbors' armies as equals."

 ce_the_ruined_city_title:0 "The Ruined City"
 ce_the_ruined_city_desc:0 "Heading west towards Humacvord and Castonath we find the ruins of the Ardent Keep, a major fortress of the ancient Castanorian empire. Said Keep fell to ruin, but only the structures were lost—the fundamentals that made it such a bustling settlement in ages long past are still there. As we of Clouded Eye transition away from the quasi-nomadic way of life that was the norm, we should seriously consider settling the Ardent Keep and making it our own."

 ce_justice_for_lothane_title:0 "Justice for Lothane"
 ce_justice_for_lothane_desc:0 ""Death to the Bladebreaker scum!" This sort of thought—though usually conveyed in a far less prolific manner—is commonplace among the orcs of Clouded Eye ever since the return of Arosha Oakbreaker. Arosha, a member of Corin's Circle earlier in the century, was a colleague of Grandmaster Lothane Silmuna of the Corintar. She was therefore aware of the brutality to which the Bluetusk was subject at the hands of the Bladebreakers; she might have been able to tolerate it had it just been Lothane, but those bastards had to go and murder all half-orcs for good measure.\n\nThe existence of Bladebreaker as an independent tribe is a blight on Escann that must be burned away. We will render justice to Lothane and his slain brethren and build a better society on the ashes of Bladebreaker."

 ce_the_remnant_title:0 "The Remnant"
 ce_the_remnant_desc:0 "The Count's League is a remnant of an empire about as meritless as the hell that the Dookanson wanted to establish. Arrogant out of all proportion to their virtue or strength, they unceasingly insist on long-dead ritual "proprieties". These fools are seemingly completely unaffected in mind or soul by the collapse of the empire, of which they themselves are guilty. Why should such an existence be permitted to blight the good people of the new Escann?\n\nThe Chieftain has decreed it. This day the legacy of Castellyr shall be obliterated, and the nobles dethroned. The Castellyrian people shall become part and parcel of our own people to build a legacy superior to the rubbish that came before."
 ce_the_remnant.tt:0 "§RSome nobles refuse to bend the knee to me. I will make them.§!\n"

 ce_a_new_people_title:0 "A New People"
 ce_a_new_people_desc:0 "When Lothane Bluetusk was young, all were forced to lead a brutish existence. Orcs and humans did not meet except in conflict. War was the defining characteristic of existence, and the half-orcs that emerged were results of such cruel struggles. Treated as abominations by the races that gave birth to them, they were ruthlessly brutalized and exterminated.\n\nToday, on the other hand, in an atmosphere of order, progress, and mutual understanding, orcs and humans exist as equals. This equality has progressed to such an extent that orc-human weddings and couplings are now commonplace—so much so, in fact, that a new and modern half-orcish people has taken hold in the Oldhaven on which the moronic counts once squatted."

 ce_gramas_last_conquest_title:0 "Grama's Last Conquest"
 ce_gramas_last_conquest_desc:0 "Our Chieftain, Grama, feels the pressure of age weakening her as time wears on—but she is still able to plan a campaign as well as anyone else. Befitting her diplomatic mettle and accounting for the damage time has done to her, she proposes an offensive against Dogeater.\n\nThe tribe of Dogeater is as foolhardy as their name suggests—who but them, be they orc or any other race, would be foolish enough to consume dogs? References to this fact among others that combine to make Dogeater an embarrassment among even orcs should suffice to shatter their alliances the moment we cross our borders."

 ce_gramas_last_speech_title:0 "Grama's Last Speech"
 ce_gramas_last_speech_desc:0 ""My people—the people of Clouded Eye! I am growing old. My eyes are as clouded as our tribe's sigil—on a bad day there are times when I can't tell one of you apart from another. We have struggled through so much together, my people. I feel ashamed of what I must tell you next."\n\n"It's time for me to move on. I want to live a more ordinary life free of the strains of governance. Fortunately, we will not have to go through the usual squabbling over succession: a meritorious candidate has emerged in my visions. My people, meet your new chief: Arosha Oakbreaker.""

 ce_lothanes_letters_title:0 "Lothane's Letters"
 ce_lothanes_letters_desc:0 ""I am carrying a written conversation with my comrade and, as it were, extremely distant kinsman Lothane Bluetusk. It helps to have such people as the Grandmaster of the Corintar to converse with, considering the stringency of our task as the leaders of our respective peoples."\n\n"However, with how overextended Lothane can get at times, I do worry something might go wrong. I hope he doesn't end up somehow mixing up his papers...""

 ce_coins_with_orcish_face_title:0 "Coins with an Orcish Face"
 ce_coins_with_orcish_face_desc:0 "In the past our tendency has been to use fragments of gold to trade with our compatriots and neighbors. But foreigners—even the Corintar at times—have tended to treat this currency with distrust. What is more irritating is the fact that some ... enterprising orcs have tried to pass off fool's gold—pyrite—as currency despite Gulenhyl being right there.\n\nThis issue should not be permitted to fester any longer. There are clear social and economic advantages to standardized coinage. Let us, therefore, mint coins with the face of our chieftain and the sigil of our people on them, and hold them to strict standards."

 ce_our_first_city_title:0 "Our First City"
 ce_our_first_city_desc:0 "Ardent Keep has proven worthy of its name. By attaining control over it we are now in possession of an advantageous location with a wealth of resources available in all directions; it is a truly suitable home for our people.\n\nSince our emergence from Gulenhyl there has been a constant low-level debate on what to do with the seat of our government. There used to be suggestions that we remain in Gulenhyl itself or settle Oldhaven, but these have gone silent since. The only suggestion now is what we ourselves are beginning to suggest: that Ardent Keep become our capital."

 ce_children_of_greentide_title:0 "Children of the Greentide"
 ce_children_of_greentide_desc:0 "Lothane Bluetusk and his ragged band of half-orcish kinsmen were a leading indicator of a broader trend that emerged in Escann in the late Greentide era. At first—O shame!—perforce and eventually of their own free will, orcs and humans began to live together and bear offspring.\n\nAs is evident from the life experience of Grandmaster Silmuna, a half-orc combines many of the biological and intellectual advantages of both races. We of Clouded Eye are beginning to benefit from this as a distinct population of half-orcs emerges in our lands."

 ce_green_city_title:0 "The Green City"
 ce_green_city_desc:0 "Ottrac of Ár Úrion, a Castellyrian noble allied to our people and hostile to the Blacktowers, recently arrived in Kutotash to report to the Chieftain. The first thing he said was "My eyes boggle. It seems that we have managed to surpass the Ardent Keep as my father remembered it. It is bathed in a green hue, if you will, but it is just as beautiful as it once was."\n\nSome minutes later his face visibly curdled. "There's something else we have brought back, I fear. Bureaucrats." The Chieftain chuckled, grimly sympathetic. "I know; it's a fate worse than death.""

 ce_fortifying_white_walls_title:0 "Fortifying the White Walls"
 ce_fortifying_white_walls_desc:0 "A city, be it orcish or human, is nothing more than a lamb waiting for slaughter if it cannot defend itself. Fortunately, the ancients had the same idea and built a large line of fortifications in our region—the White Walls of Castanor.\n\nKutotash and Gulenhyl must be defended, lest the Marrodics or other threats assault us while we are at unawares. We should use the White Walls as a model and integrate them into our own fortifications."

 ce_last_letter_from_queen_arosha_title:0 "Arosha's Last Letter"
 ce_last_letter_from_queen_arosha_desc:0 "The following is transcribed from the last directive of Queen Arosha Oakbreaker in her role as our Queen: "...My people, I understand now what our late Chieftain, Lady Grama, meant by a sense of 'deep fatigue'. I also see what is meant by a younger and more energetic generation pressing forward to guide our people. I find it best to act in sympathy with the times and allow myself to depart in peace by immediately abdicating the throne of the nation and placing my grandson in charge to govern us. I will still be there to support him—and all of you—but he will hold the reins of state. I hope you all can support him as you did me.""

 ce_no_more_raids_title:0 "No More Raids"
 ce_no_more_raids_desc:0 "One of the great degeneracies brought about by the corruptive influence of the so-called god Dookan and his imbecilic pretend son Korgus was raiding. Though orcs as a race are just as capable of taking care of themselves without committing theft, many of our fellows listened to the siren call of cruel stupidity and raided left, right, and center, at times not even sparing orcs from their depredations.\n\nWorst of all in this respect were the Dogeater clan, whom we have rooted out. Their brutishness will not be permitted to survive. We have moved on, and we will march into a future without raiding—and without any Dogeaters that do not comply."

 ce_fields_of_green_title:0 "Fields of Green"
 ce_fields_of_green_desc:0 ""We do not sow," the Dookanson once insisted. Death to that foolishness! Why should we steal food, when we can produce our own food and sustain ourselves? Why do we need the produce of others when the territory we have settled is so fertile?\n\nWe have a remarkably effective method of planting "three-sisters" fields. Let us put it to use to increase the productivity of these new lands above and beyond what their old owners could achieve. In this manner the fields once blighted by the competing diktats of Castellos and Dookan will be green once again."

 ce_dargom_ascendant_title:0 "Dargom Ascendant"
 ce_dargom_ascendant_desc:0 "Ours is a Dargom polity—an urbanized, civilized state predicated upon a suitable mixture between traditionally orcish methods and the ways of the past. We have created great cities for ourselves and are beginning to benefit from the advancements that the accursed Dookanson would have had us destroy.\n\nCivilized, enlightened Dargom like us have at least ninety-nine tasks to confront at any given time, and listening to Korgus-worshipping thieving bumpkins like the Ozdan is not one of them. We will march forward as Dargom and forsake the barbarism of the past."

 ce_standardize_ungulan_dialect_title:0 "Standardize Ungulan"
 ce_standardize_ungulan_dialect_desc:0 "Orcs arriving from other polities sometimes find themselves as lost as friendly humans coming to live here when they hear our people speak. The language spoken in the likes of Kutotash or Gulenhyl has by now clearly diverged from the general orcish language that Korgus used to boss his servants around.\n\nWe have some scholars and bureaucrats without a clear assignment at the moment. Let us put them to use to standardize this dialect we speak into a proper written language."

 ce_grama_academy_title:0 "Grama Academy"
 ce_grama_academy_desc:0 "Kondunn has become a gathering place for shamans and other learned people. It was where our late Chieftain, Grama Clouded Eye, most liked to while away her days both during and after her rule. On her watch the town of Kondunn became a place for freethought and innovation, as well as religious disputation.\n\nLet us therefore build a shamanic and magical academy here in Kondunn so as to honor Chieftain Grama. Let it be open to all those who seek learning, and to learn the mysteries of our past and scry our way forward."

 ce_utilizing_clouded_eye_title:0 "Utilizing the Clouded Eye"
 ce_utilizing_clouded_eye_desc:0 "It might not have been obvious to most but we are not called Clouded Eye because of some genetic predisposition to blindness. In fact we have this name because of our possession of a sacred relic known as the Clouded Eye, which was what consolidated us into a single people around Grama Clouded Eye and her predecessors.\n\nThis Clouded Eye allows us to engage in truly effective divination. It is therefore useful to lend heft to the name of Grama Academy among orcs and foreigners alike. To prove our case, let us begin by divination in respect to our own future."

 ce_first_orc_kingdom_title:0 "The First Orc Kingdom"
 ce_first_orc_kingdom_desc:0 "We made pretensions to the title of "kingdom" before but now it is very clear. We are now the first and most prominent orcish kingdom in Escann or in Cannor writ large. We sit as rulers and guides to the whole of orckind.\n\nThere is one small impediment to our status, however. It is somewhat unwieldy for us to rely on the mere possession of a magical relic for our identity. The name of Unguldavor is beginning to take hold as a name for the lands under our control. Perhaps we may be well served to adopt it."

 flavor_clouded_eye.1.t:0 "Grama's Last Speech"
 flavor_clouded_eye.1.d:0 "Legions of orcs were gathered around the Gulenhyl longhouse for an important speech. Several orcish warriors, carrying their axes and wearing their armor, stood at attention. The sound of horns drew the orcs to attention as an elderly female orc exited the longhouse. Her black hair had gone gray a long time ago and her slumped posture was imposed on her by her advanced age. She used a staff as a cane to lean on as two elite warriors flanked her. Grama was not a typical orc chieftain. Instead of being middle-aged and muscular, she was old, frail, and blind. But the Clouded Eye clan was not like other clans. Where the other clans prioritized physical strength, Clouded Eye proudly proclaimed wisdom as the real strength. In that sense, Grama was the strongest chieftain of all the Greentide clans.\n\nGrama coughed, earning the immediate attention of the orcs present. “My children,” she started as she addressed the crowd, “I have come to talk about the prophecy I saw all those years ago. We have followed Dookanson out of the Serpentspine to attack those accursed humans whose gods chained Dookan. We were the glue that kept our holy war from falling apart before reaching the White Walls. We were the tacticians who turned Rottenstep from a defeat into a death trap for the humans who tried to take what was rightfully ours. And it was us who went to claim these hills filled with gold when our savior was slain.”\n\nGrama coughed into her hand, seeing blood stain her green, wrinkled skin. She knew she didn’t have much time left. The shamans told her in private that she only had a few months left to live. An invisible foe was killing her, one that not even the most trained healers could stop.\n\nShe wiped her hand subtly on her dress before continuing, “It has been an honor to lead the Clouded Eye clan and act as the hands of Dookan. It is with great sorrow that I announce that as of tomorrow, I will no longer be chieftain. I will delegate to the Council of Shamans to manage succession. The Clouded Eye has shown me that if I was to remain chieftain until my inevitable passing, that our great clan would perish as one of the many clans to fall to the humans.” She pointed to a passing procession of enslaved humans captured from Dogeater.\n\nGrama raised her hands, drawing everyone’s attention. “My children, I’ll leave you off with one last phrase:"

 flavor_clouded_eye.2.d:0 "“On [GetYear], I finished my wandering across Escann. Lothane begged me to stay with him and help build up the community in Ionntras, but my place was not with him. Though Corin was our guiding light, his place was with the humans. My place was with my people, the orcs. Ever since Korgus murdered my father, mother, and older brother, I have been an outcast, the last chieftain of the Oakbreaker Clan. Unfortunately, I saw my fellow orcs as next unless action was taken.\n\nI arrived at Gulenhyl. Several Ozarm’chadashes happened, with several already dead. I pulled by axe and hopped into the arena. The other contenders tried to stop me, but I learned lessons from Corin, Lothane, and the others. One by one, I sent them sprawled on the ground.\n\nOnce the shamans declared me as the new chieftain of Clouded Eye. With a bellow, I announced, ‘Orcs of Clouded Eye, lend me your ears!’ I was greeted by jeers and boos, but it was to be expected. I was indirectly responsible for the bastard, Korgus, being killed by Corin. But it didn’t matter. They’d learn to love me. ‘I know several of you know me as the traitor, the girl from the disgraced Oakbreaker clan. But I’m here to pose you a question: is Korgus not the real traitor? Corin killed him, a human girl a few years younger than me killed an all-powerful warrior who was supposed to be the son of our god. I am not going to go so far as to say Dookan is not our god, but rather that Korgus peddled a lie. Korgus is no hero, he’s a monster! He lied to us and manipulated Grama’s vision! However, what is done can’t be undone.\n\n‘We have been left with this tract of ruins to rebuild. While Grama was wise to bring us here, away from the marcher lords, we cannot afford to be complacent. Already, marchers are approaching Castonath. In order to preserve our independence and traditions, we must adapt! We need to build a modern state out of this wilderness and position ourselves as the strongest nation in Escann.’\n\nThe crowd cheered me on. Never before had I seen so much love, acceptance, and enthusiasm. Some zealots weren’t happy about my denunciation of Korgus and left the camp, but that wasn’t too important for me at the time. If I played my cards right, I’d be able to secure a future for the orcs.”\n\n- Arosha Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 1: Arrival at Gulenhyl"

 flavor_clouded_eye.3.t:0 "Letter from Lothane"
 flavor_clouded_eye.3.d:0 "“Upon being blessed by the shamans, I got into correspondence with Lothane in Corintar. We exchanged letters to each other in Common. The topics were as wide as discussing foreign affairs to something as simple as romance. Lothane talked about his wife, a kindly human woman who showed more interest in housekeeping than in warfare. I, meanwhile, told him that I was holding off until I found the perfect man. Lothane talks about his uncle, Rogier, and their correspondence. I, meanwhile, gave him the updates on Bladebreaker that my spies were receiving.\n\nIt was a rainy afternoon when the scribe ran in carrying a letter. I was expecting it to be another letter from Lothane about his young sons. However, upon opening the letter, I discovered it wasn’t about Lothane’s family, or even written by him. Instead, I was greeted by the following lines:\n\n‘Ionntras: 20,000 residents - 20 gold\nWystanway: 10,000 residents - 10 gold\nHumac’s Rest: 1,000 residents - 1 gold\n\nSummary: Taxes are expected to remain low until we can establish control and end the chaos.’\n\nThe letter went on to discuss tax codes and building regulations. This mistake brought some new insight.\n\nOver the next few months, Lothane sent over copies of tax codes and law books, carefully omitting any sensitive information. I slowly learned how humans ran their countries and how it was these laws and rules that provided a state with income, structure, and the resources to field armies, build cities, and survive.\n\nBy the time we returned to more personal letter, I had all I needed to begin my reforms.”\n\n-Arosha, Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 3: Letters with Lothane"

 flavor_clouded_eye.4.d:0 "“On one of the tours of the tribe, I came upon the mint I had set up in Gulenhyl. An excited minter motioned me over to show me his impressive collection of coins. I picked one up and saw the face of Grama Clouded Eye on it. On it read ‘Shaman, Prophetess, and Chieftain.’ Though I never personally knew Grama, it touched me to see how she was still respected here.\n\nThe next coin depicted the face of my father, Thrak Oakbreaker. Tears came to my eyes as the memories flowed back of my father refusing to join the Greentide before being brutally struck down. I brought my mind back to the present as I read the text on the coin. ‘Father, Warrior, Martyr.’ He was indeed a martyr. If it wasn’t for his sacrifice, none of this would’ve ever happened.\n\nThe next coin showed my face on it. It read ‘Mother of Clouded Eye, Corin’s Disciple.’ I was hesitant on this one. I didn’t feel like I was that great. Sure, I made several reforms and was chieftain of the clan, but surely if anyone was to be considered the Mother of Clouded Eye, it’d be Grama. I tried to get the minter to change the coin, but he refused, saying that I was the one to establish the currency, so I’m going on it.\n\nLastly, the minter showed me a coin that made my stomach twist. On it was Korgus’s face. I knew the minter meant no harm, but Korgus was a murderer, warmonger, and conman. On the coin read ‘Conqueror of Escann, Son of Dookan.’ I looked at the minter and asked, ‘Why is Korgus on the coin?’\n\n‘Chieftain, you must recognize his military genius and accomplishments,’ the minter hesitantly said.\n\n‘Let me make this clear. Korgus may be a great general, but he is not a figure to look up to. Grama was a cunning leader and general who made Rottenstep a success,’ I retorted. I stood there for a while before a thought came to mind. ‘In fact, destroy all coins of Korgus. In his stead, we shall make coins of Corin, a general just as good as Korgus and a goddess in her own right.’\n\nIn a few months’ time, I was taking a stroll through the streets and saw the new coins in the hands of merchants being used for exchange. The fact that dedicated merchants were now a thing and were wealthy showed me that the currency was a success.”\n\n-Arosha Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 7: The Birth of Trade"

 flavor_clouded_eye.5.t:0 "Pact of Pixiebury"
 flavor_clouded_eye.5.d:0 "“As it turned out, Clouded Eye wasn’t the only clan to denounce Korgus. To the south lied Heartgrinder. Ghurad Heartgrinder, immediately after the Battle of Rottenstep, stood up to Korgus and told him he wasn’t going to slaughter more of his men for Korgus’s bloody conquests. Korgus struck down Ghurad, but didn’t kill him. Since that day, Ghurad repudiated Korgus and has been isolated from other orcs.\n\nWe met in Pixiebury in Ghurad’s private cabin. Ghurad’s niece, Sheru, was there for the meeting, showing herself as a brilliant heir for Heartgrinder. We discussed our renunciations of Korgus, commitments for a new era for the orcs, and our bold visions. Ghurad and Sheru talked about their plans for a peaceful farming country for the orcs and potentially all of Escann. I discussed my plans for a modern yet traditional orcish kingdom protected by the woods where orcs and half-orcs can live in peace.\n\nHalfway through the meeting, we came to discuss a formal alliance. Both of our nations stood at odds with all the other orc clans in Escann and the humans would show us no love. We came up with the Pact of Pixiebury. It was a formal treaty discussing our commitments to each other’s success. Clouded Eye was to focus on conquering Bladebreaker and defending the orcs in the north while Heartgrinder was to protect the orcs in the south. Through this, Eastern Escann could be a safe haven for orcs even as the west was being reclaimed by the marcher lords.\n\nThe preamble was as follows:\n‘We, the chieftains of Clouded Eye and Heartgrinder, in order to preserve orckind in Escann, renounce Korgus as an imposter and liar. Instead of the slaughter and lawlessness preached by him and his successors in Venomtooth and Bloodgorger, we preach acceptance, justice, and civilization. Our duty is to promote the general welfare and defense of the orcs. We do ordain and establish the Pact of Pixiebury so our posterity can enjoy the blessings of independence and prosperity.’\n\n-Arosha Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 4: Pact of Pixiebury"

All I ever heard of Regar was that he was useless, achieved nothing, and was so disappointing that Ghurad would rather have his niece take over rather than his own son.\n\nRegar proved to be something else. He was the scrawny wimp he was made out to be (though he could still knock out a human civilian easily), but he was intelligent. I sent him to go study the old records from Kondunn and Castellyr that were lying around. He surpassed my wildest expectations by memorizing them and taking lessons from them to tell me how to best do some things like lay out building codes or levy troops.\n\nOver time, I started to feel something more than just friendship whenever we met. Regar would often tell me a cheesy joke that he no doubt found in those old records. One evening, he told me a joke about the healer and the centaur child with a sore throat.\n\n‘I know what the problem is,’ Regar joked as he was talking through the healer’s voice, ‘you’re a little horse!’ It was so stupid, yet I couldn’t stop myself from laughing, spurting out the beer I was drinking. Regar gave me that smug look that only a dork like him could pull off. I playfully slapped him on the shoulder and told him to shut up.\n\nBefore I knew it, it was our wedding day. As we were blessed by both the shamans and given vows by a priestess of Corin, I looked into his eyes and smiled. I managed to find love and my line would not end with me.”\n\n-Arosha Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 5: Regar Heartgrinder"

Mothers were talking about jewelry in the village’s general store while fathers were working on fixing a wagon that one of the wargs bit into out of boredom.\n\nA patrol of orc warriors wearing armor of human design but with Clouded Eye insignia entered the village. The warriors observed how no one was too worried about raids from roving bands of rogue orcs or wild animal attacks. In fact, the situation was positively idyllic.\n\nOne warrior was approached by a little orc girl holding a flower. She grinned as she looked up at him, her small tusks jutting out of her lips as she held out her flower for him. “This is for you, warrior, for being a hero and keeping my mommy and daddy safe,” she said. The warrior grabbed the flower and turned it over.\n\nIt was a small gesture from an innocent child, but after a lifetime of war, the warrior cherished it. All his life, he’d been sent on campaigns against the humans at Rottenstep, the raiders at Dogwood, and the rebels in the hills around the capital. This was a sight he could get used to.\n\nAs the sun set on the village, one could only hope that this would last a long time. And indeed, all across Clouded Eye, several villages were just as peaceful. The population would begin to soar as there was more young men and women who didn’t die in war and could now have big families with the food to back it up."

Among them was even Karagh Bloodfist, the monster that abused Lothane, killed his fellow half-orcs, and then attempted to seize control of Bladebreaker. He gave me a death glare, and even vowed that he’d kill me and Lothane if it was the last thing he’d do. Funny that he’d say that since he wouldn’t be alive after this day.\n\nThe procession ended in front of the old chieftain’s tent. The gallows were set up. The names were read out: Amug Skullsmasher, Garl Skinsplitter, Lagba Bonecrusher, and Karagh Bloodfist. Varok Bladebreaker was not among the list as I deemed him not deserving of execution.\n\nThe executioner pulled the lever, leaving four bodies hanging with a gruesome sound. Amug, Garl, and Lagba died instantly, their necks snapped. Karagh, on the other hand, grasped at the noose as he painfully suffocated. He gasped and had one last horrified look before his eyes glazed over and all movement ceased.\n\nAfter a moment to process the grisly scene, I turned to face the orcs in attendance and announced, ‘I am sorry you had to witness that, but they were the worst of the worst. They were murderers, defilers of orcish dignity, torturers, and slavers. There was no place for them in civilized society and they were never going to change. It was better that they’d be executed now than corrupt us further.\n\n‘On to the main topic of this speech, as of today, the Bladebreaker tribe is to now be a part of the greater Clouded Eye realm. We shall work together for the common good of orckind, hand in hand, as we advance towards the future. I envision a future where all orc clans unite under one banner, not to conquer and enslave, but to survive and thrive. And for the first lesser chief of Bladebreaker, I present to you Varok Bladebreaker.’\n\nI looked behind me, only to notice Varok and several other Bladebreaker leaders missing.

The iconic Silver Citadel had been entirely caved in as smoldering ashes could still be found around the remnants of the old castle town. Ardent Keep was never an especially important city. Even before the Greentide, it was decaying, surpassed by Westgate and Southgate. Nevertheless, it stood as a great reminder of how far Escann had fallen.\n\nNow as I entered the streets, it was a prominent sign of the new age. While the Silver Citadel still laid in ruins, the walls have been rebuilt to the level it was before the Greentide. Houses in the town were repaired and the place was liveable. Merchants came into the city from different parts of Clouded Eye to trade for goods while craftsmen set up forges and workshops in the city. A carpenter talked with a mason about the new construction standards while a blacksmith inspected some armor salvaged from Castellyrian ruins.\n\nI walked up to the base of the new manor built in the center of town, after having cleared up the old town hall and slums that were built around it. While it was no palace, it’d make do. Around the manor, there was empty land that was set aside for expansion of the manor.\n\nWalking into the manor, I saw several bureaucrats running around and setting things up. Court officials carried scrolls, old books, and even a new seal with the symbol of the Clouded Eye on it.\n\nI entered my new throne room and saw the light shining in from the windows. Above the throne was a banner displaying our clan symbol, the crest of an axe cutting an oak tree, and embedded in the wall was a brilliant opal gem. Tapestries weaved by our finest weavers displayed events in Clouded Eye’s history. Grama receiving her vision, the Battle of Rottenstep, the ascension of Corin, myself becoming the chieftain of Clouded Eye, and the settling of Ardent Keep.\n\nThere was still a long ways to go, but for now, Ardent Keep was a symbol.

During wrestling matches, he’d always lose. He could not run to save his life nor swim. He was often forced to do menial tasks at camp while his older siblings and the others were sent on hunts and raids. He would even overhear talks about selling him into slavery.\n\nThat all changed when the new chieftain entered the village. Arosha was not a traditional orc chieftain. She often argued that strength meant nothing if not tempered by justice and kindness. When she saw Orthag reading old Escanni records, she knew what she had to do.\n\nOrthag was given a room in the manor (originally a storage closet before the builders realized the room was too big). The task was simple: create a written form of Orcish. Orthag had access to books written in Common and tablets etched in Dwarven runes. He studied day and night, often testing different combinations until he found the ideal letters to put into the alphabet.\n\nAfter five years, Orthag showed Arosha his magnum opus - a translation of the famous Castellyrian play Castan the Great. The new written language was made mandatory education for chiefs, nobles, shamans, and priests. Arosha was so pleased by the progress that she even wrote a letter to Lothane in Orcish (though such letter was sadly unreadable for Lothane so she switched back to Common for their letters).\n\nOne interesting emergence was the fact that since Orthag only really had communication with the northeast of Escann, he codified and standardized the Ungulan language into being the closest modern language to Old Orcish.”\n\n-Muroga Stonecrusher, Professor of Clouded Eye History in the University of Kondunn on Castanmark 14, 1932"

Once, it stretched all the way to Castonath. However, Castan Beastbane burnt it down millennia ago, labeling everything that didn’t look human as a monster. Harpies, gnolls, centaurs, and fey creatures in general were slaughtered, turning Cannor into a land of humans. However, his actions left a mark. By burning down the tree, it led to the old grove to become cursed as crops refused to grow and hags cursed any people that entered.\n\nAs I entered the gates of the protected castle with my army, I had a plan. Our clan needed skilled leaders. While orcs have many great warriors, the art of logistics, military theory, and general administration has eluded us. The plan was simple: if the nobles were to swear loyalty, they’d keep their lands, titles, and wealth, only replacing their old leader with me.\n\nVillagers stood in the streets as they watched us pass. Some had fear in their eyes, others resignation. Stories of massacres committed by the Venomtooth, Bloodgorger, and Deadfang have probably spread here, giving them the image of violent warriors who thirst for human blood. My soldiers were uneasy as well, mostly due to the lack of many men and women in their 20s or 30s.\n\nWhen we reached the central plaza, quite a few nobles bowed their heads. I made them swear oaths of fealty before doing a headcount. As it was, only a third of the nobles actually showed up. As if to dispel any belief that they were merely late, a messenger, a lanky orc, ran in. She was covered in arrows as she panted. Blood pooled beneath her as healers rushed to her side. She pointed towards the gates and said in a weak voice, “They’re here.”\n\n-Arosha Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 15: The Count’s Rebellion"

There are some exceptions. The Sons of Dameria and Order of Corintar seem to be more accepting of orcs, even if the former is more about acceptance of half-humans.\n\nIn [first_half_orc_province.GetName], however, humans and orcs live in peace. Though it started off tense, slowly humans and orcs began to mingle. As the first generation of half-orcs were born, half-orcs across Escann moved in. The result is perhaps the first villages in Escann where half-orcs are the majority.\n\nMuch like Lothane, these half-orcs carry the legacy of two worlds. From the orcs, they got their strength and green skin. From the humans, they got their grace and determination. These half-orcs worship Corin as their goddess, doubtlessly adopted from their human parents and how Corin believed the orcs and half-orcs are as worthy as humans.\n\nAnother curious property of these half-orcs is a surprising aptitude for bureaucracy and commerce. Half-orcs make up a disproportionate percent of the bureaucrat class and merchant class, partly due to orcish culture looking down at those two professions and partly due to humans not currently being trusted with that level of power yet. If we are to become a proper nation, the half-orcs will be the glue that holds us together.\n\nAs I rode home from [first_half_orc_province.GetName], I pondered about the Greentide and its legacy.

All across the Oldhaven area, orcs are settled in newly built houses and new farmlands are tilled. Little by little, the humans got used to the orcs.

The clan of Clouded Eye was to be recognized as not only an orc tribe, but a successor to the Duchy of Kondunn. To bolster those claims, we took a page out of Brasur’s book and married human nobles to orc chiefs. While unpopular among them, these political marriage gave rise to a new half-orc nobility.\n\nAfter several years, the Oldhaven area has become a new center of half-orc culture. While no one bought our claim of heritage from Kondunn, it showed that we were open to accepting some human culture. But it was having an effect. A few humans and orcs started to accept the identity of a Kondunner. The former was the descendants of Kondunners reclaiming their heritage after assimilating into Castellyrian culture while the latter adopted some Kondunner customs. Half-orcs have embraced the Kondunner identity more openly, seeing it as a way to legitimize themselves to humans across Escann.”\n\n-Arosha Oakbreaker, The Life of Corin’s Orc Disciple, Volume 3, Chapter 17: Rise of the Half-Orcs"

Several buildings were painted a verdant green hue. The architect, Alanna of Annisoft, claimed that the green coloration was to blend in with the grass and woods around the city. Ironically, the green didn’t match either, making the buildings stand out rather than blend in.\n\nIn the central plaza of the city, a fountain took up the center. The statue atop the fountain was of Corin with her sword and shield put up as she extended a hand. Lovers kissed by the fountain while children flipped coins into it, wishing for whatever thing captivated their minds. The city guards were busy catching thieves and breaking up fights, a rather depressing inevitability for any city.\n\nArdent Keep was also home of perhaps the largest half-orc community in Escann. All across the city, half-orc businesses offered services as broad as carpentry to an emporium to banking. The smell of freshly-cooked bread filled the air as half-orc children running by. Surrounding the expanded palace were several tax offices and other government buildings. Inside, half-orcs along with orcs and humans did the diligent duty of keeping an evolving civilization afloat. Though the ledgers showed that the number of tables needing to be replaced was high this month, the trendline showed that it was decreasing to less than two tables smashed per day.\n\nBy the fountain, two adventurers stood by and looked around. They had long sheathed their weapons and were astounded. The human asked, “Are you sure this is the place the Orc Queen is hiding?”\n\nThe dwarf shrugged and said, “Eh, who cares?

The seventh shaman entered. He was extremely old, perhaps the same age as Grama when she died. He was blindfolded as he walked to the center of the room, using his staff to keep balance.

She parties there until a noble tosses a rope around her neck and she becomes a pet.\n\n‘The gray wolf takes the center path. He goes through some struggles, but he eventually reaches the university, where he finds a beautiful she-wolf.

I wore a royal gown modified to be more orcish along with a fur-lined cape. Walking forward, I passed by the masses who assembled to witness this moment. Orcs from across Escann have gathered to watch the event along with several emissaries from Corintar.\n\nBy the time I reached the throne, the horns were silenced as I took my seat. Lothane walked forwards and announced, ‘We have gathered here today to witness the coronation of Queen Arosha Oakbreaker, my friend and fellow companion of Corin. I know Arosha like a sister.

I only led a clan to survive.\n\nWhile I have aged gracefully compared to some of my old friends, my age still got to me. I was an old woman. The Greentide has mostly ended by now as adventurers created their own kingdoms and now spend more time fighting each other than my fellow orcs.\n\nAnd then there was my family. My two sons and three daughters all have their places already. Grom, my eldest, was a philanderer, Atu was a priestess of Corin, Uroph was a poet, Zhorg was a scholar, and Sheru was a general. I loved all my children, but it was clear none were fit to inherit. However, Grom’s son, Thrak, was. My eldest grandson was the best potential heir to the throne. He abstained from drinking - which was odd considering how much I drank - and gambling. While his tactical skills were average, he was an excellent administrator and diplomat. He was well-read in history and magic. Though not a skilled mage himself, he understood magical theory and spent late nights at Grama Academy helping the shamans with their divination.\n\nAs I thought about Thrak, I felt inspired by Lothane. Lothane had already retired from leading Corintar. He now lived on a quiet farm. Unlike other rulers, he retired to focus on his family and live in peace, not dying in office. The more I thought about it, the more it appealed to me. Perhaps it was time for me to step down and retire to my private estate in Cadell’s Rest. There, perhaps, I could live out my last few years in peace with my husband Regar.\n\nAnd so it was. Thrak was given the throne as I rested on my estate in Cadell’s Rest with Regar. Visitors from all over Escann and beyond would often show up to interview one of the surviving companions of Corin.

A few years ago, Regar died of a heart attack, which left her depressed and feeling empty. Around the same time, the local healer diagnosed her with an incurable disease that kills slowly. Arosha faced the disease with bravery, but there’s only so much an orc in her 90s could do.\n\nA priest stood by Arosha as she took the vows to convert to Corinism. As Arosha swore in a hoarse voice to uphold the sword and shield to fight evil wherever it lies and protect righteousness, the attendants shed tears. Once a mighty chieftain and queen with a bellowing voice and vigor was now a frail old woman. The orc who slew countless foes was now bedridden.\n\nAfter the conversion ended, Arosha looked at Lothane and joked, “You know how we had bets on who’d live the longest? I think you won.” Arosha weakly laughed before coughing up blood. “By Corin, when is this pain going to end? How long do I have to suffer until I can join my older brother and parents?” She grabbed a bottle of liquor from the end table and drank it dry. She wiped her mouth as she placed the bottle back down. “That reminded me of the good old days, of the old drinking contests between me and Rethag.” She looked at Rethag in the group and asked, “You loved those, didn’t you?”\n\nOne of the great-grandchildren, a little orc boy, ran up to Arosha and grabbed her hand. He started crying. “Mama Arosha, please don’t leave me! You’re my best friend!”\n\nArosha chuckled as she messed with his hair. “This happens to all orcs eventually. The most we can do is make sure we leave a legacy worth remembering.

Our head shamans use it to see visions of the future that may come to pass and give direction to the state.\n\nToday, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approached the head shaman and requested a vision. The head shaman faces [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and pulls a lever, raising the Clouded Eye out of the ground to catch the light of the full moon.\n\nAs the moonlight hits the Clouded Eye, symbolism bombards [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Images of wolves fighting over a rabbit, seeds sown and blooming into flowers, and a scrawny half-orc carrying a scroll and shouting into an angry crowd come to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nAs the visions fade away, the head shaman looks at [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and asks, “Which vision struck out to you the most?”"

 flavor_clouded_eye.23.d:0 "Grama is old. Unlike the other clans, Clouded Eye valued wisdom over might. She was chieftain of the Clouded Eye clan when a young Korgus marched in with his first followers and announced that he was the Dookanson. Grama was among the first to believe, having seen a vision of orcs living in green fields. She took it as a sign that Korgus really was the Dookanson.\n\nFor decades, Grama was one of Korgus’s main advisors, using her shamanic divination and wit to give him battleplans and work out some rudimentary new forms of worship and theology. It was Grama who devised the Battle of Rottenstep, using the marshes to the orc advantage, she feigned retreat, getting humans bogged down and lost as the warriors of Clouded Eye picked them off with arrows along with hit and run tactics. The ambush was a critical factor in turning Rottenstep into a resounding success, though this claim is disputed by the clan of Bladebreaker, which claims it was their weapons that won the battle.\n\nDuring the Battle of Castonath, Grama was informed of the losing situation and quickly decided to guide her tribe to prosperous lands. The Clouded Eye clan settled in the foothills of the Serpentspine, in the old gold mines of Gulenhyl, which once supplied Castellyr with the wealth to put up a good enough fight to hold back the Greentide a decade.\n\nAs Grama approaches her reincarnation, she steps forward, leaning on her staff as she faces the crowd. The wisest path may not be easy, but she’s determined to use her last few years wisely."

She guided us away from Korgus and instead guided us to a new future. As chieftain of the Clouded Eye clan, she took lessons from the humans and combined it with orcish traditions. We've built a mint, built a bureaucracy, defeated our rivals, harnessed the power of the Clouded Eye, and began the long process to start being seen as equals to humans. As the queen of our new kingdom, she ensured that the Ozarm'chadash was reformed from a battle to the death to instead being a nonlethal contest of merit.\n\nMany rulers may come and go, but Arosha Oakbreaker will remain in our cultural memory forever."
