### EVENTS ###

 flavour_xanzerbexis.1.t:0 "Depletion of the Khenak Wyvern"
 flavour_xanzerbexis.1.d:0 "The Wyvern is the symbol of the Khenak, and anyone dwelling near the peaks have had to contend with the wingwyrms. Wyverns are quite dangerous, and even for a rugged people such as ourselves, there is no pack that has not lost members to wyvern predation. This has come to shape our culture, and it is common knowledge that the wyvern weeds out the weak, to the benefit of those more fit to live.\n\nBesides, what the wyvern takes, she gives back manyfold. Every pack in the Khenak Range hunts wyverns, and every kill is used to the fullest: Scales for armour, wing-webbing for waterproof storage, bones for weapons and tools, some so sturdy they have been passed down for generations, and flesh to feed a pack for weeks. Even the blood and bile of the wyvern is of value, and while neither can be safely consumed, both are vital in alchemy. Wyvern venom is one of the most lethal toxins in the world, and sees common use in our skirmishes with our human neighbours.\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that as our people grew, the wyvern diminished. Every pack in the Khenak hunted wyverns, and now, with more gnolls in the mountains than ever, they have grown scarce. While it is the way of things for the weak to die so the strong may thrive, some older gnolls look upon the peaks of the Khenak, their brows heavy and mournful. They say that the Khenak Range, which once rang with the roars of the wingwyrms, has gone silent."
 flavour_xanzerbexis.1.a:0 "Perhaps their silence will become ours as well."

 flavour_xanzerbexis.2.t:0 "The Eighty-Six Packs"
 flavour_xanzerbexis.2.d:0 "The hut was small, too small for the pack of gnolls who had all squeezed in to huddle around the fireplace. The flames were the only light, reflecting the two dozen pairs of hungry gnollish eyes. Uren, one of the pairs, was hungry as well.\n\nThis by itself was not unusual. He had been hungry since he had been captured. Or rather, given as tribute to the Hillthrone. The pack elders had snarled, growled, spat and cursed, but they had relented. He had been chosen, then shipped off to Akaz Lokkex like so many more. He still remembered the cart. Some rolling Busilari chicken-coop, remade into a prison on wheels. By all the powers below, he'd kill for a chicken.\n\nAnd now, he was here. A storm of violence later. Training, they had called it. Testing. They had starved him, beaten him, day after day after day. How long? He didn’t know. None of them did. But today was different. He could smell it.\n\nWhen the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entered the hut, Uren and everyone else knew who she was. She was bigger than any other gnoll here. Her scent was regal, and her bearing spoke of might. A simple iron band rested upon her brow, eighty-six gnoll fangs attached to the ring with wyvernbone nails. She sat down by the fireplace, and began to speak, her voice ringing out against the gloom and the firelight burning in hungry eyes."
 flavour_xanzerbexis.2.a:0 ""My Vrestukex" she began..."
 
 flavour_xanzerbexis.31.t:0 "The Vrestukex"
 flavour_xanzerbexis.31.d:0 "Uren shifted. Vrestukex. Hill's Eyes. It had been their name ever since they were taken. A hostage, and yet... something else. Something more. A hostage didn't need training. Didn't need punishment. And a hostage wasn't killed for failure.\n\n"When you came here, you each carried your tribe with you. Eighty-six packs, at war with one another. But if we are to live, and if we are to conquer, there can be only one pack. Your elders did not understand this." The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stared out across the fireplace. The dozen pinpricks of light faded, the gaze of the pack downcast to avoid her gaze.\n\n"But I think you do. Today your training ends. War comes to the Khenak, and it is a war we will win." She spoke evenly, as if stating a fact. "You will return to your tribes, and you will tell them that the Hillthrone goes to war. You will tell them that loyal service will be rewarded with lands, spoils, and slaves aplenty. Any pack waging war in my name will have a seat at my fire." A pause, then a snort. "And any pack who refuses will have a place on my pyre."\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stood to her full height, looming over her pack. Uren bowed his head, as did his peers. He already knew that there would be no refusal. His pack had given him over to this. They were weak. But he would show them strength. His stomach growled. Anyone raising any objection would die. He would not fail the Hillthrone.\n\n"Your loyal service will be rewarded. Now go." The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] remained still, while the pack exploded into motion around her, the Vrestukex stepping over each other to be the first into the breach. They knew that the Hillthrone did not suffer indolence."
 flavour_xanzerbexis.31.a:0 "They run as if the whips of their masters are behind them!"

 
 flavour_xanzerbexis.3.t:0 "The Last Clutch"
 flavour_xanzerbexis.3.d:0 "The throw had been true.\n\nFrom above, there was a screech of pain that rattled the stones of the high Khenak peaks, echoing off bare cliff faces and carried by whipping blizzard winds. A large shadow flitted back and forth behind the curtain of snow, and splashes of hot blood landed around the hunters from their wounded quarry as it fled ever higher. The gnolls barked and yipped, following their pack leaders up the mountain paths to follow the crimson trail. But when they finally crested the final cliff's edge, even the veteran hunter was surprised.\n\nThe wyvern-mother had not flown off alone, but had retreated to its nest, an unusual move for the secretive creatures. Wordlessly, the hunting pack leader stepped forward, intending to face the unusual situation herself. The wyvern drew itself up to its full height and snarled at the gnoll with the imperious pride of its dragonkin. Then it leaned its head down to sniff and lick at the spear embedded in its chest, fashioned from the barbed tail of a wyvern.\n\nWith one final look at its clutch, and a final choked whine, the wyvern supplicated itself before the pack hunter. After a moment, the master understood. Covered in the spoils of past wyvern hunts, wielding the barbed wyvernspear, this creature mistook the gnoll as another of its kind. A superior hunter, and now it submitted, hoping that its eggs would be spared."
 flavour_xanzerbexis.3.a:0 "Life they would have, but what kind?"
 
 flavour_xanzerbexis.4.t:0 "The Troll Toll"
 flavour_xanzerbexis.4.d:0 "Captain Tomas smirked from the helm of his ship, which with its lanterns extinguished was barely visible in the bare moonlight. Off to the south, Businor was a dim shadow on the horizon, speckles of firelight dotting the coast the only evidence of life. The wind was favorable, and their passage was quiet. He had heard that the gnolls had instituted some absurd toll to use the Lion's Pass. Trying to pretty up their piracy under another name, simultaneously shameless and pretentious. He had boasted back in Crathanor that he had been plying the waters around Tef for decades and had never paid a copper to any reaver, and he had no intention to start now. For some reason, not all of his fellow captains had cheered his bravado.\n\nThe blaring of horns from the south, echoed by similar horns from the north after a moment, made the rest of the crew tense in worry, but Tomas was unconcerned. He smirked and made a dismissive wave.\n\n"Cowards. Why are you worried? There are no ships ahead and we have the wind at our backs. First mate, get the rowers moving, full sprint. They will never catch us now."\n\nHis confidence was shaken when he saw bright columns of magical light spearing through the darkness on the northern and southern coasts, which rapidly swept the pass before locking onto his ship. Revealed as surely as if it had been noon on a summer's day, he whirled and began to shout before being silenced by a bright pink stone striking square in his chest, knocking him to the deck. Soon there was a rain of stones and weights in a dizzying array of colors, shredding the sails and sending the crew scurrying for cover in a loud panic.\n\nFrom the shore, two trolls squinted into the distance. One was significantly happier than the other, excitedly marking a prominent line on its tally stone.\n\n"I got the shouty one!"\n\n"...lucky throw. You'll never do it again. Double or nothing.""

 flavour_xanzerbexis.5.d:0 "Coria Pearler squinted into the midnight gloom, as the horse pulling her family's wagon stopped abruptly. Behind her, her husband and children were sleeping, and ahead, the road fell into darkness. And yet, a sound. Paws on gravel. Coria cocked her crossbow. Her horse whickered nervously. Something grunted in the darkness. Something big.\n\n"Peace" a voice rang out from the murk, heavy and accented. "Your tongue, foreign to me. You Ko-ria Pearler, yes?"\n\n"Who asks, lurking in darkness?" Coria's voice was even, braced by a courage she did not feel.\n\n"I Uren Vrestukex. No wish to scare your horse." The voice was circling, now off to the left. "You go north, many gnolls there. They kill any man they find. You want to flee Businor, but I tell you, stay. You belong to Hillthrone. You our pack now. One of your cubs become Vrestukex. It will be a good life."\n\n"But not a free life. We will be slaves."\n\n"Not kerho. Vraka." A pause. "Farmer, in your tongue."\n\n"And you will just let us go home? Why should we trust you?"\n\n"No trust. Your cubs become Vrestukex. Our cubs become Vrestukex. Then maybe, trust. Think, before you go north to die."\n\n"What is this "Vrestukex?" Coria's voice rang out in the night, but the darkness offered no reply. It was only when Coria pulled the cart off the road, to wake her family and debate this ominous visit, that she realized one of her sons was missing."
 flavour_xanzerbexis.5.a:0 "That's it! I am turning this cart around!"
 
 flavour_xanzerbexis.6.t:0 "They threatened to do what?"
 flavour_xanzerbexis.6.d:0 ""You can give, in peace, or we bury all under the high stones. Choice yours, matters not to us."\n\nThe magistrate visibly recoiled in shock, eyes bulging as his mind tried to understand the dire implications of the envoy before him. He had been sent to survey the damage of a small avalanche, reporting any materials needed for repairs of the Gnollsgate and its surrounding villages. He could never have expected to be met by a gnollish envoy, its fur dyed a dizzying array of bright colors and its mane spiked outward in an outrageous, ostentatious display. After its speech, the gnoll had gone back to gnawing on a roasted chicken.\n\nFinally, the magistrate's shock turned to anger. He tried to pull himself up and put fury in his eyes as he shouted, "You dare threaten-"\n\nHe was interrupted by a sickening crack as the gnoll bit the chicken carcass in half, chewing the meat, bones and gristle with obvious relish. It tossed the remainder of the chicken aside and hoisted itself up, resting a greatsword on its shoulder as it stalked forward. Even with its hunched frame, it seemed to loom over the magistrate with murderous intent. Its high pitched, yipping laugh was only interrupted when it swallowed the carcass, before it repeated.\n\n"Give, or we bury. Choice yours. Matters not to us.""

 flavour_xanzerbexis.7.d:0 "The gunshot rang out across the firing range with a sharp crack, and a hundred meters downrange a bullet pierced the front of an oxen carcass with a dull thud. The gnoll arquebusier lowered her weapon, and began cleaning the bore with practiced ease.\n\n"As you can see, the initial effect is mundane!" a grizzled Xalgazelag explained to the delegation observing the firing exercise. "But come!" He gestured eagerly, shuffling towards the carcass.\n\n"You see, the problem was always to forge a projectile that could reliably carry and deliver the substance. Being fired from a gun is quite traumatic to the bullet." A gnollish chuckle followed, and the delegation exchanged nervous glances.\n\n"But there. See?" The Xalgazelag gestured to the carcass, or specifically, to the entry wound.

The weather was perfect, the light was absent, and the only way anyone would notice them was if someone on the shoreline could see in pitch-black darkness. Even then, it would take them too long to raise an alarm, and his ship would handily outrun any pursuit in the long run, even with the hold full of wyvernbone for Nathalaire.\n\nAnd yet, the fur on his neck was standing up. He had half a mind to turn the ship around and make for the Tefkora Pass, when he heard it.\n\n"BwooooooooouuuUUUUU!"\n\nIt was a horn, in the same way that a dragon was a lizard. The noise was heard as much as felt, ringing in Farruc's ears and tingling in his bones. The entire crew looked up towards the source of the cacophony. One of the stone lions! The horn rang out again longer this time, before another of the stone lions joined the chorus from the other side of the strait.

A new faith for a new age, there is broad agreement on this.

This faith has a long history in Cannor and would truly signal a shift to a more peaceful, civilized society. It would also calm the fears of those same human packmates, who have viewed our demon worship with suspicion.\n\nWe could also follow the great War Goddess Corin and support her claim to dominion over the court. Many gnolls favor following this avatar of battle, for her martial feats and the act of ascension are somewhat similar to the Xhaz of old, while leaving behind the legacy of brutality that marks us as barbarians.[Root.XanzerbexisIsRavelianEnabled]\n\nWe have also been approached by powerful and influential members of a secret sect that the humans call the Infernal Court.

The settlers, loyal guards and everyone captured by these packs are already either enslaved to the war effort, or being sacrificed to the Xhaz. Even here in the Borders, firelight would flicker and sputter a sickly green, blown by an unseen ill wind.\n\nThey had created this threat themselves, Rakzak thought bitterly. The rebellion had struck fast, and with every village and fortification became better equipped and more convinced of victory. She had the royal guard of Igraxraak, but their numbers were few by comparison. They had sent missives to the human packs, requesting aid in stopping this threat, but so far nothing. Rakzak couldn't blame them though. In a dark part of her mind she began to think, she understood why her ancestors had been hunted into the hills.\n\n "Commander!"\n\nThe shout brought her out of her thoughts and she grabbed her sword and bounded outside ready for a fight.

It seemed chaotic, but from among the chaos emerged melodies and rhythms of incredible complexity, the rival of any musical art among the civilized realms. The gnolls were barbarians no longer.\n\nHowever, as the band finished its performance and moved to leave the arena field, the crowd was shocked to see a mighty Wyvern emerge from an underground holding pen. Although its wings had been slashed to prevent flight, the creature was strong and enraged, lashing with its tail in every direction. To face this creature, a band of elite gnoll warriors stepped into the arena wearing ceremonial hunting attire, armored in wyvern scales and wielding spears fashioned of harvested wyvern tails.\n\nBarbarians, perhaps not, but the visitors could not help but shiver when the gnolls pounced on the wyvern, stabbing and jabbing from every direction until finally the packleader tore out the wyvern’s throat with their own fangs.

Moreover, the savagery, hunting instinct and brute strength of the wyvern are all traits that we readily appreciate.\n\nUnfortunately, wyverns have become rare. Overhunting by ourselves and the humans has forced the wingwyrms into decline, and it follows that only the strongest wyverns remain, far up in the Khenak Range. Yet as our realm expands, the demand for wyverns and their products have expanded with it. Wyvern venom especially, has seen a meteoric rise in use by our armies, and only a fool neglects their army when war is on the horizon. Let us gather an expedition of our most grizzled hunters and mountaineers. We will scour the peaks of the Khenak Range for the greatest of the wingwyrms.

We have scoured the libraries of Port Xanzerbexis, sent spies to neighbouring Verne, even reached out clandestinely to the Order of Chroniclers. All that we can learn of the wingwyrms, we will. But in a more direct sense, Hogzhaad will also need more gnollpower to succeed.

Husbandry for wyvernfeed, metalwork for chains, cages and even armour, and of course, breeding and butchering the beasts themselves. While this group has little influence outside the Khenak Range, they are already petitioning the Hillthrone for a charter to expand their operations, with their envoy offering to stay at court and offer (admittedly very specific) counsel on all things wyvern-related."

Every day, new ships land in Port Xanzerbexis, bearing Khetaratan grain, Bahari glass, Bulwari silk, and Escanni iron. Every day, merchant ships pay the Igraxraak toll to sail through the Busilari straits to the Dameshead and beyond. While it is tempting to say that they choose this because there is no alternative, the truth is that since we established hegemony over Businor, the new Wyvern Trade Route is faster, safer and cheaper than it ever was under the squabbling humans of Busilar, Eborthil and Verne. Igraxraak has brought peace, and peace has brought us wealth.\n\nSo let us reflect on this for a moment, and once we are done, let us draw up plans to expand our trade across the borders, towards the Dameshead itself.

Every year, the need for steel increases, for cages, chains, weapons… The list goes on.\n\nFor many years, the idea of a metal shortage has been foreign to Igraxraak, with the Khenak Range's seemingly everlasting copper. But where the Khenak Range is rich in copper, it is poor in iron. By contrast, the Wexhills to the north are rich beyond measure, with the ancient castle of Bal Hyl squatting on a veritable mountain of iron.

 A49_our_way_forward_desc:0 "The war is over.\n\nThe kingdom of Busilar has been cast down. Its cities have been razed, its armies routed, and its people now forced to kneel to a new throne - The Hillthrone.\n\nYet now its people give us pause. In spite of the war, many human survivors linger in the ruins of their broken nation, and in most new territories, they outnumber us significantly.\n\nThe Xhazobkult offers a simple answer. Enslave the humans and offer their flesh to the Xhazob. It is our way, the way of our ancestors, and the fate of the weak is to serve as a bloody feast for the strong.\n\nAnd yet, some in our court speak of another path. We always assumed that our rule of Businor would be to the detriment of its human population, but the Busilari peasantry have been unusually cooperative, especially in the lands of the Ivemkverag. Their attitude of "live and let live, so long as the taxes are paid" seems popular with the humans, and there is in theory no reason that we cannot do the same. Govern well, win over the populace, and make this young nation a place where people, human or gnoll, can live... If not in harmony, at least in détente. The Xhazobkult calls this heresy, but the Kult does not rule Businor, and nor do they pay taxes, for that matter. Perhaps this is worth a try..."

 A49_invite_our_cousins_desc:0 "While our cooperation with Busilari has bore fruit, it has put our administration in an awkward position. On one side, The Ivemkverag howl for greater integration, and our Busilari subjects naturally favour this. On the other hand, the Xhazobkult grumble that we have lost our way, and many among our gnollish subjects agree. Plainly speaking, this state of affairs can only harm Igraxraak if it is allowed to continue.\n\nSo, we will need backers of our own, people loyal only to our new nation. And it just so happens that there is no shortage of gnolls across the Divenhal, seeking a better life. Let us extend a paw of friendship to them, bring them to Igraxraak, and settle them in the Businori countryside, still devastated by the conquest. With the influx of subjects loyal to the Hillthrone, we will nip this factional strife in the bud."

 A49_entice_human_migrants_title:0 "Entice Human Migrants"
 A49_entice_human_migrants_desc:0 "As our mercenaries march north to win glory and wealth on the fields of Cannor, they are met with a peculiar sight marching south. Humans. Heaps and heaps of harried, hollow-eyed humans, fleeing the battlefields of the north in search for a better life. It appears that word has spread of the safety and prosperity enjoyed by the human subjects of Igraxraak, and as such, thousands of displaced Cannorians are now crossing the border, seeking sanctuary behind the relative safety of the Khenak Range.\n\nThis is surprising, considering that not so long ago, only a madman would seek a refuge among gnolls. But even so, it is not unwelcome. The influx of skilled labour can only benefit the state, and relations between our human subjects and the Hillthrone have reached a point where we need not fear an insurgency. Let it be known far and wide that Igraxraak will be a home to any human willing to work for her prosperity!"

 A49_home_with_no_borders_desc:0 "While the economic upswing in Businor has brought our realm both wealth and prestige, it has introduced a problem to our society which, while familiar to humans, is almost unheard of for Gnolls. Overpopulation. It appears that in the absence of war, poverty and famine, our people are living longer, healthier lives. This in turn means pups! Many more pups. More pups, larger families, and less room for everyone.\n\nBut, where our heartland is crowded, our newer territories are relatively untamed. The Borders to our north, the Vernman side of the Khenak Range, and especially the demon-infested swamps of Daravan's Folly are all relatively depopulated. Let us therefore draft a new law - the Axatala Act. Axatala is a gnollish phrase, roughly translated to "home with no borders". We will offer our subjects free land in our territorial holdings, as well as solid credit rates for loans issued by the Hillthrone. Our settlers will spread the wealth from our core to our periphery, and all of Igraxraak shall be the stronger for it."

They say that a new Xhazobain will come, and with their strength they will wipe out the humans and all the other weak prey that would stand in their way. Xhazobkultists who rejected our new faith flock to join the Flamemarked and so far our governors seem unable - or unwilling - to stop the spread of this fanaticism."

Most of the human inhabitants of Daravans Folly have fled or been thrown to the pyres, along with our loyal soldiers. There is no forgiving this betrayal. We will march side by side with our human pack members and match our cannons against their demonic fire and see who is truly strong.\n\nFine Lorentish wine is just as red as fresh, living blood. And it has left our fangs just as sharp."

To achieve it we buried the Ivemkverag with their banners, threw the Xhazobkultists upon their own pyres and reached new heights of knowledge, both scientific and arcane. We have already killed hundreds of thousands of fools and zealots to build our better world. If the archaic empires of old wish to join the pile, who are we to deny them?"

Trade flows undisturbed across Cannor and beyond, moving enough goods to support the creation of wyvern farms and processing centers almost anywhere the wyverns themselves would thrive. The presence of a wyvern farm is an economic boon for nearby residents, bringing industry and investment that transforms subsistence farmlands into modern communities overnight. This demonstrates the truth and morality of our ideals. Where we march, we cast down the oppressors and bring wealth and freedom to the oppressed. Who could argue that spreading this dream to the world is not righteous?"

Now, it is merely another wall of our prison, still standing even after the fall of Busilar. An even greater affront is that the area is still inhabited by gnolls, even though it is ruled by humans. What a travesty!\n\nThe commanders of our border guards have proposed an unusual solution to this problem: Extortion with boulders. We control the heights overlooking the human lands, and we could do significant damage to local infrastructure if we pushed a few rocks around. A suggestion could be made to the human lords, saying that this horrible risk could be avoided if only Gnollsgate was given back to its rightful masters. If they accept, everyone wins, if they defy us, they will be unable to resist. To them, this type of warfare is a complete unknown – they are completely unprepared to deal with a rolling stone!"

The shadow port of Nathalaire is inundated with a certain type of human that, for all their trappings of civilization, remind us rather of ourselves. Nathalaire also sits on one of the few habitable islands in Daravan’s Folly, thus giving the port almost complete control of trade flowing from Escann into the Divenhal on the Nath.\n\nFor this reason alone, Nathalaire must be put under Gnollish management. Moreover, the port will serve as a perfect perch from which to keep an eye on Daravan’s Folly, something the Xhazobkult insists is a matter of national security."

But recently the gnoll packs have been harried by human settlers and adventurers, chasing the remaining packs into ever more remote havens in the mire. Representatives of these Flamemarked Gnolls have sent requests for our help against these invaders. Just as we reclaimed the homeland of the Hill Gnolls, we will reclaim the homeland of the Flamemarked!"
