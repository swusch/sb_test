 iochand.1.t:0 "The House of Iochand"
 iochand.1.d:0 "The terror of the Dragonwake brought chaos and disorder to the former lands of the Gnomish Hierarchy. As endless hordes of Kobolds flooded the Dragondowns, gripping the Hierarchy in total war, the governors of farther-flung territories were suddenly thrust into the spotlight of history, newly exposed to the foreign politics, and yet poised to benefit all the same. One such gnome, Fizwick Allspark, authored a new chapter in the history of folk both small and tall, seizing the opportunity by converting to the worship of the Cannorian gods. A royal coronation swiftly unfolded in Portnamm Theatre, with a priest of Castellos placing with utmost solemnity a prop crown on the newly minted King Fizwick I Allspark, thereby creating the great Kingdom of Iochand in 471.\n\nIochand fought many wars in the coming decades, but the kingdom would meet its ultimate foe over two hundred years after its founding. The dreaded Reavers appeared from the north for the first time along the Dragon Coast in the 8th century, in search of fortune and conquest, and in what is now Reaver's Landing, a great host arrived and conquered the lands to the north, establishing both the Kingdom of Reveria and a rivalry that would destroy Iochand. Centuries later, in 1264, Reverian armies overran the capital of Iochand itself, laying waste to town and country. Fizwick III, the final king of the realm, was burned alive, along with nearly the entirety of the House of Iochand when the Reverian soldiers lit the royal palace ablaze.\n\nAllspark's fire lives still in precious few souls, and none but two are suitable candidates to rule our kingdom into the future."
