 monstrous.101.t:0 "Of Monsters and War"
 monstrous.101.d:0 "Our monstrous nature has allowed our people to be ferocious and savage in combat. For aeons our dominions have been a monstrous frontier, unwelcome to most and dangerous to all. We do not subscribe to the civilities of warfare. Our people have fought for their land. Our people have fought to win. Our people have fought to survive.\n\nBut the reformists in our ranks say that we must hold ourselves to a standard greater than our own, that we must fight on the same playing field as our more civilized neighbours.

 monstrous.117.d:0 "As we continue our progress in Demonsterization we have built a more bureaucratic and clerical caste that will help govern and reform our country.

 monstrous.121.db:0 "Our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has returned to our realm a new person.\n\nThey had a great time learning and living out there, and have taken back a great many things to teach us on how to be accepted in the greater world."
 monstrous.121.dc:0 "Our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has returned to our realm a new person.\n\nThey return almost foreign to our lands, speaking fluently in their tongue, and dressing in their clothes.

 monstrous.122.t:0 "Heroes Attack Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 monstrous.122.d:0 "Adventurers. Long have they been the bane of many a 'monstrous' nation, slipping behind our borders to strike at whatever target they deem prestigious enough. Now, they've committed an even more heinous offense against our people - attacking the very heart of our country; our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!\n\nWhilst we rested, a group of those fortune-seeking vagrants launched an assault against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], catching us unaware. Though we quickly rose at the sound of the alarm, they had already engaged [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in battle! Even now, as we hasten to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, we can hear the raging sounds of combat in the distance!"

 #Lizardfolk Events
 monstrous.201.t:0 "The Light of Taneyas"
 monstrous.201.d:0 "In our efforts to spread the truth and beauty of lizardfolk history to foreigners, we face a significant problem in the form of Zytazashtu, ‘nine-colour’, our traditional writing system. Zytazashtu utilises multicoloured inks as a means of expression, but most other species are mildly to severely colour blind, with only a crude ability to recognise yellow and a complete inability to see nitukh, arut or even dark red.\n\nThe use of ink colour to inflect meaning is a vital aspect of classical lizardfolk poetry and political treatise, and traditionalists at court argue that using a narrower range of dyes for foreign editions of these works would be tantamount to watering them down. On the other hand, we could hardly expect perfect comprehension from foreigners, even if they could see properly. If we truly wish to be treated with the requisite respect, outsiders must actually be able to read our defining texts."

 monstrous_vibrant_inks:0 "Vibrant Inks"
 
 monstrous.202.t:0 "Comparative Politics"
 monstrous.202.d:0 "The almost incomprehensible span of lizardfolk history has given rise to an equally ancient tradition of political thought and disputation, such that almost no thought has been produced by outsiders which has not at some time also been pondered by the ancient lizardfolk sages. New editions of these political classics would serve to impress upon outsiders the sheer breadth of history we steward.\n\nPublishing comparative works which map foreign political thought onto our own would serve two purposes: better intelligence on our potential adversaries, and a point thoroughly made to any who would dismiss our intellectual heritage."
 monstrous.202.a:0 "Publish and distribute the comparisons."
 monstrous.202.b:0 "Sponsor a new generation of scholars."
 monstrous.202.c:0 "Do we really have to spell it out for them?"

 monstrous.203.t:0 "Recognise Outsider Envoys"
 monstrous.203.d:0 "Foreigners, particularly among the Horasheshi, often claim that we lizardfolk have no understanding of the principle of diplomatic immunity or guest right. This is of course nonsense: such concepts had gained wide currency as early as the Eleventh Empire, long before these outsiders’ ancestors had so much as stopped voiding their bowels on the ground. Envoys from jumped up tribes, however, who falsely represented themselves as sovereign envoys - these were dismissed posthaste as the charlatans they were, and punished thoroughly for their deceit.\n\nOur more liberal-minded courtiers are suggesting that, were we to accept such claims at face value - at least upon initial contact - this might do much to soften our image in the eyes of foreigners. The question is whether we can accept such an affront to the proper concept of sovereignty."

 monstrous_outsider_envoys:0 "Outsider Envoys"
 
 monstrous.204.t:0 "Mutual Deference Amnesty"
 monstrous.204.d:0 "Part of respect for oneself is an insistence on being greeted and received properly by others. This is a principle of lizardfolk political life which we have never compromised for the cheap approval of outsiders, and yet few of them can ever really master the complex systems of bowing, speech modulation, conversational order and meal choice which constitute the etiquette of the high Naga, for example. This is true even if they have strong command of our language, which few outsiders do.\n\nIn addition, foreign visitors often view this enforced deference as implicitly insulting or demeaning. Lessening the rigidity of such demands on foreign diplomats is a high priority among the outward-looking set at court, as repulsive as it might sound."
 monstrous.204.a:0 "They need not bang their heads on the ground."
 monstrous.204.b:0 "We will preserve our self-respect."
 monstrous.204.c:0 "A new inter-species handshake, maybe?"
 
 monstrous.205.t:0 "Reexamine the Histories"
 monstrous.205.d:0 "It is true that there are some historical Empires whose dealings with foreigners were not quite as frosty as ours tend to be now. Yatkara’s Third Emperor List is replete with fascinating details of the 116th Empire’s dealings with a human entity known as the ‘White Soil People’, though beyond the name, records of this no doubt transient polity are somewhat wanting.\n\nIf we truly seek to interact with foreigners more readily, a thorough reorganisation and consultation of our archival materials could offer a wealth of precedent, informing us of the basis on which such dealings were conducted by our ancestors."
 monstrous.205.a:0 "Commission the study."
 monstrous.205.b:0 "What is right requires not the approval of the dead."
 monstrous.205.c:0 "A waste of time."
 
 monstrous.206.t:0 "Rule One"
 monstrous.206.d:0 "It has come to our attention that some of the terms used among the lizardfolk for halflings and humans are a source of great offence for their envoys. One does not repeat these particular terms in polite company, referring as they do to the odd scent of animal milk hanging about the torso or the disgusting bloodshot lividity of wobbling flesh, but of course when lizardfolk envoys on the job mutter amongst themselves, they use such language.\n\nTruth be told, the whole affair is somewhat embarrassing; we are used to our tongue being poorly understood by outsiders. Will we really change the very language we speak for these upjumped foreigners? Few of our diplomats will relish being scolded like a child by our monitors, after all."
 monstrous.206.a:0 "We can still say the words at home, at least."

 monstrous.207.t:0 "Linguistic Mutation"
 monstrous.207.d:0 "Lizardfolk diversity and variability is unparalleled in the known world. Specific lizardfolk communities, especially if isolated, can show profound adaptive biological changes within the span of only a few generations, or even as a result of deliberately directed breeding efforts. A few lizardfolk clans have developed membranes and nodules in their throats, allowing them to produce the strange lipped sounds used by other sentients which have always been a source of great difficulty for us. The profound biological obstacle we face in acquiring these alien languages has played an undeniable role in our historical isolation, and so these lizards present a great opportunity.\n\nOur diplomatic corps has requested funding for the identification of such clans, and wishes to devote resources to teaching throat-lipped lizards to speak foreign languages in a formal setting. On the basic principle that we should be more knowledgeable of the outsiders than they are of us, the proposal has growing support."
 monstrous.207.a:0 "These throat-lipped lizards are useful, if a little repulsive."

 monstrous.208.t:0 "Equivalent Majesty"
 monstrous.208.d:0 "A radical idea circulating within the diplomatic corps has in recent days erupted into open conflict at court. Our most reformist diplomats argue that the only means by which we will truly build meaningful relationships with foreign courts is if we recognise their governments as at least conditionally sovereign, their rulers implicitly on a par with lizardfolk monarchs.\n\nThis is a profound shift in diplomatic protocol, though it need not have an enormous impact on the functioning of the court. By no means do we intend to invite foreign sovereigns onto our soil, after all. The question is primarily one of principle, but this does not make it easy to resolve; millennia have been lived under such principles."
 monstrous.208.a:0 "Each can be said to rule their own sphere."
 monstrous.208.b:0 "Lizardfolk rule is world-historically exceptional."
 
 monstrous.209.t:0 "The Halfling Exception"
 monstrous.209.d:0 "Perhaps the only foreigners who make regular forays into lizardfolk territory are the Vyzemby, the halflings who frequent our ports and with whom we have long traded and corresponded. As explorers and traders from ever further afield ply the coast, we increasingly rely on our Vyzemby contacts for knowledge. They are our window to the world, and they alone among foreigners have an appreciation for the depth of our history and culture.\n\nIt would be absurd for newly-arrived foreigners to suddenly enjoy privileges akin to those the Vyzemby have earned through our long friendship. We would never insult their dignity this way. As a result, a faction at court wishes to see our bond with the Vyzemby formally recognised, granting them precedence for audiences, the right to select the location of their embassy, and free movement."

 monstrous.210.d:0 "We have never recognised the capacity of other species to produce high civilisation. They may serve as vassals or even make firm allies, but countless millennia of statecraft and ambition cannot be matched by upstart tribesmen or primitive nepotistic clan structures, no matter how great their skill or how wise their counsel. As we have begun to open to the world, however, we have begun to conceive of a universal principle of sentience, a broad threshold of moral reasoning which all sentient species can be said to have achieved. After all, even humans are not quite as dense as tchoken.\n\nBy virtue of our most ancient tradition, we have come to be more refined than others… but this is a function of time, not morality. We are unique among sentients, but all sentients are capable of steadily working towards high civilisation some time in the future. Promulgating this new understanding will do much to reconcile our institutions to the opening of our society."

 monstrous.211.d:0 "The memory of Karassk runs deep among the humans of Sarhal, to the point that in some rural dialects, Karassk is used as a catch-all term for lizardfolk civilisation. The humans view the dominion of Karassk as a dark stain on their history, a period of repression and misery at the point of our swords, their hopes and dreams ground into the dirt. It’s all terribly dramatic, and they will not stop going on about it.\n\nA gesture of apology for the acts of Karassk, however detached from our current government and way of life, might go a long way to thaw our frigid relationship with humanity. But it is a lowering of ourselves, however one spins it."

Allowing this will almost certainly annoy the elites in our capital, who must now mingle with upstart outsiders, but selectively approving such embassies is a good way to foster relationships with those realms we deem worthy."
 monstrous.214.a:0 "As long as the embassy isn’t near the bathhouse."
 monstrous.214.b:0 "They do not merit our consideration."
 
 monstrous.215.t:0 "Monstrous Stupidity"
 monstrous.215.d:0 "A stateswoman does not concern herself with the clearing of leaves from the bendbark gutters; we have never particularly concerned ourselves with the disapproval of fools and foreigners. Faced with by far the most venerable civilisation in the world, the various human savages who flank Taneyas fester in their impotent jealousy, declaring us monsters. We gather that the flayed humans who of late wander south to Vyzemby are even more ignorant and blinkered in this regard.\n\nSuch a status quo raises problems both pragmatic and prideful. This negative perception marginalises our envoys and merchants, hindering our efforts abroad, and that is bad enough. More fundamentally, we cannot brook the indignity of their continued ignorance. A hundred golden ages had passed for us before these people had so much as learned to fix flint to a meagre bit of wood. It is high time they understood this."
 monstrous.215.a:0 "Our civilising mission begins."
 
 monstrous.216.t:0 "Alike in Dignity"
 monstrous.216.d:0 "Translations of our works sit in libraries across the world. When foreigners visit, they show the proper wonder and deference as they walk under our ancient gates, knowing that the buildings they glimpse are older than their entire cultures. Though the niceties are still awkward, we now receive envoys more or less smoothly, and can compel them through politeness to show dignified deference to our leaders. This is the lesson of the lizardfolk: adapt if you must, but maintain your dignity. Never allow the world to see you needily scrape, or they will replace ‘monster’ with ‘beggar’ and continue quite merrily with their disrespect.\n\nWe are the standard bearers for the oldest civilisation on Halann, and this legacy now garners the respect it should. Never will we sacrifice the principles which make us great."
 monstrous.216.a:0 "The rest of the world has been civilised."
