You gave so much of yourself to a future you would never see and when the Greentide came, it swept away the fruits of your labour, scattering your hopes like leaves in the wind.\n\nAnd yet, in that loss, you gave us something enduring. Beneath the ash and ruin, the roots you planted still hold firm. I will try, but I know that I cannot bring you back, nor give back what the war stole. But I can rebuild what was yours. I will raise Ayethstir from its knees, father. I will finish what you began, and in doing so, I will honour the man you were before sorrow claimed you."

Words were spoken, or left unsaid. And when her grandmother fell to the Greentide, that final thread between us seemed to fray beyond repair. She withdrew, and I did not follow. Perhaps I could not. Now she walks beside Alara, and I tell myself that love has found her, the kind I once failed to provide. Perhaps that is enough. But there are nights I wonder if she still remembers that I am her father, not merely by name, but by some gentler memory we once shared. I do not know.\n\nIf the Salla Cenág choose to hear me, if my plea for unity is not in vain, then perhaps the wound might yet close.

And perhaps, when the dust has settled, when the bone-hoarders are scattered and the grove breathes again, my daughter will see me not as the shadow of a father, but as a man of his word.

If the Arrow Grove is to endure, it must become a true fortress. We shall raise palisades between the roots, line the forest floor with traps, and mark the skyline with watchtowers.

They strike because they must, because hunger guides them. And in war, in the rot of grief, we often mistake necessity for instinct and vengeance for purpose.\n\nBut we are not beasts. Or at least… we were not. What sets us apart, what once lifted us above the fang and the claw, was choice - a hidden quiet voice that tells us we could walk away. That we could be better. And yet, I have not walked away. I have remained. I have sunk lower than I thought possible. The pits of despair are not bottomless, I have learned. They have a floor, and I sometimes feel as if I watched them from below.\n\nSo, since I am already here - since my soul has weathered what I thought it could not endure - could I forge this ruin into something greater?. Shape despair into resolve? One raid. One act. One silence after the scream. If it is monstrous to do this, so be it, but if one stroke of cruelty can reverse the tide that drowned the Deepwoods, who would not be willing to sacrifice his soul?"

 flavour_ayeth.1.d:0 "I have returned with my warband to the outskirts of Ayethstir. Not as victors, not yet, but our excursion deep into the enemy lines was quite successful.\n\nThe path here winds through groves older than these invaders, where the trees are too ancient to bend and too proud to bloom. Their roots twist like the fingers of old sentinels and with each step we take, the ground groans with the hollow breath of limestone veins that run deep and wide beneath our home. Our Grove was never peaceful, but it was also never silent. Now? Even the caverns below us are quiet.\n\nAyethstir itself stands untouched for now. There is no siege, no watchfire in the hills, no horn or drum sounding from the dark. The gates of the city are closed, but not broken. The faded green banners with crossed silver arrows are faded, yet they still proudly weave in the breeze. There is no smoke on the horizon, only the rustle of ancient leaves and the faint scent of moss and stone. The air is tight, as if the forest itself was holding its breath. In the silence I can hear my rangers whisper that the orcs move like shadows in their encampments, gathering in gladeways and valleys. They have not yet struck. But they will.\n\nIn the stillness, I think of my mother. I think of what we lost when the Blackmoon came. And I think of what I have become in chasing them from grove to grove, leaving only blood and broken messages in their wake. Ayethstir will not fall again. We will not wait behind its walls and hope the trees protect us or the caverns collapse below their feet. The forest is calm now. And before the sound of war drums reaches our land, I must go to the inner hall, where my father awaits for we have words yet to speak."

 flavour_ayeth.2.t:0 "The Silent Throne"
 flavour_ayeth.2.d:0 "The great hall of Ayethstir is quieter now than it ever was in war. No commands are barked, no horns, no drums, no thrum of drawn bowstrings - just the hush that follows after something truly valuable breaks. Outside, the wind tugs at the bones of the roof, prying loose planks with hollow groans. The rafters above me creak like the limbs of a dying tree. Dead leaves drift in through open slats, gathering in wood-hewn corners. My boots are soft against the ruined floor, not daring to disturb the accusatory silence that surrounds me, asking me if I know what I’m doing. I do not.\n\nHe is here, my father. Not at the highseat, not standing with his hunting cloak billowing like clouds of thunder behind him, no. He sits beneath it now, his back to the stone, knees drawn in like a child. His cloak clings to him like burial cloth, eyes open but unfocused. Dull. Clouded. Not seeing anything. I stop just before him. I want to speak, but the words feel caught, like a hand meeting a knar on an armrest of a chair.\n\n“Father.” - No answer. Only the sound of the wind scratching at the doors. I crouch beside him. My hand touches his shoulder, yet his body does not flinch, just sags more deeply into itself. “Father. Look at me.”\n\nHis gaze finally shifts, a familiar flicker in them - now dim and weak, like a coal losing its glow. “You cannot lead like this,” I say. “If you will not stand, then please let me.” A long pause, a blink, a slow, brittle turn of the old head and at last, words - dry and cracked:\n\n“And what would you do, Elaria? March through every glade, torch every warren, spill blood until the pain fades?” he asks.\n\n“I would act, because someone has to. Father, you mourn, we all do, but you mourn like you’re already dead.” My words pierce him like an arrow pierces the hide of an ancient stag.“Father, I did not come to beg, I came to ask. One last time.”\n\nHis hands reach for the clasp as his shoulder and unfasten his cloak. He pushes its weight into my palm. “I will not stop you,” he says, barely louder than a breath."

 flavour_ayeth.3.t:0 "Final Farewell"
 flavour_ayeth.3.d:0 "The mound I dug is still fresh. The soil does not yet know how to hold loss, refusing to accept him. I planted his bow above him. The string is frayed, the wood cracked and dry. One limb bends where it should not. It is useless now, but it stands taller than me. On it I hang the cloak he gave me six years ago. The wind stirs it, softly. It is not enough to move branches, but just enough to sound like a breath that escaped from lungs of a tired warrior.\n\n“Father…” It scrapes out of me, like I had never said it before. And maybe I had not, at least not like this. “You too… you too have left me.” My words are too loud in the quiet, they echo in my ribs as my mind is filled with one thought and one thought only…\n\n“I am alone now.” The thought swirls in my head, clawing my eyelids, trying to open them and force them to let out a tear down my cheek. It does not happen. “I bled for these woods, I bled for you…” I say, my voice cracking. “... What good is vengeance if you’re not here to see it? What good is justice to the souls of the dead?”\n\nMy voice rises, “you’ve told me to hold back, that restraint was the mark of a true ceann… and look where that led us. Look!” I strike the ground. Pain rings up my arm, but it is distant, dull, like I was watching myself do it, instead of feeling it myself.\n\n“I would give everything for one more night by the fire, one more walk without words by your side.” My vision blurs, but still the brook of my tears dares not escape. “I carry the salla now and I do not know how to do it without you watching. I do not know how to be anything but what is left… I am not strong, father. I never was. I am just…”"

 flavour_ayeth.4.t:0 "Lament of Elaria"
 flavour_ayeth.4.d:0 "He came at dusk, when the campfires had just begun to crackle and the scent of roasted roots lingered in the air. A traveling minstrel - soft-spoken, humble, bearing little more than a satchel and a weather-worn lute. He asked for nothing, only offered a song in exchange for warmth. It was a rare moment of quiet, of stillness in the war-born rhythm of my days. I allowed him to play. His fingers danced along the strings, and the his mouth began a song:\n\nBeneath the ash, the roots still cling,\nTo voices lost, to vanished spring.\nShe bore the bow, he wore the crown -\nBoth sleep beneath the forest’s frown.\n\nShe watched the stars from blood-soaked floor,\nAnd gave a breath that stilled him sore.\nHe wept in stone, not for lost land,\nBut for the touch of her lost hand.\n\nBut in a moment, autumn-brief,\nHis heart gave way beneath his grief.\nAnd when he cast the Ayeth crest,\nHe joined her in eternal rest.\n\n…\n\nO child of grief, O branch once green—\nWhat price to cleanse what none have seen?\nHow could your soul remain the same,\nWhen naught is left but fleeting name?\n\nI stood before I knew I had moved. My hands trembled - not from rage, but from the sudden, suffocating tide of memory crashing through the dam I had built inside myself.\n\n“No more,” I whispered. With one motion, I seized the lute from his hands and hurled it against the stone. The strings snapped like sinew. The body splintered with a sickening crack. Wood scattered across the moss. Realizing what I had done, I hang my head and whispered:"
 flavour_ayeth.4.a:0 "“I… I am sorry. I could not control my anger. Can you repeat the song?”"
 flavour_ayeth.4.b:0 "“The only string you should stir is the one of a bow. We need to win, not remember.”"

 flavour_ayeth.5.t:0 "Eaglesighted"
 flavour_ayeth.5.d:0 "I see him.\n\nHe is not a chieftain in my eyes, nor a warrior - just a shadow hunched against the treeline, draped in the stink of old blood. The one who murdered my mother. The one who tore open the world I once called home. Every night since that day, I’ve remembered his eyes - small, dark, unblinking. I dreamt of them glinting in the dark, above her broken body.\n\nAnd now, here he is. Real. In flesh. Within the reach of my bow.\n\nBut I will wait. My rangers have already been sent ahead. They will find every runner he dispatches, every emissary sent to rouse the other tribes. One by one, they will vanish. He will call for aid, and no one will come.\n\nLet him feel, for once, what I have felt ever since he took my world from me. I will savour his fear, his loneliness. I want him to feel trapped. Cornered. I want to see his panic bloom as he realises the net has already closed. I want to see his head jerk toward the arrow I loose to make him know I am here.\n\nAnd when his thoughts are naught but fearful, when his heart pounds audibly in his chest, when his breath is short from panic and the sense of impending doom - then, I will let loose one arrow.\n\nAnd when it lands, he will know why he dies."

 flavour_ayeth.6.d:0 "The Elf comes.\n\nThat cursed wretch from the Grove of Arrows, riding high with his proud feathers; Elaria Ayeth, they call him. The sapling prince, who marches his kin to our border like we won’t see them - like we don’t own every shadow in this part of the Deepwoods.\n\nOur scouts lie dead, yes. Throats slit, bodies vanished. But it matters not. Let them think their little ambush means something, that we fear him.\n\nLet them come.\n\nBlackmoon waits with a thirst for blood. The Elf rides to his doom, and with him, the last breath of Salla Ayeth. We will crush their line, tear up their roots, and feed the forest our triumph."

 flavour_ayeth.7.t:0 "One Arrow is Enough"
 flavour_ayeth.7.d:0 "One shot was enough. I let it loose in silence, while the battle raged at my side. No cry of vengeance, no roar of fury, just the soft pull of string, the whisper of release.\n\nThe arrow cut the wind cleanly. I watched it spin, watched the fletching vanish into the dusk; by the time a single breath had passed, it had struck.\n\nRight beneath the collarbone - where flesh thins and bone cradles the heart - a perfect shot. He staggered, put one foot forward, then another, then none.\n\nHis eyes widened. He looked down as if trying to understand what had happened, as if he still held the power to undo it and command his body to hold on, but it was already too late for commands.\n\nHe will try, surely; he will clutch the shaft, break it in half and gasp with his mouth full of blood, spitting curses I will not hear. He will plead to Dookan, perhaps, and then he will crawl to drag his bones towards his army that will carry him to their war camp. Maybe he will try to escape.\n\nBut there is no escape.\n\nOnly the embrace of death awaits him now. It will not be a clean death, it will not be swift.\n\nI must make haste to the warband – I must be the one to deliver the final blow."

 flavour_ayeth.8.t:0 "Eclipse of the Blackmoon"
 flavour_ayeth.8.d:0 "As the last sounds of battle faded into the distance, the smoke of burning tents and broken barricades still lingered in the air. My army had broken through the crude palisades of the Blackmoon war camp with brutal efficiency. Cries of surrender were already beginning to echo from the far end of the camp. But I was not there for their surrender.\n\nWith my personal retinue of rangers, I made for the warcamp’s heart. Inside, the dim firelight flickered against crude idols and war trophies. And there, slumped against the far wall beneath a banner with their eponymous symbol, lay the chieftain of the Blackmoon clan. Wounded, broken, barely breathing. One hand pressed weakly against his chest where the first arrow had struck. The wound had bled freely. He would not have lasted long. But long enough for this.\n\nI stepped forward in the silent hall and crouched beside him. His eyes opened - small, dark, and glassy with pain. Perhaps he recognized me. Perhaps he only saw a shadow. I held the arrow in my hand, gripped tight enough for my knuckles to pale. I placed the tip against his neck - at the hollow where his pulse stuttered, where my mother had been struck all those years ago. I drove the arrow in.\n\nA short gasp. Stillness. Not even a rattle. It was done.\n\nThe chieftain of the Blackmoon Orcs was dead, the killer of my mother was gone. And with him, whatever unity his brute will had forced upon the others collapsed like the walls of their shoddy fortress. The bonds between him and his kin shattered the moment my arrow found his throat. The orcs value strength; once their leader collapses, they go into disarray."

 flavour_ayeth.9.t:0 "Vengeance"
 flavour_ayeth.9.d:0 "Now they are cornered. Driven from their villages into the limestone gullies that twist beneath the roots of the Arrow Grove, they have nowhere left to run. In the cracks and caverns I can see them; goblins and orcs, teeming as one. There are elders among them.. There are women shielding the young, faces turned upward in terror. And children. Small. Frightened, with their eyes wide, trying to disappear into the stone.\n\nAnd that fear in their eyes… I have seen that fear before. Years ago, when our warriors were cut down and Ayethstir burned, when the boughs above dripped with the blood of my kin, stumbling through smoke and flame and ruin. Their faces were twisted by the same horror, the same frozen helplessness.\n\nIt is justice, is it not? I want to say yes, that this is retribution, that this is what they deserve, that what I do now is only the echo of what they began. Yet when I look at them, I feel no justice inside of me. No satisfaction. I search there for the certainty and clarity I once had, when my wounds were fresh and my rage was honest, but I find none. The lines blur; were they ever clear at all? They are the children of those who brought death to my door, but should the son atone for the sins of his father? Does the weight of their lineage damn them to find their end by my arrows? And if I strike now, if I give the order and watch arrows fall… Do I truly punish evil or do I become it?\n\nIs this an order… or a murder?"

In the depths of war, Selussa seized the refugees who fled from Salla Ahain and Salla Scotha and twisted their minds with dreams not their own.\n\nShe claims she was trying to rebuild – to do so, she was forced to co-opt the wills of the broken. I step forward and her eyes meet mine.\n\n“Elaria,” she says softly, “Ah, your eyes are your mother’s!”\n\nI do not answer her flattery.\n\n“You have enslaved the wounded, Selussa,” I say. “You have made puppets of those who had nowhere to go.”\n\n“I gave them purpose,” she replies. “I gave them a Grove again. I gave them unity.”\n\n“At the cost of their minds?”\n\n“Better to serve in a dream than rot in despair.”\n\nI take a step closer and she does not flinch.\n\n“You were not the only one who lost a home.”\n\n“No,” she says.\n\nI look at the people she has enthralled. They stand like husks behind her, still breathing, still warm, but hollow-eyed. We stare at one another - two remnants of a lost world, standing in the ruins of their hopes."

 flavour_ayeth.11.d:0 "The first light of dawn has just begun to touch the leaves above me, their edges burning faint gold. But here, beneath the canopies of Arrow Grove, the shadows still linger. I stand before a small pond which reflects the sky above.\n\nIt is quiet. No birds sing, no wind howls… just the slow breath of forest and the pulse that drums behind my eyes. I used to come here with my mother, when I was but a sapling who yearned to see the world. We used to look at the pond together and marvel at the water disturbed by a slow breeze. She told me once…\n\n“Water remembers us, Elaria.” - I hear the voice. Not in my head, no, I can hear it coming from the pond beneath me. I look at my tired face and I do not see it, but I see her delicate face.\n\n“Mother?” I ask, for a heartbeat believing that she is still with me. Yet even as an apparition of my own mind, the image in the crystal clear water does not change. Whatever tricks my mind, or local fey, play on me, they are here to stay. I kneel, hands digging into the moss at the edge. \n\n“You’ve changed,” she says in her gentle voice. “What has happened to you Elaria? Why are you continuing on this path?\n\n“I must do it, mother,” I say, my voice rising louder than I intended. “I cannot rest until the Deepwoods still bleed. I must clear this wound, go through the Feyrealm, through the veil. Strike every single warren. Kill every single orc. I cannot stop until they are gone.”\n\n“And then?” she asks. “When there is no one left to kill, who will you be?”\n\nI feel my chest cave in. I lower my head and I whisper. “I do not know. I do not care. I just want them to feel what I feel. I want the world to scream like I did the day they tore you from me.”\n\n“Elaria… you need to let go of the past. You need to forgive yourself for your mistakes and let others fill the void my departure has left in you. Please, my son.”\n\n“I cannot.” I respond.\n\n“Why?”"

Weathered and scarred, yet at the same time enduring and alive.\n\nI walk the paths of the Deepwoods once again. There was a time when each stone in Ayethstir was a tomb to the death, every root a grave of a world I had failed to protect. Laughter felt like a sin against those who are no longer among us, as if joy had no right to return to a place that had lost so much. But now…\n\nI enter the renovated great hall and under the canopies I hear my dear daughter scalding her love. “Alara,” - she says - “You must be more patient, I will not always be there to fix the situation for you!” I look at the eyes of my mother, once again fretting over loved ones – I cannot help but smile. I no longer wake up with the name of my mother caught in my throat, nor do I see my father’s gaze in every shadowed corner. Instead my sleep ends when a child laughs too loud outside of my room; wherever I look I see saplings aspiring to bring Ayeth to greatness.\n\nThis weight I had in me… It never truly leaves. It never can, but I have learnt how to live with it. How to conjure it in moments of weakness and turn the bitterness of separation into a foundation of strength. There are moments - quiet, fleeting - when I feel the sun on my face and do not think of the pyres, when I pass the carved stone bearing my father’s name and I do not fall to my knees. When I say my mother’s name - Vehari - and it does not taste like ash.\n\nThere was a time I feared healing, as if forgetting pain meant betraying their memory. As if letting go, meant letting them die for nothing. But I understand now, they did not want me to burn in their names, they wanted me to live. And it is because of you that I still do.\n\nYou could have let me slip into vengeance, let me drown in blood and call it justice. You could have turned your face from mine and let me rot in silence, but you did not. You stayed. You stood beside me when I was no longer worthy of it and bore the weight I could not carry. You gave me something I could not find in myself - the belief that I was not beyond saving. Because of you, Salla Ayeth lives."

The Wood Elves kneel to me; the goblin warrens have been burned, their bones fed to the roots; orcish warbands lie scattered, hunted to the last. The eastern groves whisper only in elven tongues once more, for there are no more monsters in these woods.\n\nAnd yet, when I walk the ancient paths of Ayethstir - I feel nothing. The air is the same. The trees still arch like vaults of a tomb above me and in their shade I find no comfort, their silence no longer soothes. Some say that the forest sings again. That children dance in the boughs, that lovers once again carve their names into bark and festivals rise beneath moonlight.\n\nBut I… I feel nothing. No warmth, no pride, no peace. I killed for her. I bled for her memory. I shattered our alliances, I hunted those who betrayed us, I made monsters fear my name, I tore through the rot with my arrows, I made sure no one would ever forget what was done to her.\n\n	And now, there is no one left to kill. The silence remains. The grief is no longer loud. It does not scream in my head; it merely sits beside me each night, like an old companion – quiet, familiar and utterly unmovable. There is no redemption, no triumph, no moment where the pain lifts and the sun breaks through, only the endless, choking question: Was this what she would have wanted? - No. No, she would have wept. I see her face when I close my eyes. For years, I wore her memory like a cloak, but every step I took dragged me further from who she loved.\n\nAnd you… You stood behind me. You, who called this strength, who chose this path. You, who let me fall, again and again, because you wanted vengeance too, did you not? Because it was satisfying, because blood is easier than healing.\n\nSo look at me now! Look at what you have made. Do not turn your gaze away - I am a ruler. I am feared. I am victorious.

Not a question, not even a surprise. My warriors bowed, turned back on their heels and left. When the great door shut behind them, silence came rushing back. I was left alone with the echo of my own voice, standing there, motionless, and staring at the space where my mother once walked… This will not bring her back. I know that… and yet, I gave the order, did I not?\n\nI cannot confide in anyone, not even my daughter for if I did, they would reassure me in my ways.

Revenge?\n\nI saw what they did to her and to the villages. I heard the screams. And I know - I know - that they would do it again if they could, so I ordered their end. Not for peace or for safety - for silence.\n\nNot of them - of me. Of the voice in my head that screams every night, of the pain that walks beside me like a shadow that will not leave. Will it help?

They use his name to justify their weakness.\n\nI cannot understand it anymore. I have tried. I have sat beneath the trees at night, staring up into the boughs where I once played as a child - wondering if perhaps I am the one who strayed, if perhaps the world moved on and I remained. But every time I close my eyes, I see them. The dead. My friends. My mother. My warriors. Torn apart, their faces mangled with pain, dying on soil that was meant to keep us safe.\n\nAnd now my kin would have me agree to yet another loss? That my rangers who have bled for the broken clans are simply to be forgotten? Their blood nourishing the trees, whose shadow was to shield the children of cowards who fled?\n\nI feel the world crumbling around me. I look at them and I no longer see family, I see strangers wearing familiar faces, speaking empty words of cowardice. They say I have forsaken the role of a leader - but how could I lead my people while listening to the orders of those who spit on the graves of our fallen?

Yet even in the madness, there came a stillness. A moment in which all the world held its breath. The Deepwoods were silent, save for one.\n\nThere he stood - Oberon Fealgarn - astride a great stag wreathed in the light of fey, his hair wild, his voice rising above the din. Commanding, untouched by blood, yet visibly tired and ravaged by the horrors of constant war, he towered over the melee. He pointed eastward with his glaive, driving the orcs further away from our homes. The tide was turning.\n\nMy bow was already drawn. He had ushered this same command before, in another grove many years ago. He had told his clan to follow him on his mad gambit, leading orcs through the Eastern Groves. He led them through the Flower Grove, the River Grove, the Shadow Grove, up until the Arrow Grove, while the orcish horde rampaged in pursuit, razing to the ground all they encountered. Including the small village next to Yffnu Ynde, where my mother fell.\n\nI felt my mother’s hand on my shoulder, her screams… The long silence that followed. And how this silence was broken now - a hero atop a beast, lauded by those who had not buried what I buried. One arrow. That’s all it would take. A missed step, a rogue shaft let loose in the smoke and confusion of the battle, his stag rearing in panic, the forest swallowing the sound of the bowstring.\n\nThere are things we must never admit aloud - not even to ourselves. Things that cannot be put to trial, or laid to rest - only acted upon. I let the arrow loose…"

 flavour_ayeth.17.d:0 "It is so… cold. I can feel it now. It seeps not from the wound - I’ve long bled past pain. That fire passed me by some time ago. What lingers is something quieter, more cruel. It is the cold of something leaving, the cold of a life uncoiling. The warmth of breath drifting from my chest like a summer breeze on the first day of autumn. I try to hold it in, just a little longer, but it slips, it always slips.\n\nI do not know how long I’ve been lying here, nestled between the roots of a fallen yew. My back rests against its bark like a cradle, and my legs stretch out into a bed of withered moss. The sky above me is broken in patches, glimpsed between twisted branches that tear away the light of day. My hand still curls around my bow, slick with blood. I think it is mine. My fingers twitch, reaching for a string they will never pull again. As if my body, even now, cannot understand that it is over.\n\nI have spent my life in pursuit of monsters. I hunted them through the hollows of Deepwoods, I struck from shadows, silent as the wind and relentless as the storm. I learned how to kill, because I did not know how to live. Because I was too afraid of the stillness that might come if I ever stopped.\n\nAnd always - always - I carried her death with me. A grief that hollowed my ribs and twisted my heart. I never let it go. I could not. I feared that if I did, I would forget her face. I walked through the fire of betrayal, death of comrades and fracture of my people, but I kept going because the arrow does not turn mid-flight.\n\nI should have gone to her when I had the chance; I should have run. I should have held her, while she still had breath to whisper goodbye. When I found her, she was already cold. Her eyes stared upward, fixed on the stars I’ve refused to look at since. I am sorry, mother. I am so, so sorry.\n\nThe forest is quiet, but it is not empty. I can feel the trees watching, the soil pressing gently beneath me, accepting me. The roots curl around my limbs like vines, as if the grove itself mourned. At least that is what I would like to believe… and then I hear her, in the stillness of my mind. “Please, my son,” she whispers. “Let go.”\n\nAnd I want to answer her. I try, I open my mouth, but no words come, no air."

 flavour_ayeth.18.d:0 "Ever since that day… I have not wept.\n\nAs I strode across the forest canopies of the Arrow Grove, the sky’s light was almost blinding, and the birdsong felt deafening. Ever since that day, I’ve done everything in my power to avoid walking the paths of the Grove. Not out of fear of the limestone caverns beneath, for my emaciated body could scarcely hope to break through their roofs. No, it is not the depths I fear. It is the surface itself.\n\nThe memory. The imprint burned into my eyes.\n\nI still see her – crumpled on the forest floor like fallen bark. Her chest torn open by a gushing wound, her eyes wide, unblinking. No last words. No goodbye.\n\nI remember how I tightened my grip on my bow and approached her… approached it… what once had been her. I did not rush. I could not. The very air had thickened, as though trying to keep me from crossing that final distance. My fingers locked tighter around the bowstring, as if it alone could tether me to the moment, as if holding it firm enough might keep the world from unraveling.\n\nYet it did and now I live in a world I do not recognize.\n\nEach day I wake, I feel a distinct burden pressed beneath my ribs, lodged in the center of my chest, just above my left lung. It does not fade when I speak. It does not lift when I eat. Music does not reach it. It stays with me - unchanged, never letting me take a full breath. Only my tears can dissolve it, little by little."

They say they remember.\n\nBut I remember silence. Not the peace of it - no, not that. The silence after. After her cry shattered the morning stillness. After the forest answered with nothing at all. After no reinforcements came.\n\nWhere were they, these siblings of ours, when the sky turned black with smoke? Where were their rangers when my mother screamed her last breath into the roots of the Grove? Where were their healers, their blades, their words?\n\nNow they come, cloaked in good intentions, hands outstretched as if they had never let go. Now they speak of the Verdant Pact, of Deepwoods solidarity. Now, when the soil is wet with blood we buried alone.\n\nDo not speak to me of shared blood, “kin”."

The gloom of early morning resolved itself. Joints cracked as I sat up. I laced my boots slowly, as if learning how, the tips of fingers fumbling across worn leather and frayed cords.\n\nOutside, the camp stirred with the rustle of steel, leather and wood. Rangers moved through the trees; some talked one with another, others sharpened their blades or arrows on whetstones. The murmurs of conversation and the metal scratching the stone rang in my head.\n\nI came closer to the fire to feel some of the warmth; despite the flames almost licking my hands, my forearms and shoulders were almost frozen. I could barely move them without an unpleasant jolt - stiffness? injury?. After quite some time, I ate the rations that were prepared for me, chewing mechanically.\n\nI turned my face towards the rising sun. I spotted a pair of jackdaws in close formation, flying low. I tracked them closely until a burning sensation forced me to blink. When I opened them, the birds were gone.\n\nI am not sure if this day was a year ago or if I am simply describing this morning."

Their voices once wrapped around me like roots in warm soil - soft songs under starlight, the old greetings exchanged at conclaves, promises carved into oaths and etched into bark. I remember their gifts. I remember their smiles. But I wish I did not.\n\nWhen my mother was dying, not a horn was blown. Not a glaive lifted. Not a single step was taken toward Ayethstir as it burned. Refugees escaped their demise at our expense, at my expense! I held my mother’s body with shaking hands while the flames still crept on the wind. I waited for our allies. I waited for days. For weeks. Long enough for my father to rot in the shadow of their silence.\n\nWhen my father went to Elynáile to attend the conclave and listen to the words being said, I sallied out of our encampments, tracking and killing the lieutenants of the murderer of my mother, returning only because I saw that without my guiding hand my father would lose himself to grief and forsake our future.\n\nSome might think it is too late for vengeance. That the time for reckoning has passed. But I have not forgotten. I have carved each name, each clan, each betrayal into the shaft of my arrows. I whisper them when I draw the bow, hoping it shall find the target true. I see before my eyes how they are struck and just for a brief moment we are once again equals. For a brief moment the emptiness of my hollowed chest is shared with them.\n\nNo more kin. Let them weep their empty tears. Let them offer peace now, as if their cowardice was not already paid in blood. They think me broken, think me mad. Perhaps I am. But they have made me this. They molded this shape with every refusal, every silence, every blind eye turned as goblins and orcs tore my home apart."

No one wants to speak of the last who tried.\n\nBut there is still one truth - he is mortal. Flesh and bone beneath all that rage and grief. And if we can strike him down, if we can watch him fall, then perhaps the madness gripping Salla Ayeth will break. Without him, the clan will lose its spine - the vengeance that drives them will shatter. They’ll scatter like dry leaves in the wind.\n\nWe must kill him. In battle, face to face.

I care only for the trail of blood that leads me toward what must be done.\n\nTheir guards tried to save them. Carried them through back passages, hid them beneath stone. But I have hunted prey far more cunning. I find them lying in the dim light of their own throne room, shivering, barely breathing - a ruler only in name now, not unlike my father all those years ago. There are no last words. No chance for defiance or redemption. I draw my blade and let the steel speak in place of me.\n\nWe are done here. The ruler is dead.

These faces I once called family now meeting me like I’m some stranger on a black road.\n\n“I’m not here to issue orders,” I begin, voice low. “And I’m not here to ask for forgiveness. We need each other’s help. I need Cenág’s warriors in the east and you need my rangers to retake your grove. Let me help you.”\n\n“No,” she says.\n\nLanhara’s hand brushes her arm. “Al…”\n\nAlara turns to her. “He has led our people to ruin before.”\n\n“You know that’s not fair,” Lanhara says.\n\n“I don’t care,” Alara snaps. “He abandoned kith and kin to die in the fields while he chased his vengeance. I won’t let him do that to my clan.”\n\n“You’re right,” I say. “I left. I became someone unrecognizable. And I do not expect you to follow a ghost who burned his own path through the forest. But this same ghost has retaken his home and makes you a vow,” I continue, stepping closer. “Give me the warriors of Cenág, and I will retake the Bone Grove too. And if I fail, I step aside, you become ceanna again.”\n\nAlara closes her eyes. Breathes in slowly. Then she turns to my daughter and asks.\n\n“Do you trust him, Hara?” - my daughter nods.\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\n“You have five years, áthyr'ionn,” Alara says. “No more. No less.”"

Lanhara leans against a pillar behind her, arms crossed, expression unreadable. Her eyes will not meet mine.\n\n“I promised five years,” I begin, but Alara’s voice cuts through mine like the blade she carries: “And you failed.”\n\n“I did what I could—”\n\n“What you could?” She interrupts me again. “You led our warriors to die in your chase for vengeance. Five years of hoping you still remembered the meaning of an oath; five years of growing realization that you do not.”\n\nAs she stops, Lanhara starts to speak. There is a tremor in her voice - “You made a promise. You made a promise to Cenág, and you used our people to die in your campaigns. Do you have any idea how long I have waited for my father to come back… And this… This is who returns?”\n\nAnd for the first time since that night something broke inside of me.\n\n “I bled for you. For both of you and your damned clan! While you sat in these halls and did nothing, I took my bow and hunted. So what if I had hunted the eastern flank before my promise came to fruition? An oath has more value in your eyes than freeing our lands?!” I turn my eyes to Lanhara. “And you… You talk of love like it is conditional. Like it lives only when I am safe, when I am still. But you never saw what I saw. You never held the dying in your arms and promised their deaths would mean something!”\n\nLanhara finally looks at me. In her face I see my mother’s plea.
