 F29_zokka_second_light_desc:0 ""My father is the Pack Lord, and I am my father's son.\n\nI've been told very little of the circumstances of my birth. I know that my mother was another gnoll, but not her name, nor her character. I know that my father doesn't seem to miss her. The few words he's said about her seem to indicate that he never particularly cared at all. All of his mortal desires seem to pale in the face of his divine urge.\n\nI know that I am necessary. Should my father pass before achieving his dream, his pack and goal will fall to me. That is the burden I must bear.\n\nThe First Sun rose, and earned my father's ire. Its vassal now lies dead, half in the sand and half in the stomach. As it rises once more, does it know what is to come?""
 F29_zokka_youngest_sun_title:0 "The Youngest Sun"
 F29_zokka_youngest_sun_desc:0 ""There was a moment, on that battlefield, where I paused.\n\nI watched a people stand and fight for what they believe in. Their creed. Their god, still valiantly fighting against the darkness. I felt their pride, and their desperation, as they faced us head on - even as they fell in scores and their leader was devoured.\n\nMy father and his generals celebrated their failure, but I could barely stomach it. I wonder if that's why he won. I wonder if that's why I hesitate.\n\nI've convinced him to spare their mountain. Call me sentimental... but maybe they'll return one day.""

 F29_zokka_scorched_gardens_title:0 "Scorched Gardens"
 F29_zokka_scorched_gardens_desc:0 ""The monarchs of Bulwar seek to rule over what already exists. This is why, I think, a gnoll is not a King, but a Pack Lord. We're supposed to destroy, and claim whatever stronger thing grows in destruction's place. Empty territory, stripped bare, can be remade in the Pack Lord's image. That which is breakable isn't worth governing.""

 F29_zokka_pack_pre_eminence_desc:0 ""I've seen the gnolls of other packs - warriors I used to fear - crawl on their bellies just to please my father. I can't even blame them, such is his gravitas.\n\nThey don't all bow out of fear, of course. Some do so simply because it's wise. Others seem to think him a kind of prophesied leader, or a god-to-be. I try to avoid those ones, who dream of a world after the First Sun. Still, loyalty is loyalty, I suppose.""

 F29_zokka_birds_of_a_feather_desc:0 ""I always felt that the harpies were loyal allies. They are fast, and fierce, and sharp, and beautiful; like lightning. They called my father Pack Lord. Sang his name from the cliffs to celebrate his victory.\n\nHe calls them useful. He says they seek a portion of the conquest, and that's why they serve. Not out of love, or faith - out of a wish for growth. A pact of convenience, for both sides. A pact my father seeks to break.""

 F29_zokka_as_the_harpy_flies_desc:0 ""Our rituals tell stories. It's a unique language, but a language nonetheless - symbols, names, and words spoken in order. A script, complete with a beginning and an end.\n\nThe power behind them lies in those words, but also in the blood. Each sacrifice gives the rite another voice. The more you feed it, the louder it gets. The further down it reaches.\n\nOurs will be deafening.""

 F29_zokka_zokka_entheate_title:0 "Zokka, Entheate"
 F29_zokka_zokka_entheate_desc:0 ""I do not understand why my father seeks the First Sun. He speaks of it as a conquest, or some great revenge, or a necessity. Always, his words are tinged with longing - as though it holds some missing part of him.\n\nBut then, I watched him devour the Commander. I saw the joy he took in it. I saw his triumph.\n\nI don't think there's some secret design he has yet to teach. I think his motivation is simple - he wishes to eat the First Sun out of want. He likes how it burns, and how it doesn't burn out, and he wants to become something just as eternal.\n\nI don't know if I want the same thing. Sometimes, I think I inherited only his fur.""

 F29_zokka_ashes_renewed_desc:0 ""After that victory - the first I'd witnessed personally - my father stood in the dust until the First Sun set, gazing upwards. Simply breathing deep, as if committing the scent of the battlefield to memory. A finality, but also a beginning.\n\nI knew, then, that the peace I seek isn't the same as his. Mine is restful, and prosperous. His is... digestive - a slow, grinding absorption of culture, custom, and resistance.\n\nConquest is cutting, and war is the knife. All that remains is the work.""
 F29_zokka_northern_blades_title:0 "The Northern Blades"
 F29_zokka_northern_blades_desc:0 ""There were threats to our hinterlands we needed to consider.\n\nFirst: the horse men of the plains could have, in theory, crossed the mountain pass between us. We would have won, I'm sure, but any conflict would've be costly. At the time, they appeared preoccupied fighting each other - whilst they were busy drawing the blood of their peers, I believed us wise to strike fast and early. A buffer in the region could have served us very well indeed.""
 F29_zokka_southern_fires_title:0 "The Southern Fires"
 F29_zokka_southern_fires_desc:0 ""Second: we were not a naval power, and we lacked the resources to become one in a timely manner. That did not mean we couldn't defend our southern flank, however. I was concerned that coastal powers from the Raj would see our weakness and cut open our underbelly. A semi-permanent system of felflame pyres, strategically placed along our beaches and cliffs and centred on the restored Quartz Cothon, held the potential to halt their landings or deter them from trying.""
 F29_zokka_long_moment_title:0 "The Long Moment"
 F29_zokka_long_moment_desc:0 ""There will come a moment before the conquest begins. Where my father will claim a new capital and announce the birth of his empire, all in the name of an apocalyptic dream. Perhaps, when he is dead, or full, or when nothing is left, he'll look at all he's taken and say: enough. But conquest has no natural end, and as long as I've known him, he's never been satisfied.\n\nTo grow is to eat. To eat is to grow stronger. And I think, at his core, my father is terrified of dying small.""

 F29_zokka_all_dim_all_pale_desc:0 ""The Kult spreads by faith and force. There's some beauty to be found in it. Disunited people, brought together by a felflame temptation.\n\nI think this is where I differ. They learn from what they're told. They believe what they're made to. To contrast, I pilfered books and scripture where my peers claimed flesh and gold. I taught myself to read them. I diversified. I left the Kult's echochamber before I ever truly crossed its threshold.\n\nDoes that make me better than them? Or is knowledge of different ways a curse I'm now stuck with? During my darker hours, I can't help but think: ignorance is bliss.""

 F29_zokka_dominance_title:0 "Dominance"
 F29_zokka_dominance_desc:0 ""The other packs fear us. Fear him. I've seen it in the tremble of their paws when they come to negotiate. They serve our interests for now, but I know the truth, and I suspect my father does too: fear will not keep them at bay forever, and they hold lands we're inclined to covet.\n\nInevitably, we'll need to find a place for them. And they'll bend, or they'll break.""
 F29_zokka_sunsetstone_title:0 "Sunsetstone"
 F29_zokka_sunsetstone_desc:0 ""Bulwar must be secured before we entertain any notion of taking the East or the South. It's the principle of the thing. The homeland of the First Sun's own cult cannot be suffered freedom; at least, in my father's opinion. That being said, early inroads have their benefits, especially with regards to Rahen. The mountains can only protect us for so long, should they decide us to be a threat to their prosperity.\n\nWe are, of course. We simply need to keep them pretending otherwise.""
 zokka_sunsetstone_fort_tt:0 "All owned provinces §Ywith forts bordering Rahen§! in the §YFar Salahad§! region have their forts §Gupgraded§!, and get '§YAvert Thine Eyes§!' until the end of the game, granting §G-50%§! Local Fort Maintenance Cost and §R-10%§! Local Defensiveness."
 F29_zokka_tension_knife_title:0 "Tension-Knife"
 F29_zokka_tension_knife_desc:0 ""I have spoken to the Surani of Hašr - the loyal ones, at least. I was surprised to find any at all, after the seizure and razing of their lands. But they exist, and they seek a future within the Pack, not outside of it.\n\nI am not a good Xhazobkultist. I am not a good gnoll. I believe them to be as misguided as their masters and mistresses. But their numbers continue to swell, as my father's empire grows. In a way, I admire their spirit. I wish I could mimic their drive for a better future.\n\nI wish I could love him as much as they do.""
 F29_zokka_demonology_title:0 "Demonology"
 F29_zokka_demonology_desc:0 ""A Xhazob does not speak the same way we do - this, the warlocks of Mazu Makhara were sure to impress. Listening to them is like watching a forest catch fire. Terrible, and sudden, and all-consuming, yet captivating in its brutality. A Xhazobkultist listens anyway.\n\nWhere a Xhazobkultist differs from a Xhazobain is in their capacity to answer: to learn their names, their secret titles, what brings them grief or glee. To speak to a Xhazob as if they are our equals. I wonder how true that is?\n\nRegardless, there is power in the language. Understanding a demon is the first step to mastering that power. The right turn of phrase could open a gate to a different place entirely.""
 F29_zokka_dominance_legacies_title:0 "Of Dominance And Legacies"
 F29_zokka_dominance_legacies_desc:0 ""A pack devoured doesn't die. Consumption is a type of magic all on its own. It isn't done for joy, or to satisfy tradition; a measure of strength is transferred from the devoured to the devourer, along with a drop of personality and creed. It is testament, then, to the strength of my father's dream - that it survives, unchanged and immutable, no matter how much he eats.""
 F29_zokka_legacies_xhaz_title:0 "Of Legacies And [Root.xhaz_gender_tt]s"
 F29_zokka_legacies_xhaz_desc:0 ""Even then, some will refuse the call. Far too many gnolls are prone to dramatics. They'll spit on our pyres and plant their feet in the dirt, but they'll give in once we establish a foothold - once we prove our Xhazob-given ability to lead. If not, we'll bring them lower than they thought possible.\n\nThere's tragedy in that. In a way, I see myself in them.""
 F29_zokka_xhaz_khets_title:0 "Of [Root.xhaz_gender_tt]s And Khets"
 F29_zokka_xhaz_khets_desc:0 ""Gods are held to rule the Sky. Demons are held to rule the Hells. Khet are held to rule the Sorrow. Such is the way of divinity. But mortality is a spectrum - and the Khet are the most mortal of the divine.\n\nThey aren't the First Sun... but we all start somewhere.""
 zokka_khet_dead_tt:0 "The §YKhet§! are §Rdead§!."

 F29_zokka_raise_high_pyres_title:0 "Raise High The Pyres"
 F29_zokka_raise_high_pyres_desc:0 ""There is a rite before every battle, and a rite after. We stand before the pyres, and kneel, and chant in unison. We press our foreheads to the ground and call upon the felflame beneath us.\n\nThis is a kind of magic, self-evidently. It's also another way we worship the Xhazobs. Most importantly, however, it is a message to those in our path - that they will be slaughtered or forced to join us, if they don't come willingly. And it's a very effective message, at that.""
 zokka_clear_refugees_tt:0 "The §YSurani Refugees§! will return to the §YSuran§!."
 zokka_pyres_mages_tt:0 "The §YKelmaxherho§! have at least §Y60§! loyalty, and §YNef Zokka§! has at least §Y30§! development, a §YTemple§! or §YCathedral§! building, a §YMarketplace§!, §YTrade Depot§!, or §YStock Exchange§! building, and no ongoing tasks in the province."

 F29_zokka_skim_mountains_title:0 "Skim The Mountains"
 F29_zokka_skim_mountains_desc:0 ""Not all kneel immediately. Not yet, at least. They keep to their temples and castles and mountaintops, hoarding their wealth and knowledge, refusing to make concessions. It's admirable, but ultimately nothing more than a small rebellion. Scratches in the dust.\n\nMy father tolerates them, to a point. Without difference, I think - without a foe, or a scapegoat - he sees no incentive to dominate. There is no drive to grow, and so there is no drive to eat. Taking control and enforcing his demands is just another way of feeding his power.""

 F29_zokka_pack_hegemony_title:0 "Pack Hegemony"
 F29_zokka_pack_hegemony_desc:0 ""Ours is the apotheosis. The pinnacle pack. No other can be greater, for this is the peak, and we keep building it higher. At some point, that hegemony must be solidified. Gnollkind will be united in the name of Zokka, and he acclaimed as the Once and Future Xhazobain. It's a far larger dream than I'm used to... yet, strangely, I think it can be fulfilled. If anyone can do it, it's him.""
 zokka_pack_hegemony_tt:0 "At least §Y30 provinces§!, or §Yevery province§!, claimed by the '§YOf [Root.xhaz_gender_tt]s And Khets§!' mission are directly owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§! - whichever comes first. These provinces must have less than §Y30§! local autonomy."
 zokka_gnoll_separatism_tt:0 "All owned provinces with a §Ygnollish population§! lose §G10§! years of separatism. Gnollish §Ymajority§! provinces lose §G20§!.\n\nWhenever a province with a §Ygnollish population§! is conquered by §Y[Root.GetName]§!, it loses §G10§! years of separatism. Gnollish §Ymajority§! provinces lose §G20§!."
 F29_zokka_twist_blade_title:0 "Twist The Blade"
 F29_zokka_twist_blade_desc:0 ""There are no lessons in moderation here. I'm not sure where I learned it. It certainly didn't come from my father; maybe my morals are just a form of rebellion.\n\nStill, I can't deny what excess brings. I have walked the streets of conquered cities - of Harrabad, of Hašr - and I've seen the ordered chaos left in our wake. A strength that grows from the ruins. I do not love the seizing, but I've come to accept it as a necessity.\n\nI think I have a place here. My father takes and razes, and I build on what he claims. Together, we leave behind something lasting.""

 F29_zokka_phoenix_banners_desc:0 ""Sarnagir is Bulwar's shield, and the soul of its nations. To burn it with profane fire, down to bone and beak, will break the cities and end their resistance to my father's empire. This is all logical, and I cannot fault him for it. That doesn't mean I have to like it.\n\nI have read the annals of her past flights. I have pictured her arcing across the sky, the Suran flowing beneath her, trailing flame like a comet.

He's spent days poring the histories of Xhazobines and Xhazobains past, carefully listing the mistakes each one made. Already, he seeks to remedy some, devising ever-greater rites with the help of his warlocks.\n\nBut fixing their errors is more than mere advancement. He wants revenge. He wants to prove himself the best of them all. He wants to claim Bulwar, just as the First as the Red. He wants the Sorrow and the lands either side, just as the Blighted and the Drowned and the Twin. And he wants the North, and the swamp - a scar, left in the wake of one of gnollkind's most salient blunders.""

Mine is that it can only be reached through total reform, into something kinder and more diverse than it's ever been previously. My father's is a vision of unity. All local Kults, collectivised into one, held together under the banner of a Xhazobine or Xhazobain. As long as those disparate Kults exist, that vision can never be realised.\n\nPersonally?

Blood still coats the muscle and sinew in a sticky, sickening glaze. The boy almost gags, but keeps his composure.\n\n"The future belongs to me. We all know it." The Pack Lord speaks, voice guttural. All chatter ceases, replaced by jeering and hollering. Zokka's own cheer is half-hearted, easily drowned out by the din. "But the First Sun still rises. My work is not done."

She sees it disappear into the hellfire, and its companion swiftly follows.\n\nAnd then, in an instant, the crackling of the fires ceases.\n\n"You call to me, supplicant."

Zokka's banner - grey, black, red, and hungry - rose above the ridge. The leader of their outpost tried to step forward, to speak, to question, and they slit his throat before he could say a word. No trial, no fight. Just the decree.\n\n"Loyalty," they said, "means exile." Loyalty to Tluukt, to Kogzalla, to Koggraffa. Names that no longer had any meaning. Those who weren't slain outright were rounded up. The younger pups were dragged off to be "retrained". Tsima's own brother had been one of them, vanishing down the slope without looking back, too young to know what he'd lost.\n\nShe is not.\n\nTsima grits her teeth. The halls ahead are musty, wet with old fear and dying things. Her [F55.Monarch.GetTitle] is already inside, refusing to show any fear, any trepidation at all. The elder in front of her clutches at his necklace, furiously muttering to himself.\n\n"This is a rebirth. This is a trial. We will emerge stronger."

The rest look to each other, until one clears his throat.\n\n"Are you... ready?" Tlezeen lifts her hand. A few moments pass.\n\n"Yes," she says, softly. Her voice is worn, and a little distant. "Sorry. I was listening."\n\nThey all exchange another look. Then, she stands, taking the time to walk between them like a priestess. Her claws are blunt, and oddly gentle, as she brushes them against their foreheads and ears.\n\nOnce, she dreamt, she told Ikram he was too quiet. She shattered a cart's axle and sent a shaman to her death. She told Acay he could be more than a weapon.\n\nIn truth, nobody actually remembers the moment Tlezeen was chosen to lead the Kaxhkeddax. They just woke up one day, and realised they were following her."

She kneels, brushing back a fan of fern fronds to examine the shoots curled beneath them.\n\n"New growth," she murmurs, absent-mindedly transcribing her ruminations in gnollish for the acolytes behind her. "Thinner. More delicate too - see here?" She lifts a sample, holding it up to the rays. "Practically straining itself for a little light."\n\nThe Kelmaxherho speak of the Masterwork in many different ways. For Sunita, it's a certainty, but... unlike many, she believes they could live, afterwards. She respects their conviction, but follows a slightly altered creed.\n\n"There's still time," she whispers, sealing the sample in a jar.\n\nThe world is vibrant - too vibrant to mourn. She records each species with obsessive care: the flowering pattern of ivy, the rhythms of ants cutting through the soil, the trembling chirps of the thrushes at dusk. She sketches every leaf, every wing, every petal, preserving them in notebooks she has copied and spread.\n\nThe end has not yet come. "Does it frighten you?" Her students ask, some disparaging, others simply curious. Sunita only smiles, faint and foxlike, turning a page.\n\n"Everything changes," she replies, "but, maybe, not everything needs to be lost.""

 flavour_zokka.60.d:0 "Pamphlets spread around Bulwar and the Divenhal like wildfire, the claims printed there more inflammatory than the hottest embers: Surakel, or some say, Surael, the last remaining god of the Bulwari Pantheon, is dead.\n\nPublished by the remnants of the Order of Judges, the printings detail the recent devouring of Sarnagir - the legendary Phoenix of Bulwar - by Zokka, alongside the failure of the forces of the Light to deter the encroaching [F29.GetName], and the massive loss of territories held by the various denominations of the Sun Cult. Town criers as far as the Empire of Anbennar shout the words from the rooftops: Surael is Dead.\n\nIn addition to the rapidly spreading pamphlets, a radical group of apprentice mages from the Kelmaxherho - scholar-slaves totally devoted to Zokka's cause - demonstrated a rare willingness to work alongside their technical owners, planning and carrying out what is likely to be the largest mass sacrifice ever held on Halann. Thousands of Sun Cult worshippers, imprisoned and enslaved for years after resisting conversion to the Xhazobkult, were tied to grand pyres constructed across Bulwar and lit in unison. The light of the hellfire was seen on the horizon as far away as Verne, and the pained, desperate screams of the now-deceased were allegedly heard from Tianlou to the tip of the Dragon Coast.\n\nThe shock and horror at the mass sacrifice - known to the masses as the Throes of Surael - has reverberated throughout Halcann, with many now struggling to feel safe in their homes. Others demand answers and guidance from their religious leaders, most of whom are just as shocked as their congregations. All the while, the question of the [F29.Monarch.GetTitle]'s true intentions remain murky - was it a bid for total religious unity? Or, more concerningly, a message for those that continue to resist the Xhazobkult's call: that they could be next?"

Uak shattered beneath her heel. At Burning Hill, dragonfire made ruin of her flesh - but not her will. The Flamemarked, they call her; they still call her.\n\nShe returned to Kheterata, with vengeance in her eyes and a soul boiling over. Elikhet gave his best, but she was better. The Sorrow bled that day, forced to kneel.\n\nWe recall the whips of felfire. We recall the armour of bone. We recall her pilgrimage to Mazu Makhara, where the warlocks taught her the words to flay the sky.\n\nEven after the Castanites broke her, and the White Flame claimed her body, her lieutenants endured, and the gnolls kept the faith.We are not her.

For a time, she marched, seeking silver. Instead, she found black, and was swallowed whole. No legacy was left to catch her.\n\nThe Third Xhaz fell.\n\nLast came Kuzzud, Herald-of-Pain. His voice stirred the downtrodden into a frenzy, but no Xhazobain is born of wrath alone. The Queendoms crushed his advance, and what remained marched north, where they were torn apart by the another's greatest mistake. Survivors slink through those cursed marshes still, scars carved in sick penance.\n\nThe Fourth Xhaz fell.\n\nWe see these failures as warnings, but their ashes serve as scripture.

Her sword hand gave way to sorcery, and her empire bloomed with its new infernal roots. The price of her ascension was paid in blood.\n\nNanaya became the Fifth.
