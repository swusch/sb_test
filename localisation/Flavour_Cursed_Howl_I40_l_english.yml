 cursed_howl_judgement_desc:0 "As part of our arrival into these woods we’ve sent out entire cadres of spies and patrols to see what we can learn of the terrain. We’ve learned that these woods are unpredictable, seemingly intent on making our life miserable as newcomers. We need to send out more patrols and feelers to the local Wood Elves to see what can be done. Failing this, we’ll need to take some more land for ourselves and ask them once under our rule."

 cursed_howl_nemesis_desc:0 "Against the odds we are continuing to triumph and doing so in a way that makes our cause proud. Instead of punitive measures that only deprive us of those with local expertise, we work actively to build bridges with our vassal populations. Their rulers pay homage to us and we protect them; but for as much as we shall maintain a kind of peace, we must prove we will back that promise with force. Those who will never accept our presence here must be brought to heel as many times as it takes."

Such resources must be claimed for ourselves, our dominance must be felt and so the grove must be made ours, especially against the other clans. Blightseed in particular must be ended: their corruptive touch befits their foul name, and their wanton cruelty makes them a fitting first target."

The struggle between us seems unlikely to abate, given our newcomer status and the battles we fought to establish ourselves here, but it doesn’t mean we need be savage. Many of them who are under our rule may still yearn for liberation, but it isn’t impossible to prove that at the very least we are the better option when it comes to orcish rulers. It should be possible to have local compromise and the beginnings of respect."

 cursed_howl_moonlit_tryst_desc:0 "Kavu, brother of Gordak, has long been in a complicated position. His inheritance is unlikely, given the main line ruling the clan, but has been content to serve the clan nonetheless. As our conquest of the Wood Elves continues, however, odd reports circulate regarding a relationship of his with an elf from the Hunter’s Grove. He has continued to serve the clan well – better even than before they met – but the rumours regarding the precise nature of their encounters have distracted many of those who follow his command, as they now have doubts about what their commander is up to. The truth must be revealed."

Gordak has instead set his own path and these would-be rivals must be ended. Honour demands that they must be stopped and as their fellows it must be done by our hand. Let us marshall all true orcs to put an end to those who only ravage, for the way must be lead by us."

These outcasts often have struggled, especially with the familial nature of relationships in the Sallas and those we now have command over. Their expertise could prove useful, however, and with our commitment to being fair even in conquest we stand a good chance of winning them over, at least; after all, compared with other orcish clans, those elves who bow to us are spared the wholesale destruction of their people."

We have secured our position, rooted out the leaders who might have fallen prey to such depredations, but it seems there is more to do. For this rot to be removed, expunged from our new home, we must lay waste to the current. We shall make of our tolerance and unity a challenge to this force, to taunt them into the open by the simple bait of kindness in the face of such malignance, that they may hide no longer.

By hook or by crook we shall make use of their talents and see about restoring the kinds of relationships we once maintained elsewhere. Our fellow orcs are cruel, but there are ways we can follow the same path while respecting limited autonomy, in return for certain expectations of service.

Orcs whose strength comes in all things: first within the Dwarovar and now with our following of Korgus to Escann and beyond, each time adapting to our surroundings. These woods are far from what we once knew, and for those who remember the caverns still, much effort still remains to prove that a new life is possible. For the orcish people to have a future, we must prove ourselves able to adapt.

The Deepwoods will be Orcish-led from here on, but it shall not be Orcish-exclusive; after all, we have much to learn from these other denizens if we wish to keep ourselves strong and make sure our place is not overtaken from our own inflexibility. There is a bounty in these woods if we but show the wisdom to take it, and those outside will surely not have been idle. Future generations will know our invasion as the very last, as all the people of the Deepwoods step forwards under our rule."

 cursed_howl_oubligs_lesson_desc:0 "Oublig was a goblin who was pivotal in taking down an archfey, the Eldest, when Corin and her Circle came to these lands. Though their faith is not ours, their contributions are still pivotal and worth learning from. Oublig’s lesson is opportunity and warning: what comes when divinity intercedes and how the intervention of pernicious fey can create such disharmony if not properly prepared for. The fey cannot be stamped out entirely, not now or ever, but their influence needs to be worked with and controlled for, to the extent that such a thing is ever possible. For just as with the goblins and elves, we inhabit this land alongside them."

We orcs came into this new environment, chasing those who had fought us before and we learnt of all that was different here. Much the same is said to be what happened to the elves in their struggle against an ancient empire in Escann. So it is that under our stewardship this cycle repeated; just as before, struggles broke out, and a new order and a new kind of peace was eventually found. It shall surely take the elves and goblins time to adjust, but both peoples have done so at least once before. With our eyes upon the future we shall blaze a trail for them to follow… when they are ready."

He is still a prisoner but even as hated as he is, he is still treated as the leader of a clan. Orcs followed him for a reason and that much is to be respected even when nothing else about him deserves such grace. The assembly of the elders is called and the honourless curr is brought forth to be judged. His muscles atrophied of his own volition by refusing to eat our food, he remains in chains – for a warrior’s death would little become him if he were to attempt to attack those present \n\nThe outcome is not in doubt and neither are his crimes. Yet Bosk refuses to recognise the principles of the judgement, objecting every moment he can to the proceedings, and in the end there is only the finality to be realised with his execution. Gordak grasps his claymore and makes easy the last moments. It is more than Bosk deserves and yet he retains some dignity in refusing to beg even at this final hour.\n\n“I see there is some true orc left in that head somewhere, buried under all that rot.” The blade is raised, and then falls."

Kavu was always on edge during these patrols, led in the name of his brother – the clan chief – to check nothing had passed through recently conquered lands. Kavu had always been the quietest of his brothers, one of the first to adjust to the surface, and that had landed him the role of chief scout. His brother had looked out for him, ever since Bolk had adopted them into his family as heirs, but Kavu’s independent streak had meant he was never going to really follow Gordak’s footsteps.\n\nHe was the perennial voice of reason on Gordak’s shoulder, the one who inspired Gordak to see what could be when the time came to stop – the one who’d looked after them since the fall of Khugdihr. And he was the one who kept them alive amidst the chaos of the campaign. But Gordak was doing well and Kavu was proud of what was going on with the clan. The fighting was far from over when it came to relations with the wood elves, but they were no longer scrabbling for survival.\n\nThese thoughts weighed on him somewhat as he passed through the foliage, only turning at the last moment as he realised the footsteps he was hearing weren’t entirely in sync with his feet.\n\nSlowly turning around, he saw her. A female elf with the longest hair he’d ever seen and piercing eyes that dragged his stare directly to match hers. She looked at him and seemed to be taking him in, a mirror of himself. Her bow was raised, his hand lay on a throwing axe.\n\nNeither moved, the stillness and silence of the forest engulfing them both. In this strange moment of connection, he wanted to call out, to ask her name. To learn something of this face he wouldn’t forget anytime soon. But instead she just smirked; made for the trees. Eventually, painfully, slowly, Kavu jogged to catch up with the men who’d went on ahead."

We find ourselves attacked time and again, but this is different than revelling in the suffering that conflict brings. We wish ourselves a home and we’ll make it here, by force if the Wood Elves continue to reject that reality. But orcs are not satyrs come to massacre – our lives do not exist for the purpose of craving violence as Satyrs’ do.”\n\nThe chieftain rang out, his words a meditation as he thundered to the audience that gathered in the wake of Cursed Howl’s great victory. Two angry figures stood in the arena, gathered for their final duel.\n\n“You entered this contest for the Orcish soul under the childish delusion that you were going to kill and pillage everyone in your wake – that no one would be strong enough to object. At Ciranmyna, the Flower Grove, and dozens of other places besides, you showed your ugliness and naivete to us all. The wind was sown, and it's time the Reaper has his due.”\n\nGordak dropped into the arena, brandishing the masterwork blade he had inherited from his father. The same blade he’d use to slay Bolk when he’d led the Cursed Howl too far astray. He charged them both, eager to finish their legacy personally."

 flavour_cursed_howl.6.d:0 "As the scout’s position on the flank suddenly became less of a flank and more of an encirclement, he couldn’t help but wonder why this had to happen now. At the very least the Cursed Howl’s new conduct had allowed for prisoners on either side. Perhaps there’d be a chance there to avoid being cut down now, and instead look for escape later as the situation changed.\n\nKavu and his men laid their arms down for the moment. He could just about make out from the bits of the Elven tongue he’d picked up that they were deciding if it wasn’t just easier to kill them now, and hope they didn’t know anyone potentially captive on the Orcish side. Kavu signed this to the others and then saw something that struck him. Her, again. She looked over and clearly saw him too, starting slightly. She spoke to her comrades - they were getting agitated and speaking so fast now that he couldn’t really understand. Eventually she alone came over to speak.\n\n“This tongue, you understand me?” she asked, but it wasn’t a question - she seemed to guess he’d understand Goblin.\n\n“Yes. Enough, anyway. I got on well with the shortstacks.” it wasn’t a lie, even if Bolk had asked him to learn Goblin merely as a way of managing ‘servants’.\n\n“Good, I’d like to speak with you..”\n“Me too…”\n\nHis words half-interrupted hers, a little too eager.The words simply slipped out. He wasn’t even sure with what tone but he almost wanted to blush, and on a battlefield no less!\n\n“Fey give me strength, men are men I suppose-” she said, though a smile had crept in that belied her tone. The strange moment of connection lingered, interrupted only by the sound of warhorns, the timbre indicating Gordak’s personal guard.\n\n“That would be … my brother. He’s .. uh … always looking out for me.” Kavu said, hoping to keep this woman from having the entire scout detachment killed to avoid the complication.\n\n“Well he can worry no longer … and perhaps owe Arya Whistlebreeze, should this situation ever be reversed.” She seemed confused herself by how sideways this interrogation had gone; she broke off entirely, whistled for a mount and the elves rode off."

Kavu looked up from the dwelling he’d made in the canopy, here in the Flower Grove they’d made home. A small place, just for him with his bed and a few shelves for his ranging gear, strewn between branches with rope and designs that made sure the weight distribution kept stable.\n\nHe looked up at the night sky and the freedom it indicated. They’d never expected any of this: what Escann had been like, so green and vast, and now what the Deepwoods were like, the astonishing profusion of varied life.\n\nKavu himself had a long and varied life ahead of him, and yet he couldn’t help but remember that woman. Arya. Unlike the others she had seemed to view him as a person–an enemy, to be sure, but not just a monster to be killed without mercy. The reports of others in brief captivity described elves for whom the idea of bothering to ransom back orcs was seen almost as a cruel joke or a brief humouring of monsters.\n\n“How thankful I must be,” he said aloud to the stars. “But why then must I feel these pangs…”\n\nWas it guilt, or something else? His feelings were strange, something like that which Gordak said people felt for those they … loved?"

It had been one of the most painful decisions she’d ever taken, to leave the place where it often felt like her heart still lay – the Flower Grove. And yet now it sometimes felt like it beat again, but instead as a guilty cancer at the crux of herself. In her dreams she walked the rows of the departed and the grave markers, their ghosts reaching out. She was haunted in dreams and waking moments both.\n\nHer hands drifted over the brooch that she kept safe, and she did her little exercise, straining to remember, detail by detail, exactly what her husband looked like. But he just reminded her of that orc. It was odd when she first saw him that night, but the way he held himself and walked, the way that he’d moved – it was as though her first love had returned in new form. She didn’t know how long orcs lived for, but as absurd as the idea was, that orc would have been 30 if she had to guess – much too close for comfort.\n\nThe stories of how the elves had come to these woods and become the Wood Elves often glossed over any violence that would have occurred between them and the forest goblins; instead, young elves learned only of the current, relative detente. Were there those, even at the outset, who desired peace, shaped by their own earlier loss?"

The ground of the clearing was stained red; the blood flowed into a sort of pool that threatened to become a lake. Or so it seemed, swimming in his exhausted vision as he came to rest by one of the few untouched trees. Its unblemished nature was mere chance, of course, but it still proved a symbol of his own unlikely survival.\n\nAs he sat down, he felt the tiredness catch up; the energy leached from his body, and he imagined it feeding the grass, feeding his unblemished tree. Why had this come at such a time, and why did it feel like such a pyrrhic victory? Suddenly, a sound caught his ears, that of another person’s breath. It was just around the trunk of his very tree, and he crawled over to see if it was friend or foe.\n\n“Hello.” said a familiar elf – he found himself a bit lost for words. “I don’t think you ever told me your name?”\n\nIt was such a silly question, especially at a time like this, but he felt compelled to answer Arya. “Kavu. Hello … I’ve been thinking of you, can’t quite forget you for some reason.”\n\nShe laughed, coughed in pain. “Two for two then. You remind me of someone I used to know. It feels like our paths endeavour to cross time and again. I have wondered if a force is at work.”\n\n“Fey give you strength?” Kavu did his best to grin.\n\nArya was about to open her mouth when Kavu, acting equally on instinct, clambered forward and closed it with a kiss; his lips bumped against hers, she almost jerked back. Then, after a moment’s hesitation, she took an arm and brought him in closer, pushing at his back.\n\nPerhaps some force was toying with them both, but in that moment – after such grotesquery on the battlefield – there was a time for simple pleasures. A time for selfishness, a time for the simple company of another’s embrace even as they might battle again come the morn."

She smiled at him like she’d expected to see him again, as if this was inevitable. By her side tottered a child who was quite unlike the other elves, too green by half.\n\n“Is he … ?” he asked, not even bothering with preamble.\n\n“Yes.” came her answer, and he felt his legs get weak. So much of his world and existence seemed to change in a moment, for something so real to come of a night that had felt more a dream every year since.\n\nBut reality interrupted such idle thoughts, “We’re leaving tomorrow and troubling your authority no longer,” she said, her voice almost cracking.\n\n“And the tyke?” he asked, unsure what answer he wanted. “Tavdan only knows his mother. We were something, but the stars are not aligned to give us any more time than we had that night. Our places require us to be apart.” Arya was so certain. So right.\n\n“I wish that we had time.” he said.\n\n“We shall be back tomorrow,” he added, hastily, “and I hope -” he wasn’t sure how the sentence ended. That she’d be there with his child? That she’d away and potentially be safe outside the woods?\n\nHis mind was troubled; he slept poorly. The next morning, without bothering to explain, he sent his men off elsewhere and returned to the clearing. In such a state as he was, it was no small wonder that Kavu didn’t bump directly into Arya. She was with Tavdan; the boy was holding her hand tight, trying to be brave.\n\n“But…” he stammered\n\n“But what? Mayhaps I lied, or changed my mind,” Arya said, squeezing their son's hand. Her face was almost blank, almost brisk. “To tell the truth, he asked about you last night. I may never quite make my peace with the new reality here. But he... and also I... deserve a family come whatever may. And so I humbly request your protection.” There was something wry in her expression, as if a test.\n\n“I suppose I shall have to make sure you are treated well then, as mother of a potential future chief.” He embraced them both, filled with the strength to lift them both into the air in this moment."

Long have some suspected their influence among aspects of our invasion and yet the way their favour has primarily been felt by the Elves and Goblins had left many to question if something else might be at play. After all, these woods are home to much that is queer: something even older than the fey seems less and less likely now, but the idea once had credence among the tellers of ancient tales.\n\nPatrols are kept still though, and for those we’ve put in place of managing the local communities we keep strict account. There doesn’t seem to be more than the usual resistance across the provinces we’ve taken but a pervasive unease has settled all the same.\n\nIndeed, things are somehow worse even when more patrols remain unmolested, their workings proceeding far apace of usual schedules.

 flavour_cursed_howl.13.d:0 "It started suddenly, the capital ablaze. Some day, perhaps the orcs would laugh to know they too had now known a day of ashen skies. Each speck of ash proved hostile and malign, burning those upon whom it fell and soon the cacophony of the injured and casualties was all that could be heard across the encampment.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetName] rushed to the scene, beholding at the market heart a strange figure, seemingly born out of a pile of ashes, reforming themself into a greyscale figure awash with authority, boasting a gaze that made even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] tremble. The figure’s gaze was bewitching, somehow, keeping the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s eyes affixed to their terrible and intoxicating presence.\n\nThey didn’t even speak, but somehow, in a fascination of the fey, words could be felt in [Root.Monarch.GetName] head as they knelt in an awestruck manner for the time. Their movements in this ashen form formed words, somehow, directly in [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s head, issuing a voice the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had never heard before.\n\n“I am they, the Blackened Prince and it was by mine will that your clan has prospered. Mine influence in those you call the Silentblade set you upon thine current path. Your prosperity, ‘tis owed to me. And for that I bid you to serve me. For I am the true justice and I require utter obedience in turn. I shall ask only this once.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] felt their own control returning to them, the more they stared at the strange, ashen form. It was clear that whatever power was felt here was waning. The ash fell no more and they were able to stand up, proud in their response. Whatever truth and whatever power this Blackened Prince had, there was only one answer to this call for obeisance."

 flavour_cursed_howl.14.d:0 "It is upon us, the War of Black Trees. The Blackened Prince corrupts many an orc into these emerald servitors and they assault us across the woods. But we are lucky we are not truly alone, for our subjects see this desperate struggle and this time, we all stand together. If we had been cruel or insolent in our victory, then perhaps this would be the time to break free, for dreams of a Goblin or Elven resurgence to spark and rise as a new rebellion. But we have brought a kind of peace and in the main this is respected.\n\nThey may still have issues with how history’s pages have turned, but we have given them a place of their own and they trust they’ll have a place in whatever comes out of this terrible war between brothers. Once there was a grand conclave between the elves at Elynaile, which the human goddess Corin and the goblin Oublig attended unbidden. They united to stop our invasion and the rampage of the other crueler warlords.\n\nToday we hold a new council. Amidst the scaffolding of the still-rebuilding Flower Grove we hold the Council of Gordak, in the name of the one whose sense of justice liberated all the orcs of the Deepwoods from cruelty and abyssal moral degradation. That corruption had been metaphorical, but today the Prince’s influence is literal. They seek to chain us and make us their weapon against the other fey. There is no love lost, to be sure, between us and the fey – but a tool we will not be.\n\nAt this new council it is time for all to unite and answer the call as change sweeps the Deepwoods. Our subjects shall join us in full, no longer mere vassals, for united we all stand against this menace. This epitome of old enmities shall be ended by a new union of orc, goblin and elf!"

 flavour_cursed_howl.15.d:0 "The rule of the Cursed Howl chieftains has a long legacy. It is a legacy of choices; to be just, to seize the mantle of leadership when injustice demands to be confronted. Under our reign, there are rules to be followed, a reprieve from the arbitrariness that comes with those who forsake natural laws, the intrinsic feeling that makes us all sapient.\n\nThose divides may not be healed this generation, or even in the one after. But our new royalty with its half-orc nature represents a hope for a future across different boundaries. In the past, some have pressed for a different government, by elders selected to rule in rotation. Others for a rule by shamans with the new place of religion in our culture.\n\nInstead, it seems a monarchy we are to remain, one in which there is a place for the other denizens of the Deepwoods, even as they serve. The trees may burn, the branches may break, but they shall fall together and be bound up into kindling for our nation's flame. We shall not be a pyre for the ambitions of those who would toy with us, but instead shall burn brightly to our own ends, casting aside these wretches who would keep all the Deepwoods ensorcelled and immutable."

 flavour_cursed_howl.16.d:0 "Across our lands there has been a slow increase in marriages and other unions between orc and elf, and more to the point there have been many children from these unions who have begun to take prominent places in society, in a way that simply wasn’t possible with the rare children of elf-goblin unions in the voltoj. These half-elves, half-orcs seem akin to the reports we hear of half-orcs in Escann, and so for now we shall know them as such. While this belies their elven inheritance, it does show that our country sees our orcish roots as the strongest.\n\nLife isn’t always easy for these new children, often the products of some unions less pleasant and yet still kept and raised, in no less loving situations than their full-blooded brethren. Whatever their origin, there is much adaptation to be done and a long road ahead as we all adjust to a permanent future with better relations between the people of the woods. The destruction that they inherit shall hopefully be the last great conflagration in its history."
