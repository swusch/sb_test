No life of peace can thereupon be enjoyed but for the release of her power altogether, and sometimes even then.\nYet every moment burdened by power is also with power infused, and by each gesture the Mayor makes her will known: the letter sent, the brush of an arm, the favour for a cousin. Thus the wise Mayor's rule is a thousand inconsequences, assembled with ceaseless patience into a slender blade.”\nLadana Anchialairé, “The Mayor”"

 LRM_reassess_the_damage_desc:0 "We cities of the Luna have learned to our cost the price of solitude. Each pulled in our own direction by the Fourth Lilac War, we have seen great destruction in a conflict which benefited us not a whit. Regardless of which side we were pulled onto, regardless of neutrality, troops marched and pillaged through the river valley. They paid scant heed for our sovereignty or independent history, often torching the territory of cities that were technically on their side.\n\nWhat do we learn from this? First, that we can never again allow ourselves to be the pawn of distant imperial power games - we must instead win them. Second, that our destiny lies with ourselves, and the rich culture of the Luna watershed."

 LRM_the_art_of_company_title:0 "The Art of Company"
 LRM_the_art_of_company_desc:0 "“Fools and tyrants constrict their guest lists too tightly, but we know better than this. One seats the vulgar, swashbuckling Vernman mercenary captain by Lady Chelma, for she is unjudgemental and will make him feel immediately at home; in turn the captain softens Lord Memmen, whose natural shyness may be circumvented only by giving him something gorgeous to look at. Memmen, once thawed, is a picture of etiquette who earns you the priests. Thus a coarse sort of man is the grist in the oyster.\n\nConsider too: now you have a reputation in both directions. You are the one willing to legitimise the lower ranks, and suddenly the bold and talented of little birth reveal themselves to you. At the same time, an unimpeachable nobleman in need of certain contacts attends your gatherings; he slips a message to the mercenary captain, only to go home and deride your choice of company. One does not hold a grudge, of course - the nobleman is merely saving face.”\n\n- Tomás of Vallusna, Private Correspondence"

Our natural system of regimentation, in which each city outfits and supplies its own force capable of independent operation or coordination, has proven itself intuitively suited for the disciplined practice of blackpowder warfare.\n\nThe highly professional guild-musketmen we once called City Guards are these days more often referred to simply as the Guards: an iron fist within a velvet glove, serving all of Pashainé."

Even travel in the Luna Valley is best done by barge, and the Guardsmen of Luna cities fight as skilled infantrymen, not on horseback. Thus where others see uncertainty in this new age of cannon and rifle, we see only opportunity.\n\nWhat fear does the Guardsman have, when the artillery corps at his back has already blown apart the cavalry charge from the fixed buttress of a Luna fortress? When he and his mates may pick off the fop's courser in a single volley? Those who have so long trampled over the Luna Valley will soon dread the sickening crunch of the bayonet and the lingering whiff of blackpowder."

 LRM_starve_the_vultures_desc:0 "Across the long churn of imperial history, the cities of the Luna have suffered greatly indeed. In moments of weakness, market town after market town has been ripped from the watershed by one of many circling powers. These scavengers have little regard for our traditional local legislatures, imposing erratic taxes and excise duties to sate the appetites of their distant sovereigns. They are not popular.\n\nIt is time we struck on multiple fronts. Our friends among the merchants will whisper the slogan to any who might repeat it - protect the Luna, starve the vultures. We will offer relief funds to guilds that join our boycott against these outsiders, patronise promising artists who will rail against the current state of affairs. Soon, all the Empire will know the people of the Luna hate their occupiers. Then we will go to the Diet, calling in every favour we have won through our influence. When we arrive, it will be upon a wave of public feeling, incontestable in our righteousness."

Instead the sacrifice we give her will make this place secure and strong. There will come a time soon when the Queen of Rivers flows tranquil and easy, her waters only gently stirred by the dipping of oars.

The closest thing we have to a military, our City Guard, has never been a force of press-ganged, pockmarked peasants, but instead a guild of Guardsmen akin to any other corporate association. This need not be a hindrance, however. The tough lesson of the Fourth Lilac War is the absolute requirement of a loyal, local force which can go on the offense, that we might never be caught out again.

If we seek to reinforce one another's sovereignty and fend off bigger imperial states for longer than a couple of decades, we will need to find ways of formally resolving our disputes and building consensus for mutual action.

Trapped between Verne, Cestirande, Istralore, Wex and Moonhaven, they have been turned against one another, pawns in a larger political game. Yet in the last few decades their confidence has grown immensely, and a distinct political identity, bourgeois and ambitious, has begun to dominate all of these sibling-cities. The cities of the Luna have mastered the art of Imperial influence, using the offices and institutions of the Empire to protect themselves from more powerful member states. Now they seek to permanently assert their sovereignty via writ.\n\nThough the petitioner hails from [From.GetName], her co-signatories consist of representatives of all of the members of the Luna Confederation, and she makes clear they stand as one. She points to the Luna's history as a rich and integral part of Old Dameria, and argues for the existence of a distinct hybrid identity along that storied river, as vibrant as that of Esmaria - the Pashainéy culture.\n\nPointing to the endless division and subdivision which foreign intervention has caused along the Luna, the delegate argues that it is high time for the Pashainéy to possess their own representative electorship, one which will protect the interests of the Free Cities of the river and ensure that an Emperor must vie for their support."

 flavour_LRM.21.d:0 "The Luna embraces difficult compromise, accepting in return a buildup of strange and sometimes dysfunctional arrangements between its many cities. The bridge between Bellacaire and Bluehart, for example, serves as both border and customs toll, routinely causing massive confusion as crowds deadlock, queueing in both directions for toll stations on either side of the bridge. The organisation of these queues being less than stellar, this tends to make order of precedence impossible to determine and renders the bridge completely useless for other travellers. It is clear that a less ad hoc solution needs to be worked out for the situation, but both Bellacaire and Bluehart claim primary jurisdiction. The absurd part of it is, a decision here will only determine on which side of the bridge travellers must queue, but the cities are ever-sensitive to potential wounds against their dignity.\n\nA third option, the chancellery suggests, would be to create a small guild to manage the bridge traffic. It would enforce customs laws of both sides and take a small cut of the proceeds; it could also serve as a model for future cross-Confederation projects. Both cities could be readily convinced to have the problem taken off their plates in such a way, but we'd need to pull some strings."

The masters and journeyman of a given city are prone to consider themselves a single unit, and they compete with the guilds of other cities like peasants in a blood feud. It is rare for this to spill over into actual criminality, but this time the stakes were imperial approval.\n\nA commission bound for the family of the Emperor from a haberdasher's guild in Thanallen was recently intercepted by the Elensbridge Tailor's Guild, who apparently pay informants in the Imperial postal service to open the post of rival guilds. They destroyed the order and submitted their own, claiming in an accompanying letter that the Thanallen Guild had been unable to fulfill the order.\n\nThis leaves us in a sticky situation. As of yet there is no overarching law in the Confederation that would police this kind of competition, beyond the minor fines the Elensbridge Guild has already gladly paid. But to allow this kind of manoeuvring to go basically unaddressed undermines the Confederation's unity, especially economically. Even if we find in favour of Thanallen, they can never regain such a rare opportunity to impress the Imperial House."

No wonder, then, that these lovely glades should prove so tempting to local peasantry, who have always somewhat blithely ignored the municipal borders between Eastbright and Byshade.\n\nThat such a sweet place should now be so tainted is a shame. An Eastbrighter orchard-keeper, furious at coming across trees stripped of their fruit year by year, applied a poison to the trees closest to his property boundary - itself almost exactly the border between Eastbright and Byshade. It was enough to give the Byshader interlopers a few days of discomfort and make a point… except for a small child, for whom the dose proved lethal.\n\nThe case is already thorny.

Charging as they do into the most dangerous situations, they resolve those issues which fall beyond the means of local communities. But the folk who run into danger generally have a reason not to be faithfully tending fields, and they are often rowdy. The parties of Menibór's famous Loop can reach immense sizes, spawning destructive bands of inebriated warriors.\n\nIn this most recent case, a group of Vernmen were pleased enough with themselves for having dispatched a band of gnolls that they rampaged along the Pirluna towards Napesbay, wrecking several vineyards and causing significant property damage. Menibór has disclaimed all responsibility for a group that were, after all, private citizens, but Napesbay finds this utterly specious.

It is generally accepted that one must build up a web of references doing donkey work until one can really make one's fortune as an adventurer, but even the new and hungry sometimes reach their limit. The Loop is bristling with the story of one such young, imaginative figure who set up ingenious traps throughout the Elensbridge drain network and cleared out over two hundred of the greatrats who had made their home there.\n\nElensbridge responded by taking one of the traps to reverse-engineer and arguing that the traps, not the adventurer, had killed the rats - they owed him nothing.
