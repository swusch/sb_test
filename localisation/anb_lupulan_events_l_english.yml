#Events
 lupulan_events.1000.t: "King Of The Jungle"
 lupulan_events.1000.d.1: "Since the jungle was a collection of seedlings, we of the Lupulan have made it our home. We attempt to live in balance with all things, from the other tribes of the jungle to the great spirits which guide us in so many ways. The overseer of all balance and everything is the Sri Baginda, King of Kings. It is the Sri Baginda’s job to create order from the bickering tribes and the fickle spirits, to ensure that our way of life in the Lupulan may continue. This is the way it should be, anyway.\n\nNot all is well in the jungle. The Lupulan is under threat from the pirates of Pinghoi, who treat the Sri Baginda’s rule as an obstacle and the spirits as menaces. The Sri Baginda of Jaya Raya stands defeated, and their orders fall on deaf ears while their calls for tribute go unanswered. What good is a king with no subjects?"
 lupulan_events.1000.d.2: "The tribes of the Lupulan are notoriously reclusive. We know very little of them: only that they worship the spirits of the jungle and that their tribes are united in a loose confederation under a chief they call the “Sri Baginda”, whom they believe holds legitimate rule over all the Lupulan.\n\nUnfortunately for them, their Sri Baginda is being squeezed from all sides. Sedition from within and invading armies from the outside world have made the Sri Baginda into a king without a kingdom. Their disarray provides us with a great opportunity: let us bring civilization to them quickly before they manage to regroup."
 lupulan_events.1000.a: "We enter uncertain times..."
 lupulan_events.1000.b: "All the Lupulan will be ours!"
 lupulan_events.1001.t: "Invader From Beyond"
 lupulan_events.1001.d: "[sri_baginda_attacker.GetName] has declared war on [sri_baginda_help.GetName]. They have sent an envoy to our palace to remind us of our obligation as Sri Baginda to defend them against outside invaders, and have requested that we deploy our troops to the line of battle as soon as possible."
 lupulan_events.1001.a: "We march to war!"
 lupulan_events.1001.b: "Perhaps it is time we gave up the crown."
 lupulan_events.1002.t: "The Jungle Chief"
 lupulan_events.1002.d: "Our campaign to subjugate the Lupulan has encountered a new obstacle. The tribe we seek to conquer appears to be subject of some backwards kind of Jungle Chief, and their armies march to battle to repel our attack on their subject."
 lupulan_events.1002.a: "How pitiful."
 lupulan_events.1002.b: "Who even let their messenger in here?"
 lupulan_events.1003.t: "Death Of A Fallen"
 lupulan_events.1003.d: "Upon the death of a Sri Baginda, the rulers of the Lupulan convene to elect a new Sri Baginda. Usually, this process is a formality, as the heir of the Sri Baginda serves as the obvious choice.\n\nHowever, the recent actions of our state have led to a degradation of our status in the eyes of the rest of the world, to the degree that the selection of our new ruler as Sri Baginda would be seen as a declaration of weakness and an invitation to outsiders to interfere in the Lupulan. For this reason, the others have chosen a new candidate as Sri Baginda."
 lupulan_events.1003.a: "We will claim it back..."
 lupulan_events.1004.t: "The Humiliation of [Root.GetName]"
 lupulan_events.1004.d: "The loss in our recent war against [From.GetName] appears to have been the last event in a rule increasingly marked by weakness and disarray. They have staged a grand parade in their capital, and their [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has given a grand speech in which they have declared our weakness and their new rule as Sri Baginda, King of Kings. Already, the envoys of the others flock to give tribute."
 lupulan_events.1004.a: "Those fools will discover the trials of rulership soon enough"
 lupulan_events.1005.t: "Dissolution Of The Sri Baginda"
 lupulan_events.1005.d: "The Lupulan is alive, but it is not unchanging. Where once the title of Sri Baginda held sway or at least respect from all kings of the Lupulan, the title is nowadays defined by absence: absence of power, absence of influence, and absence of relevance. The crown lies in the gutter, but no one can be bothered to pick it up."
 lupulan_events.1005.a: "We move forward, willingly or not"
 lupulan_events.1006.t: "Facts of Life"
 lupulan_events.1006.d: "The one thing that can be said to be a constant of life in the Lupulan is the drone of the jungle. It acts as a constant backdrop to the rhythms of the Lupulan, and we could not imagine life without it.\n\nIn the same way, our rule has become a part of the Lupulan. The vassals pay tribute, all the Lupulan bends the knee, and we are a part of the jungle as much as the noise. We have repelled the pirates, the tribes of the plains, and the zealots of High Philosophy. Their populations do not resist, for the Lupulan itself is on our side. We are a fact of life."
 lupulan_events.1006.a: "We have built an empire to stand the test of time"
 lupulan_events.1007.t: "Fruits Of Our Labor"
 lupulan_events.1007.d: "Life in the Lupulan is full of festivals and celebrations, but few of these festivals are as satisfying as the presentation of the grand tribute.\n\nWatching our subjects’ emissaries select every word with the utmost care and compete to bow the deepest, it is impossible not to notice the difference good leadership makes. In older days, the presentation of grand tribute to the Sri Baginda was a duty given to the most junior and useless courtiers, and the tribute itself was assembled haphazardly and often embezzled from. Now the kings of the Lupulan send their most resplendent diplomats to bestow upon us wonders: they desire not only our grand protection, but to be a part of our glory, however small.\n\nOur predecessors as Sri Baginda were incompetents, fools who dirtied their crown as they rolled about in mud. It has not been easy to restore the title of Sri Baginda, but it is moments like these that make our effort worth it"
 lupulan_events.1007.a: "It's good to be king"
 lupulan_events.1008.t: "King of Kings"
 lupulan_events.1008.d: "The title of Sri Baginda is a promise as much as it is an epithet. It is a promise to our vassals that our rule will be wise and just, to the spirits that our kingship is righteously guided, and to our people that the Lupulan will be theirs forevermore. The Sri Bagindas of old made a mockery of this promise, but through generations of kingship and glory we have proclaimed to the world that we intend to honor our duties. This is why all the Lupulan bends the knee.\n\nOur vassals come readily to us to resolve their disputes, convinced that our decision will be fair. The Lupulan and its spirits watch over our rule, convinced that we honor the balance of human and spirit. Our people live ordered and prosperous lives, convinced that our rule is legitimate. All is as it should be and as it will be forever, so long as we keep our promise."
 lupulan_events.1008.a: "Glory to the Sri Baginda, King of Kings!"
 lupulan_events.1009.t: "A New Lord"
 lupulan_events.1009.d.1: "We did not expect much from the death of the old Sri Baginda. The way it has always been is that the heir of the Sri Baginda is chosen to carry on their legacy. This time, however, there were whispers. The other tribes whispered to us that the palace of the Sri Baginda had fallen into disarray. They whispered to us of decadence and weakness.\n\nWhen the time for the election came, those whispers became votes for our rule cast in plain speech. We have been tasked with kingship over all of the Lupulan as Sri Baginda, King of Kings."
 lupulan_events.1009.d.2: "Upon the death of a Sri Baginda, the tribes of the Lupulan convene to choose their successor. The way it has always been is that the heir of the Sri Baginda is chosen to carry on their legacy, but this time was different.\n\nAfter talking to the other tribes, we reached a consensus that a change was needed, and we banded together with the other tribes to elect another to the office. Over the screams of the Sri Baginda’s idiot children, we have crowned a new successor. "
 lupulan_events.1009.a: "Glorious will our reign be!"
 lupulan_events.1009.b: "May their reign be better than the last"
 lupulan_events.1010.t: "The Cycle Turns"
 lupulan_events.1010.d.1: "As our troops march in victory formation past cheering throngs, there is a sense of change in the air. All have known for years that the Sri Baginda was old and weak, but it is only we who had the courage to do something about it. We shall invite all the Lupulan to our grand capital, and there we shall inform them all that there is a new Sri Baginda."
 lupulan_events.1010.d.2: "The clash of battle has gone silent, and counted among the dead is the reign of the old Sri Baginda. For years their weakness has been a source of quiet discussion, but it is only now that their reign has been challenged. The armies of the Sri Baginda have been defeated in battle, and so a new Sri Baginda rises."
 lupulan_events.1010.a: "Glorious will our reign be!"
 lupulan_events.1010.b: "May their reign be better than the last"
 lupulan_events.1011.d: "[sri_baginda_attacker_2.GetName] has declared war on [sri_baginda_help_2.GetName]. They have sent an envoy to our palace to remind us of our obligation as Sri Baginda to defend them against outside invaders, and have requested that we deploy our troops to the line of battle as soon as possible."
 lupulan_events.1012.t: "Can We Get Much Higher?"
 lupulan_events.1012.d: "A subject is ready to be elevated (Placeholder)"
 lupulan_events.1012.a: "[sri_baginda_tributary_1.GetName]"

#Lupulan Flavor Events
 lupulan_events.2000.t: "The Grandest Temple"
 lupulan_events.2000.d: "Petitioners have recently come before the court to request that we build a grand temple to honor the more benevolent spirits of the jungle, hopefully warding off some of the more malevolent ones in the process. After talking to the architects of the court, they have come up with a blueprint for a temple they vow would be the grandest temple in all of the Lupulan. Should we begin construction?"
 lupulan_events.2000.a: "Build the temple."
 lupulan_events.2000.b: "Is this really the best use of our limited resources?"

 lupulan_events.2001.t: "The Other Temple"
 lupulan_events.2001.d: "One of our neighbors has built a temple they are claiming is the “grandest temple in all of the Lupulan.” This would make their grand temple grander than our grand temple, a situation which is of course intolerable. The clergy are demanding revisions to our temple to make it grander than their temple again. Shall we indulge them?"
 lupulan_events.2001.a: "I am Sri Baginda, and I will have the grandest temple."
 lupulan_events.2001.b: "The architecture of the temple’s towers has been looking dated…"
 lupulan_events.2001.c: "Is this really the best use of our limited resources?"

 lupulan_events.2002.t: "Favor of the Nang-Ta-Khian"
 lupulan_events.2002.d: "While on a trip to [target_province.GetName] to oversee construction and development in the area, the $MONARCHTITLE$ was accosted by a small group of Nang-Ta-Khian, one of the many kinds of jungle spirits of the Lupulan. Reportedly, all the new construction going on has infringed on their jungle home. They would greatly appreciate it if a more slow and steady approach could be taken, and have promised to cooperate with the crown to the fullest extent possible if their request is honored. \n\nOur advisors are split on whether or not to agree. Although the favor of the Nang-Ta-Khian would be helpful and it is important to live in harmony with the spirits, we suspect some radical changes to [target_province.GetName]’s development would have to take place in order to satisfy them."
 lupulan_events.2002.a: "That sounds sensible."
 lupulan_events.2002.b: "We will develop what we want, when we want."

 lupulan_events.2003.t: "The Middleman"
 lupulan_events.2003.d: "During this year’s tribute period, one of our weaker tributaries has claimed that they do not have the resources to pay us our due, citing additional tribute being levied on them by one of our other tributaries. We have sent the tax collectors to investigate, and sure enough, the tributary is both broke and paying double tribute. \n\nIt is our responsibility to ensure that the tribes under our care are being stewarded responsibly, and to have our tributaries exacting tribute from our other tributaries before we ourselves are paid threatens to undermine the system of tribute, turning it into a confusing web of obligations. What should our response be?"
 lupulan_events.2003.a: "Request that the smaller tributary make up their obligations next year."
 lupulan_events.2003.b: "Go to the others, and force them to pay double tribute to compensate."
 lupulan_events.2003.c: "The Sri Baginda cannot referee every petty squabble."
 lupulan_events.2003.tooltip1: "We will gain one year of [subject1.GetName]'s tribute in crowns!"
 lupulan_events.2003.tooltip2: "We will gain one year of [subject2.GetName]'s tribute in crowns!"

 lupulan_events.2004.t: "Tribute to the Lupulan"
 lupulan_events.2004.d: "To live in harmony with the spirits means paying them proper respect, and there is no spirit more important than the Great Spirit of the Lupulan. It has been a while since our last sacrifice to the Great Spirit, and the clergy worry that the Lupulan grows restless. Shall we offer another sacrifice to the Great Lizard?"
 lupulan_events.2004.a: "We shall drape the entire jungle in finery"
 lupulan_events.2004.b: "Let’s not break the bank."
 lupulan_events.2004.c: "Surely the Lupulan does not need our trifles."

 lupulan_events.2005.t: "Those Who Came Before"
 lupulan_events.2005.d: "While sitting down to a midday meal today, our ruler was confronted with the spirit of one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great great great-grandfathers, who claims that the nation’s decadent and newfangled ways will destroy everyone involved unless we repent and begin undoing the last hundred or so years of reform. \n\nThe ministers have begun investigating the possibility. Preliminary reports indicate that this would be a very bad idea indeed, and that the nation is not likely to be destroyed for its “immoral and unholy excess” anytime soon. That being said, the direct political support of one of our ancestors would do great things for our right to rule. We must give the ancestor an answer soon."
 lupulan_events.2005.a: "We repent, revered ancestor!"
 lupulan_events.2005.b: "Distract the old man until he gets bored and forgets about us."
 lupulan_events.2005.c: "See if some compromise can be worked out."

 lupulan_events.2006.t: "The Porcelain Herald"
 lupulan_events.2006.d: "Across all the Lupulan, the whistling people are known for three things: their porcelain-white skin, their unearthly beauty, and their pathological distrust of outsiders. It is usually the case that the only time outsiders interact with the whistling people is during diplomatic meetings, but perhaps if our state searches hard enough and devotes enough funds to the project, we might be able to find one willing to serve as a court advisor. \n\nThis would be a diplomatic coup for our nation, but the jungle is vast and there is no guarantee we will come back with anyone at all."
 lupulan_events.2006.a: "Launch an exhaustive search of the Lupulan: we will find our man."
 lupulan_events.2006.b: "Sounds expensive."
 lupulan_events.2006.c: "I’m sure we can find someone."

 lupulan_events.2007.t: "Durian Durian"
 lupulan_events.2007.d: "A curious case has come before the Sri Baginda. For as long as any of the elders in [target_province.GetName] can remember, the border between two tribes has been defined by a river snaking between their lands. The river recently changed course, however, and this has subtracted a small amount of territory from the lands of one tribe and given it to another. \n\nThe tribes usually would not be inclined to war over whatever collection of dirt and insects changed nationalities, but this is a special case: the territory that changed riverbanks included a grove of durian trees, with fruit so sweet the people come from miles around just to taste it. This being the case, the tribe on the side of the riverbank with the durian fruit is demanding a literal interpretation of the riverbank rule, while the tribe on the opposite side of the riverbank claims that the river was only meant to be a loose guide to the border, and that their claim to the grove far predates any changes in riverflow anyhow. \n\nIn a last effort to forestall war, the two tribes have asked the Sri Baginda to make a ruling on exactly who the grove really belongs to."
 lupulan_events.2007.a: "The tribe on the grove’s side of the river shall rule the grove."
 lupulan_events.2007.b: "The tribe with the oldest claim shall rule the grove."
 lupulan_events.2007.c: "Only the king of kings shall have the king of fruits."

 lupulan_events.2008.t: "The Exorcist"
 lupulan_events.2008.d: "A letter has arrived from [demon_target.GetName] today. For months, their armies have been involved in a pitched battle against a particularly old and powerful Hantu Raya that seems to have made it its personal mission to murder every single person living within their borders. \n\nWhile the power of their entire army would surely be enough to overwhelm the Hantu Raya in fair combat, the blasted spirit has adopted hit and run tactics. The conflict is therefore rather like attempting to hunt down a madman with demonic powers, and even all their men cannot canvas the entire rainforest. Therefore, [demon_target.GetName] has appealed to us as their overlord for our assistance in this matter."
 lupulan_events.2008.a: "We will send them troops for their efforts."
 lupulan_events.2008.b: "Let’s pretend we never received this."

 lupulan_events.2009.t: "A Great Festival"
 lupulan_events.2009.d: "The children run through the glowing streets in masks. Young lovers twine in quiet nooks and the old hold hands and look on fondly, remembering their courtship days.The buskers weave tales of glories past as the vendors hawk their food and sell it for a song, for tonight there is enough for everyone. \n\nTonight is the festival to celebrate the spirits, and as always the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been invited to speak to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people. Already the fireworks boom overhead: the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not have long to decide what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will say. What should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] speak on?"
 lupulan_events.2009.a: "Joy and peace."
 lupulan_events.2009.b: "Wealth and prosperity."
 lupulan_events.2009.c: "The glories of the future."
 lupulan_events.2009.e: "Kingship, and all the kings who came before."

 lupulan_events.2010.t: "The Court of the Sri Baginda"
 lupulan_events.2010.d: "The delegations of two of our tributaries came before the court today for a scheduled thirty-fourth round of argumentation over which nation should have the honor of appointing the Sri Baginda’s footstool carrier. As is tradition, the Sri Baginda served as judge to the debate from when the sun rose until when the sun set. \n\nAfter the other business of the court began late at night, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] came before the Sri Baginda with a question: might it not be better to overhaul the way petitions before the Sri Baginda are processed, for everyone’s sake? A system of regional courts could be established through the Lupulan with magistrates given authority to act on behalf of the Sri Baginda, so that only the most important cases consume the Sri Baginda’s time, and it would likely be more convenient for our subjects to avoid having to travel the entire Lupulan as well."
 lupulan_events.2010.a: "This seems like a great service we could do for our subjects."
 lupulan_events.2010.b: "Our subjects would undoubtedly pay large sums for such a service."
 lupulan_events.2010.c: "I like watching them bicker."

 lupulan_events.2011.t: "A United Front"
 lupulan_events.2011.d: "The assorted desert tribes of Sirtan have long been a problem for the Lupulan: severed from their connection to the spirits, they have long sent raiders south out of spite to loot our villages and kill our people. Their experience hiding in the desert wastes means that they cannot ever truly be subdued, so an all out conquest would be both fruitless and painful. \n\nHowever, a little bit of effort increasing the Lupulan’s defenses through jungle garrisons so that the northern tribes can put up a better defense might go a long way towards protecting the entire Lupulan. Political support has recently grown among the other tribes for such an effort. Should we seize the opportunity?"
 lupulan_events.2011.a: "They shall not pass!"
 lupulan_events.2011.b: "Thanks, but no thanks."
 lupulan_events.2011.c: "A grand idea! We will be in charge."

 lupulan_events.2012.t: "The River Toll"
 lupulan_events.2012.d: "There has long been an informal agreement among all tribes of the Lupulan that the rivers, no matter whose territory they pass through, are to remain open for trade and navigation except in times of war or extraordinary hardship. Unfortunately, the fools downriver of us appear not to have received this message. \n\nDirectly at the confluence of two of the largest rivers in the region, they have set up a military checkpoint which they claim is intended to “protect regional commerce.” Of course, the only thing they are warding off is profits, because every merchant who wishes to pass onwards with their goods is forced to pay a toll in proportion to the value of the goods they are carrying. \n\nThe nation’s merchants are up in arms, and if we don’t do something soon they just might organize an invading army themselves."
 lupulan_events.2012.a: "Issue an edict in the name of the Sri Baginda that this cannot stand."
 lupulan_events.2012.b: "Perhaps they will let our war canoes pass."
 lupulan_events.2012.c: "Embargo them until they discontinue this ridiculous toll."
 lupulan_events.2012.e: "Perhaps we could be persuaded to drop our objections."

 lupulan_events.2013.t: "Teak Wood Trouble"
 lupulan_events.2013.d: "The stream of canoes coming from our neighbors in [unlucky_guys.GetName] along our rivers to be sold has recently slowed to a trickle. It appears to be the case that their area is experiencing an especially severe outbreak of teak moths this year, and there is scarcely a clearing of teak trees in their entire nation that has not been affected. \n\nDue to teak wood’s role in their canoe building all of [unlucky_guys.GetName] has precious little to barter with their fellow tribes, and they would likely appreciate any form of economic relief we might be able to provide to them."
 lupulan_events.2013.a: "Of course we will help our friends."
 lupulan_events.2013.b: "Sounds like a seller’s market!"

 lupulan_events.2014.t: "The Tiger in the Trees"
 lupulan_events.2014.d: "While in the jungle with his retinue, our ruler spotted something moving among the trees that looked a whole lot like a white tiger! This was corroborated by other members of the retinue, and there is universal consensus in the palace that this indicates our ruler is both spirit-blessed and is in possession of a uniquely good and just soul. \n\nNow that this has been established, the only question is how best to spread the word."
 lupulan_events.2014.a: "Let’s be subtle about it."
 lupulan_events.2014.b: "We should make a royal announcement."
 lupulan_events.2014.c: "Make sure everyone in the Lupulan has heard this news yesterday."

 lupulan_events.2015.t: "The Great Flood"
 lupulan_events.2015.d: "Over the last few months, our advisors and mages looked upon the riverbanks with trepidation. They agreed that all signs indicate that this year’s rains threatened devastation, and they were proven right when the rivers in [flood_province.GetName] burst over their banks in a dreadful flood. \n\nThe regional administrators report that there is not a single riverside village untouched in the entire province, and that social order is already beginning to break down. These reports have been corroborated by the influx of pleas from the area for aid or any form of relief we might be able to provide, which are growing more numerous and desperate by the day."
 lupulan_events.2015.a: "Spare no effort: our people will be made whole."
 lupulan_events.2015.b: "We must at least help rebuild."
 lupulan_events.2015.c: "We cannot control the waters."
