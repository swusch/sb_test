 roilsard_attract_adventurers_title:0 "Attract Adventurers"
 roilsard_attract_adventurers_desc:0 "With the end of the Greentide in Escann so has come the time for many of the brave men and women fighting in the war to return as well, while Roilsard is full of these brave people our primary contingent in the war came from the síl Vivin run Company of the Thorn. With them now returning home, we should see to it to invest properly in housing and servicing these experienced veterans so as to have an army able to defend our reunited Roilsard from any invaders."

 roilsard_permanent_arms_title:0 "Permanent Arms"
 roilsard_permanent_arms_desc:0 "While no one can doubt their military experience we have quickly found an issue with our idea of an army of adventurers, they are too few on account of most remaining to continue the fight in Escann. While we can still maintain a core of skilled veterans to boost morale within our troops, a proper army needs size, a size we need to find among properly trained commoners and peasants, no feudal levy loyal to one of the four houses, but loyal to Roilsard, to their home."

 roilsard_jacques_reforms_title:0 "Jacques's Reforms"
 roilsard_jacques_reforms_desc:0 "Jacques síl Vivin was a competent Roilsardi commander during the Lilac Wars, while he served in our war effort early on in the war, he was later fired by the ruling síl Roilsard under vague accusations of treachery that we now in hindsight can see was due to being a part of the rival síl Vivin family. Competent and experienced, had he not been fired, he may very much have led us to victory during the disastrous battle of Redfort. Nonetheless, while the years have gone by, he still lives, looking spry for his age and has even developed upon his old ideas to fit the ever-changing battlefield. Now we shall not commit the same mistake that was done during the Lilac Wars, and instead we shall use his knowledge to make our army one that any Lorentish knight fears."

 roilsard_tretunic_roots_title:0 "Tretunic Roots"
 roilsard_tretunic_roots_desc:0 "Long ago the Duchy of Roilsard was once considered part of the Kingdom of Tretun. However, the ancient kingdom is now gone, and its pauper remnants are now under the wine lord of Rubenaire, and we as the Roilsardi people are resurgent. We must destroy the last vestiges of the Tretunic fools once and for all, making it clear that Roilsard bows to no King."

 roilsard_the_thorned_ravens_flight_title:0 "The Thorned Raven's Flight"
 roilsard_the_thorned_ravens_flight_desc:0 "After her departure many were sceptical that Madaléin would return, fearing she would meet a similar fate to those who sought out Aelantir in the past, sceptical of the rumours coming from Lorent of a rediscovered Aelantir. Madaléin, however, did return, bringing with her news of her expedition, confirming the existence of Aelantir and opening many opportunities for exploration to the east."

 roilsard_a_base_of_operations_title:0 "A Base of Operations"
 roilsard_a_base_of_operations_desc:0 "The Roilsardi spirit is an adventurous one and after the return of the expedition many brave pioneers sought to settle this new land in the name of Roilsard. All we need to do is finance them."

 roilsard_sarhal_venture_title:0 "Sarhal Venture!"
 roilsard_sarhal_venture_desc:0 "When we discovered Sarhal, it was an enterprising Roilsardi officer by the name of Graham síl na Loop that discovered the natural harbor that is now – in spite of a failed attempt on his part to call it Loopathíl, which even his noble relatives back home found absurd – called Graham’s Landing in his name.\nGraham’s Landing and the surrounding provinces, on the coast of the Ironwood jungles of “Dao Nako”, are of increasing importance to our Sarhaly venture. It is crucial that we establish a firm foothold in Sarhal so as to project power into the Sarhaly interior and attain a proper return on our investments in the region."

 roilsard_new_toarnaire_title:0 "New Toarnaire"
 roilsard_new_toarnaire_desc:0 "In the region called Fahvanosy by its barbaric inhabitants, we found a region that reminded us at once of Toarnaire – despite the fact that some Exwesser explorer had already named it “New Hookfield”. We established a provisional settlement therein and called it New Toarnaire, then set about asserting control over the territories surrounding it. Now, the city we established is rapidly matching the venerable cities of our homeland in its splendor. Let us consecrate it to the gods and give it space to produce wares and trade with the wider world. Let us turn New Hookfield into New Toarnaire, and make it a truly Roilsardi settlement!"

 roilsard_a_clove_in_thorns_title:0 "A Clove in Thorns"
 roilsard_a_clove_in_thorns_desc:0 "The spices of Fahvanosy used to belong to this or that primitive halfling polity, and the barbarians would haggle fearlessly with all comers. Now we own the spices. Anyone who seeks cloves, pepper, cardamom – anything else that could add flavour to a bland meal – must haggle with us. The Fahvanosy venture that we have established, with New Toarnaire as its focal point, will be a great source of profit both for us and for our trading company in the region – the spice will flow!"

 roilsard_spice_up_the_trade_title:0 "Spice Up the Trade"
 roilsard_spice_up_the_trade_desc:0 "Broadly speaking, we own all the cloves and all the spices in Fahvanosy. We have, moreover, massively increased both the production of the spices in question as well as the mercantile infrastructure required for us to profit as much as possible from their sale. As a result, enterprising Roilsardi are trickling south to these places, such as Teramzarai, to make a new life for themselves in a land so different from that of their ancestors. Sure, most of these colonists are dying from horrific tropical diseases and vengeful natives – but there is as much opportunity as there is danger in Sarhal..."

 roilsard_roilsard_unchallenged_title:0 "Roilsard Unchallenged"
 roilsard_roilsard_unchallenged_desc:0 "Others have cothons and seawalls - we have a thicket of thorns on the water protecting our realm. The Roilsardi Navy is the greatest navy in Cannor. It is the solace of its people, the help of its allies, and the dread of its enemies. What is more, thanks to the power we project in trade and naval might, the Bay of Wines has displaced the likes of Anbenncóst as the primary trading center of the world.\n\nLet none question the might and glory of the Thorns of the Seas! All shall behold our glory, or fall to their knees in despair of our might! And when they surrender, seek accommodation with us, their subjugation shall be on our terms!"

 roilsard_a_seat_of_power_title:0 "A Seat of Power"
 roilsard_a_seat_of_power_desc:0 "With the reunification of the country complete, the síl Saloren have come with a promising proposition of a fixed capital in Saloren for the entire country, rather than each house having their own seats of power. While clearly benefiting themselves, Saloren offers promise due both to its fortifications and its distance from the rose that divided us. No matter if we take them up on the offer or not, building the necessary infrastructure to build up Saloren as either our primary or secondary seat of power would be a good idea and would surely greatly please the house of Saloren."

 roilsard_the_saloren_title:0 "The Saloren"
 roilsard_the_saloren_desc:0 "With our rise in power, it was only a matter of time until we seized upon what makes the Wine Lords truly powerful. Let us put our own stamp on the Wineries within our domain, creating a truly Saloreni flavour, and a central market to distribute it. This will both enrich our cultural influence and wealth, as well as fund the construction of a most impressive Capital."

 roilsard_expanding_the_city_title:0 "Expanding the City"
 roilsard_expanding_the_city_desc:0 "While historically being seen as outside the power struggles in Roilsard, being not owned by any of the four houses, Toarnaire ended up, alongside many other wine merchants, revolting during the Lilac Wars. With this rebellion now stamped out of our city, we must see to both building up the city as our central trading hub in the Bay of Wines, but also to reassure the merchants that their interests are a part of the interests of a united Roilsard, so as to never fracture again."

 roilsard_expand_the_merchant_navy_title:0 "Expand the Merchant Navy"
 roilsard_expand_the_merchant_navy_desc:0 "A powerful navy controls the oceans around Lencenor, and protects our interests abroad. While we cannot hope to match the navies of the larger nations, we can expand the merchant marine of the State, increasing our own profits, and creating a bulwark against hostile elements seeking to ravage our independent merchants."

 roilsard_befriend_minar_temple_title:0 "Befriend Minar Temple"
 roilsard_befriend_minar_temple_desc:0 "Following the Lilac Wars, Minar Temple was left in a precarious position, beset on all sides by would-be conquerors; they were forced to turn to Wineport, our old rivals, for protection. Now that we have pushed the merchants out of our territory and proven them incapable of protecting Minar, perhaps it would be best if we were to offer Minar our protection instead, in exchange for their recognition in the liberation of the remaining Minari in the eastern Winebay."

 roilsard_reaching_across_the_bay_title:0 "Reaching Across the Bay"
 roilsard_reaching_across_the_bay_desc:0 "We have crushed Wineport and the rebels, and freed the Minari under their boot. However, there are still some Minari that have yet to come under our banner and the war for the Bay is far from complete. We should offer Minar Temple a position in our realm as a direct vassal of our ruler."

 roilsard_entangling_the_wine_lords_title:0 "Entangling the Wine Lords"
 roilsard_entangling_the_wine_lords_desc:0 "The Wine Lords of Lencenor are a decadent lot, and unlike us, they stand disunited, fighting each other in petty skirmishes and small wars, seeking to gain the upper hand on their fellows. We should show them a new way, united under Roilsard they will have no need for petty squabbles. Of course, controlling their land has other benefits, such as allowing for greater control over wine production in Lencenor, but that is at most a fortunate coincidence."

 roilsard_those_who_abandoned_us_title:0 "Those Who Abandoned Us"
 roilsard_those_who_abandoned_us_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars, the duke of Deranne abandoned us, surrendering to Lorent and leaving Roilsard to die at the hands of the Lorentish. The time has come to take our revenge. We will march and Deranne and do to them what they allowed to happen to us. Deranne will be burned to the ground."

 roilsard_beyond_lorents_reach_title:0 "Beyond Lorent's Reach"
 roilsard_beyond_lorents_reach_desc:0 "Lorent holds a monopoly on wine exports within Lencenor, and they charge huge tariffs on our merchants, costing them dearly. For this reason, the síl na Loop have approached the síl Vivin, hoping to use their overseas expansion and the goods traded there, to supplement lost profits."

 roilsard_hunting_the_bloodsuckers_title:0 "Hunting the Bloodsuckers"
 roilsard_hunting_the_bloodsuckers_desc:0 "Our conquistadors have returned with word of the lands south of our colonies, and what we have heard disgusted us. Horrific leech-like creatures that feed on the blood of men. We must do all we can to remove these abominations from Halann, with the Leechdens being our prize for this noble task."

 roilsard_taming_the_wildlands_title:0 "Taming the Wildlands"
 roilsard_taming_the_wildlands_desc:0 "Amadia is a realm plagued by wild magic – storms of prismatic energy, that warps and distorts the workings of magic itself. But Roilsard does not shy away from the thorns that adorn a rose. We have seized control of the key cities of Cara Laquén, Igarunel, and Nel Silir – strategically established trade centers all across the region of Amadia, developed our settlers’ lands, projected power into the lands under our control – and with this done, the damestear-wealth that lies beneath the surface shall be ours! Riches beyond imagining!\nAnd with the backing of the nobility back in the homeland, the Amadian colony will forge on ever further – while we look south for new riches. The great wealth and mighty cities of theKheionai and Taychend have drawn the interest of our banking classes. We might benefit from further drawing their attention to the subcontinent…."

 roilsard_south_aelantir_markets_title:0 "South Aelantir Markets"
 roilsard_south_aelantir_markets_desc:0 "How much we have profited! How great the riches that enter the privy purse! Through a mix of force and diplomacy guided by the shrewdness of our people, we have attained total market control in the south of Aelantir – the relics and raw materials of Taychend, the manufactured goods of the Kheionai, are taken by our ships, and sold across the world!\nWith large swathes of Kheionai and Taychend under the control of good and loyal friends, we are now well-placed to take full advantage of the rich trade routes of the southern lands. May the rose of our nation grow ever-more beautiful!"

 roilsard_thorn_crowns_dynasties_title:0 "Thorn Crown's Dynasties"
 roilsard_thorn_crowns_dynasties_desc:0 "Long has Roilsard been disunited, even during the Lilac Wars where we were nominally united under Rean VII síl Roilsard the nobles of the realm bickered and backstabbed, and the end result? We all suffered.\n\nThe time has come to put petty house politics behind us and move forward as a single entity, for what is good for one Roilsardi is good for us all."

 roilsard_restore_the_vinyards_title:0 "Restore the Vineyards"
 roilsard_restore_the_vinyards_desc:0 "During the Lilac Wars many a noble vineyard was destroyed, and many of our people were forced into poverty. Restoring the Vineyards is a necessity if we are to recover from the devastation of the Lilac Wars and rebuild Roilsard."

 roilsard_public_university_title:0 "Public University"
 roilsard_public_university_desc:0 "In Rubenaire there is a university where many of the Lorentish Nobility study, learning the twisted truths of the Lorentish, and destroying our identity. Our nobility studying at such a university cannot be allowed. We should build our own, in Toarnaire, and allow all the people of Roilsard to attend, where they will learn the glory of Roilsard's past and the bright future that lies ahead."

 roilsard_professional_standing_army_title:0 "Professional Standing Army"
 roilsard_professional_standing_army_desc:0 "The Roilsardi are renowned worldwide for their military prowess and many of them serve as mercenaries in realms around Cannor and yet our armies do not live up to this reputation. A new commander has arisen, named Jacque síl Vivin, a direct descendant of the Jacques of old! He has identified the issue to be a severe lack of drill within the army, and claims that during his inspection of the army many soldiers disregarded his clear orders, and so has outlined a clear set of reforms that would allow our army to live up to their fearsome reputation."

 roilsard_the_thorn_gardens_title:0 "The Thorn Gardens"
 roilsard_the_thorn_gardens_desc:0 "We have triumphed over our rivals and taken revenge for the misdeeds of the past, but that does not mean they are forgotten. Using the spoils gained from our subjugation of Lencenor we will construct a grand garden of thorns, to burn into our history the unforgivable horrors of the past and how Roilsard overcame them. We will not forget."

 roilsard_roilsard_indivisible_title:0 "Roilsard Indivisible"
 roilsard_roilsard_indivisible_desc:0 "Our enemies lie defeated, their realms incorporated into ours. The emperor is nothing more than our puppet. Our people stand free of any foreign influence, and they stand proud. Never again will we repeat the mistakes of the past, never again shall Roilsardi fight Roilsardi, never again shall we be split. The Roilsardi will stand together, and they will die together, for Roilsard is, and always shall be, indivisible."

 roilsard_swords_and_plougshares_title:0 "Swords and Ploughshares"
 roilsard_swords_and_plougshares_desc:0 "While we are now whole, we still live in fear of a possible Lorentish invasion to once more fracture us. But as we have proved and shall continue to prove, the people of Roilsard are strong, and our army relies not on elite knights but on that strong populace. We should hand out pikes to every man in Roilsard so that they may be ready for the inevitable charge of the Lorentish knights."

 roilsard_restore_local_fortifications_title:0 "Restore Local Fortifications"
 roilsard_restore_local_fortifications_desc:0 "While we cannot guarantee the crushing defeats of the past could harry our future, we can guarantee the defence of the home territories, restoring the abandoned keeps and castles of the old ages to project their power back into the surrounding fields. This has the beneficial side effect of making the peasantry feel safer from marauding bandits as well as foreign armies."

 roilsard_cooperation_of_the_peasantry_title:0 "Co-operation of the Peasantry"
 roilsard_cooperation_of_the_peasantry_desc:0 "Our nation is built upon the people, and on a grander scale, the nation reflects the desires of those that live there. We saw what happens when the nation loses the loyalty of those it rules, with the rebellion of the Wine Lords, and we must make an active effort to ensure the continued loyalty of our own people."

 roilsard_roilsard_resurgence_resurgence_title:0 "Roilsard Resurgence"
 roilsard_roilsard_resurgence_resurgence_desc:0 "The vineyards of Roilsard are impressive, but they are a shadow of what they once were, ravaged by the Lilac Wars. We shall rebuild them, even more grand than what they were. They shall be the crown jewel in our rebuilt Nation, a treasure we shall not lose again."

 roilsard_end_lorentish_ties_title:0 "End Lorentish Ties"
 roilsard_end_lorentish_ties_desc:0 "Following the reformation of Roilsard there seems to have been some uncertainty as to where we stand relative to Lorent, and they have sent many a diplomat to our realm seeking to re-establish our vassalage. This will not do, Roilsard is not Lorentish, and we should make that clear to them."

 roilsard_thorn_in_lorents_side_title:0 "A Thorn in Lorent's Side"
 roilsard_thorn_in_lorents_side_desc:0 "We have seized Carneter from the hands of Eilísin, and yet the duchy lies open unprotected against any possible Lorentish invasion. Further, the emperor expects us to fortify our lands after the aid they sent, and the síl Roilsard seek to make good of this deal."

 roilsard_expand_the_frontier_title:0 "Expand the Frontier"
 roilsard_expand_the_frontier_desc:0 "The county of Roilsard, seat of the síl Roilsard, sits on the border of Lorent and is, much to their dismay, often the first county to fall in the case of a Lorentish invasion. The síl Roilsard have long sought to change this, moving the Lorentish frontier further from their lands, should the opportunity present itself they would certainly be grateful if we were to conquer the nearby Lorentish towns."

 roilsard_around_the_bay_title:0 "Around the Bay"
 roilsard_around_the_bay_desc:0 "After the initial conquest of Lorent an opportunity has arisen, if we were to take the duchy of Lower Bloodwine we would be able to connect our lands in the Winebay and Roilsard proper and cut Lorent off from the Bay entirely."

 roilsard_those_who_betrayed_us_title:0 "Those Who Betrayed Us"
 roilsard_those_who_betrayed_us_desc:0 "Roilsard was once a vassal of Lorent, however during the Second Lilac War they proved themselves unfit rulers, asking for levees and taxes that our people were unable to sustain, and so we were forced to secede and join the empire, unfortunately the Damerians were defeated, and with them our then ruler Rean VII síl Roilsard who fought bravely until the end. Following this, Lorent did the unthinkable, shattering the duchy of Roilsard and giving our lands as a prize to their ally Rubenaire. Whilst they may have shattered our realm, they did not shatter our spirit, and Roilsard fought on. Today we have shown the grave error of their ways, and they will be made to pay dearly for their crimes."

 roilsard_thorns_above_roses_title:0 "Thorns Above Roses"
 roilsard_thorns_above_roses_desc:0 "We have fought for many years against the Lorentish hegemony and the petty wine lords and today our efforts have come to bear: Lencenor has fallen before. Long gone are the days of Lorentish dominion and prancing nobles. The Lorentish rose falls, and the Roilsardi thorns rise above it."

 roilsard_a_home_for_the_lost_title:0 "A Home for the Lost"
 roilsard_a_home_for_the_lost_desc:0 "Following the Aldresian Crusade many Roilsardi settled in the eastern borders of the empire, but despite of the people living there have had their Roilsardi heritage suppressed and see themselves as ‘Arannese’ rather than Roilsardi. An exception to this trend is Toarnen, where the nobility continues to practise Roilsardi traditions, preferring to style themselves as Roilsardi. We should make an effort to further spread the Toarnese influence in the Borders, so the people living there can embrace their true Roilsardi roots."

 roilsard_ending_ravens_feud_title:0 "Ending the Ravens' Feud"
 roilsard_ending_ravens_feud_desc:0 "The síl Vivin are among the most prominent members of the Roilsardi nobility, with their family being one of the 4 permitted to wear the crown of thorns. They are famed worldwide for their adventurer spirit and unwavering bravery. However, in the easternmost borders of the empire, our distance kin disgrace themselves. Asheniande, Corvuria, pale raven, black raven, it matters not. We are all united by our shared heritage, and we will do whatever it takes to have them realise this fact."
 
 roilsard_family_reunion_title:0 "Family Reunion"
 roilsard_family_reunion_desc:0 "When Roilsardi crusaders marched to the Borders to fight the White Pestilence, the síl Vivins came to dominate much of the east. But they were fractious, divided, and all can see it – the síl Vivin family has fought itself for too long. The new Roilsard has permitted too much strife, too much fighting amidst flesh and blood. With Dostanor and the Folly ours, we must instill in our wayward cousins the unity of Lencori culture once more – we must achieve the proper union of our kin into a single whole, marching together into the future! Let the old Raven Throne rest at long last. Let the decrepit, ossified ways of Corvuria and Asheniande be left behind, and a new Roilsardi culture assert itself in the borders - as Cromorri!"

 roilsard_protect_against_dominion_title:0 "Protect Against Dominion"
 roilsard_protect_against_dominion_desc:0 "To the north looms Lorent, looming over us, ready to strike at any time, and we cannot stand alone. We need to find allies, and powerful ones at that, if we hope to remain independent. So that we may yet rebuff the Lorentish."

 roilsard_build_imperial_embassy_title:0 "Build Imperial Embassy"
 roilsard_build_imperial_embassy_desc:0 "While we shall repeat our commitment to a strong Imperial Seat, we should also strive to play the game of houses amongst the other leading nobles of the realm. Let us create a magnificent diplomatic district in Loopuis to house and entertain our Imperial Guests. And more importantly, curry favour with their powerful masters. Solely for the betterment of Roilsard of course..."

 roilsard_reaffirm_imperial_ties_title:0 "Reaffirm Imperial Ties"
 roilsard_reaffirm_imperial_ties_desc:0 "Now is the opportune hour! Lorent weakened, Roilsard independent – but we need to seek out true allies and lords to support the functioning of the Roilsardi state. We have had the good fortune of living under the suzerainty of the Dove Throne, and have exhausted ourselves in their service. Now let us demand a return on that investment - we should ask for reaffirmation of our ties to the Empire!"

 roilsard_imperial_military_aid_title:0 "Imperial Military Aid"
 roilsard_imperial_military_aid_desc:0 "As a member of the empire, we should petition the empire to invest in our lands and defences as a border frontier of the empire, to both enrich the imperial lands, and strengthen them against would-be conquerors against Anbennar’s many enemies. We are, after all, the first point of defence against a Lorentish invasion of the West Dameshead."

 roilsard_imperial_carneteria_title:0 "Imperial Carneteria"
 roilsard_imperial_carneteria_desc:0 "Carneteria is considered part of the empire, but it lies outside the influence of the emperor, as the new defenders of the imperial border with Lorent it would be wise for us to restore this duchy to the Empire, strengthening our position in the empire and weakening Lorentish influence in the region."

 roilsard_the_western_march_title:0 "The Western March"
 roilsard_the_western_march_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves the real protectors of the western borders, having pushed the Lorentish out of the region entirely. The dukes of Wesdam however have proven themselves unworthy of the title, having betrayed even their own kin in the Lilac Wars and allowing the Lorentish into the empire unopposed. Perhaps it is time Wesdam lost the marquisate."

 roilsard_seize_the_imperial_fleet_title:0 "Seize the Imperial Fleet"
 roilsard_seize_the_imperial_fleet_desc:0 "As the new marquisate of the western borders it seems only logical that Roilsard would bring the people of the Dameshead into their realm, the woods of Woodwell and ports Neckcliffe would serve us well in building a great fleet to rival the Lorentish and, perhaps, to pursue our own interests in the region..."

 roilsard_imperial_lencenor_title:0 "Imperial Lencenor"
 roilsard_imperial_lencenor_desc:0 "A great injustice has been committed upon Roilsard, we control the majority of the Dameshead and are responsible for its security, and yet we are represented by the fools in Pearlsedge, seizing their realm would make our claim undeniable, and the emperor will almost certainly respect our rightful claim to the electorate."

 roilsard_the_imperial_seat_of_power_title:0 "The Imperial Seat of Power"
 roilsard_the_imperial_seat_of_power_desc:0 "The emperor has denied our request. It is clear that if we are to be recognized in the empire then we must do so by force, the imperial capital of Anbenncóst lies not far from our realm and with the imperial fleet and our grand army besieging it would be an easy task. Once we control the capital, the emperor will have no choice but to give in to our demands."

 roilsard_a_wandering_thorn_title:0 "A Wandering Thorn"
 roilsard_a_wandering_thorn_desc:0 "In the borders there are many feuding counts and dukes, most are of little important to us but Toarnen sticks out as a stray thorn, the síl na Loop family holds much influence in the realm and the rulers have expressed great interest in re-uniting their country with Roilsard and being recognized as true Roilsardi nobility."

 roilsard_our_lost_kin_title:0 "Our Lost Kin"
 roilsard_our_lost_kin_desc:0 "Following the Aldresian Crusade many Roilsardi settled in the eastern borders of the empire, but despite of the people living there have had their Roilsardi heritage suppressed and see themselves as ‘Arannese’ rather than Roilsardi. An exception to this trend is Toarnen, where the nobility continues to practise Roilsardi traditions, preferring to style themselves as Roilsardi. We should make an effort to further spread the Toarnese influence in the Borders, so the people living there can embrace their true Roilsardi roots."

 roilsard_unite_the_marches_title:0 "Unite the Marches"
 roilsard_unite_the_marches_desc:0 "With both the eastern and western marquisates secured under one realm, Roilsard has become the protector of both borders of the empire. By leveraging this position, we would be able to have the emperor guarantee funds dedicated to the upkeep of our fortifications and armies. An arrangement that would certainly benefit us both."

 roilsard_the_second_homeland_title:0 "The Second Homeland"
 roilsard_the_second_homeland_desc:0 "We have brought it about at long last!\n\nThe lands of Highcliff have finally attained the development and infrastructure they sorely needed to become truly worthy of the Cromorri people. As our nascent culture begins to take hold in these prosperous lands, we watch with eager eyes as markets begin to sell the crafts of Highcliff to customers from near and far. The conversation of Cromorri and foreigners from a thousand homes, the smells of foods and the sight of wares from an ocean away - all this was unheard of to our ancestors, who could only ever dream of travelling to the next town over. Freed from these fetters, we joyously look on as this region of Highcliff, once a mere backwater, transforms itself into something truly beautiful: a second homeland for our people!"

 roilsard_roilsard_united_title:0 "Roilsard United"
 roilsard_roilsard_united_desc:0 "The coastal lands of Highcliff are slowly being returned to their former glory. The once-ruined lands in that area, blasted by the war and folly of the Arranese, are prosperous and industrious once more. Cromorri culture, a suitable mix of what was and what will be, has taken full hold in their midst. What is more, our northern fellows in Asheniande have been bound to us by oaths of loyalty, trust, and mutual benefit.\n\nIt has come time for us to make clear to all of Halcann what we knew for much longer: the Borders and Roilsard are united as one under our exalted rule."

 flavor_roilsard.1.t:0 "The Thorned Raven"
 flavor_roilsard.1.d:0 "The síl Vivin are well known for their adventurous spirit and brave conquests in the Aldresian Crusade, fighting to end the White Pestilence. Recently word of a new frontier has arisen, rumours are spreading that an elf from Lorent has begun an expedition toward Aelantir and, unlike previous expeditions, has returned successfully!\n\nMadaléin síl Vivin is one such person who believes these rumours, forced to leave her home in Corvuria by the encroaching folly she seeks to make the journey across the seas to investigate the truth of these rumours. Due to her Corvurian heritage, many have begun calling her the ‘Thorned Raven’."
 flavor_roilsard.1.a:0 "And so the Raven shall fly."

 flavor_roilsard.2.t:0 "A New Capital"
 flavor_roilsard.2.d:0 "A debate has arisen in Roilsard about the location of the capital of our duchy, with two clear sides of the conflict having arisen.\n\nThe síl Saloren and their supporters argue the strategic location of Saloren, and it's already strong fortifications make its location a prime position for the capital.\n\nThe síl Roilsard however argue that Roilsard county is the historic location of the capital, and if we are truly to be the successors to Roilsard we should stick with tradition."
 flavor_roilsard.2.a:0 "Saloren shall be the new capital!"
 flavor_roilsard.2.b:0 "We should not break tradition."

 flavor_roilsard.3.t:0 "The Sack of Deranne"
 flavor_roilsard.3.d:0 "Deranne lies in ashes. It is rare for an army to be given unilateral permission to loot and destroy, and our soldiers took full advantage of this boon, unrelenting in their destruction seeking to avenge the wrongs of the past. This day shall not be soon forgotten."
 flavor_roilsard.3.a:0 "They should not have abandoned us."

 flavor_roilsard.4.t:0 "The Sack of Lorentainé"
 flavor_roilsard.4.d:0 "Lorentainé, the red city, lies in ashes, the entire city set ablaze. Whether this was a careless mistake or a deliberate act of justice is not clear; and we do not care, the Lorentish brought this wrath upon themselves. Even now we have begun to send the last of the objects of value back to Roilsard where they will be displayed prominently as a warning to others."
 flavor_roilsard.4.a:0 "We will shatter then"

 flavor_roilsard.5.t:0 "Pressing Our Demands"
 flavor_roilsard.5.d:0 "The Emperor has refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of our claim to the electorship for the West Dameshead, however now that we control the imperial capital of Anbenncóst they will be forced to recognise our claim."

 flavor_roilsard.6.t:0 "The Roilsardi Demands"
 flavor_roilsard.6.d:0 "Previously we rejected the Roilsard demands for an Electorship due to their dubious claims, however they have occupied Anbenncóst and forced their way into the imperial capital, demanding we recognize their electorship and grant them rights normally reserved for a king."
 flavor_roilsard.6.a:0 "We have no choice but to comply."
 flavor_roilsard.6.b:0 "They cannot be allowed to do as they please."

 flavor_roilsard.7.t:0 "The Emperor's Response"
 flavor_roilsard.7.d:0 "The Emperor has accepted our demands, we are to be recognized as the elector for the West Dameshead."
 flavor_roilsard.7.a:0 "Good."

 flavor_roilsard.8.t:0 "The Emperor's Response"
 flavor_roilsard.8.d:0 "Amazingly, the Emperor has rejected our demands and denounced us, citing our use of force as a break of imperial rules. However, the incident has greatly hurt their reputation and some are beginning to question their position as emperor as a result."
 flavor_roilsard.8.a:0 "We will not forget this insult."

 flavor_roilsard.9.t:0 "Roilsard Offers Protection"
 flavor_roilsard.9.d:0 "Due to our shared heritage and their prominence within the empire the Roilsardi branch has offered re-unification and representation without their assembly, provided we swear fealty to them of course."

 flavor_roilsard.12.t:0 "Elections!"
 flavor_roilsard.12.d:0 "Today the capital is filled with pageantry as the Roilsardi nobility comes to cast their votes for the next $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$."

 flavor_roilsard.14.t:0 "The Future of Roilsard"
 flavor_roilsard.14.d:0 "There was a time when gathering the four families of Roilsard together would have been a bloodbath. That will not happen today, unified under the thorn crown they have agreed to unite for their common goals, electing a ruler from their ranks."
 flavor_roilsard.14.a:0 "To the Future!"

 flavor_roilsard.15.t:0 "Children of the Thorns"
 flavor_roilsard.15.d:0 "They come back one by one, a trickle that threatens a flood. The people that Roilsard once cast away from here, coming back to Lencenor in search of opportunity, taking advantage of a lapsed exile, a softening situation, an ancestral betrayal forgotten. So far, their efforts to reintegrate into society have met with varying degrees of success.\n\nThe most successful, however – the strongest and the most vicious in the refugees’ number – have formed mercenary companies, selling their blood for treasure and acceptance. If we dare, we can gather these soldiers of fortune into a company loosely tied to our interests. They are rough, ill-disciplined, most have a chip on their shoulders. But, as the saying goes, even a rose has thorns – perhaps that should be the name of their company?"
 flavor_roilsard.15.a:0 "Why dither? Let’s give our stray-sons something to do!"

 flavor_roilsard.16.t:0 "The Lizards of Teramzadai"
 flavor_roilsard.16.d:0 "A strange delegation has arrived in our settlement’s administration here in Teramzarai. The lizardfolk had long traded with the halflings of Fahvanosy, and had established an entrepot in the city – now, they seek the same arrangement with us. They demand that we respect them as equals within Roilsard and leverage our technological advantages to maintain and expand the port-city they call home. In exchange, they offer their fealty to us and loyalty to our endeavours."
 flavor_roilsard.16.a:0 "I greet you, fellow (scaly) Roilsardi of Teramzarai!"
 flavor_roilsard.16.b:0 "Kazraiel take you. You are beneath the sole of my boot!"

 flavor_roilsard.17.t:0 "Thorn of the Seas"
 flavor_roilsard.17.d:0 "To gauge Roilsard’s true success, the breadth of our ascendancy, one would have to soar alongside us, many leagues above Halcann. Indeed, it was not clear even to us at first, until money began to flow into our treasury at unheard-of rates, trade and merchandise flooded into Cannor, and our colonies overseas became cities to rival even Anbenncóst in their glory.\n\nUelos’ Lament is now a Roilsardi lake, Aelantir and Sarhal falling under what is often referred to in mercantile parlance as a “thalassocracy” – rule by the sea. Thanks to a combination of colonization, naval expansion, and shrewd trade and diplomacy, Roilsard has truly, finally, become a rose of the seas."
 flavor_roilsard.17.a:0 "Roilsard rules the waves!"

 flavor_roilsard.18.t:0 "Thorns Unshattered"
 flavor_roilsard.18.d:0 "Let the beautiful, terrible thorns\nShield the young growth of my flowers and vegetables.\nLet the sun shine on them all, thorns and plants alike,\nTo prolong this beautiful day.\nSo may Roilsard, the great home of all thorns,\nProsper and forever be glorious!\n\nIf thou, O sower of the thorns,\nWouldst brightly come to me,\nYou should be Emperor, you should be King,\nAnd enjoying thyself without end.\nBe on thy guard against your enemies,\nChoke them out like weeds in my garden.\n\nThe beautiful, terrible thorns,\nSurround that verdant valley——\nWith their seeds in hand,\nTheir sower is like a warrior.\nReturn frequently to me, as a watchman at morning,\nAnd shield me with thy might and power."
 flavor_roilsard.18.a:0 "—From the pen of an unknown Roilsardi propagandist."

 flavor_roilsard.19.t:0 "Imperial Reaffirmation"
 flavor_roilsard.19.d:0 "“[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] of [Root.GetName], stand and receive this Imperial decree:\n\nWe, the Imperial Throne, blessed by the will of Castellos as his Regent on Halann, and in harmony with the wishes of the Princes of the Empire of Anbennar assembled, do hereby issue the following decree:\n\nThe Roilsardi, leal and able subjects of the Empire, are the rightful suzerains of the Western Dameshead. They are the manifestation of Our authority, claim, and command to the frontier of the Empire, and shall be forever more. Thus We have decreed!”"
 flavor_roilsard.19.a:0 "We accept the Imperial decree with gratitude!"

 flavor_roilsard.20.t:0 "United Under the Thorns Grasp"
 flavor_roilsard.20.d:0 "How glorious is our people’s exaltation, as they hail us as the twin rulers of Cannor - Roilsard and our dear brethren of Asheniande, standing together! Through them, with them, we have extended Roilsardi sovereignty over not only Lencenor, but Dostanor, the Folly, and the Borders – asserting ourselves and our culture at the expense of the pathetic, rotting corpses of the old order. Now as a Dual Crown asserts itself and the old ways of the Dove Throne fade away, we have a decision to make regarding the future of Cannor."
 flavor_roilsard.20.a:0 "Asheniande has a right to lands in our control. Let’s hand them over."
 flavor_roilsard.20.b:0 "Exalted be the Dual Crown of Roilsard and Lonnachon!"

 flavor_roilsard.22.t:0 "Lencori Influence"
 flavor_roilsard.22.d:0 "Another province has been influenced by our culture"
 flavor_roilsard.22.a:0 "All under Thorns"
 flavor_roilsard.22.a:0 "All under Thorns, but don´t show me this again"

 flavor_roilsard.23.t:0 "Roilsard Offers Protection"
 flavor_roilsard.23.d:0 "Our Roilsardi ally offers us protection in exchange of our loyalty."
 flavor_roilsard.23.a:0 "Sure"
 flavor_roilsard.23.b:0 "Never"
