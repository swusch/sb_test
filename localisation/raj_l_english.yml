 #decisions
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_agriculture_title:0 "Reform the Ministry of Agriculture"
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_agriculture_desc:0 "The Ministry of Agriculture manages Rahen's fertile fields and flocks of livestock. In recent years, however, its staff have neglected to do their jobs. We must restore Rahen's damaged infrastructural networks and appease the farmers and labourers upon whose produce the Ministry depends. With their assent, we will be able to conduct a conclusive administrative overhaul and reform the Ministry of Agriculture."
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_philosophy_title:0 "Reform the Ministry of Philosophy"
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_philosophy_desc:0 "The Ministry of Philosophy is in charge of the moral and judicial manners of the Raj, it keeps checks on corruption and administers the education of new ministers. That is how it is supposed to work at least. This most august of government bodies has itself become the most corrupt of them all. In order to change this we must lead by example. Engage in religious debate, crack down on corruption and build a case to show the ministers the right way forward. Only if they are enlightened once more can we reform the Ministry of Philosophy."
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_internal_relations_title:0 "Reform the Ministry of Internal Relations"
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_internal_relations_desc:0 "The Ministry of Internal Relations keeps the various Prahhia and Senaptia of the Raj quiescent, and allows Rahen to act as one unified entity, with one voice and one mind. However, the Ministry has become decadent, and our sovereignty and supremacy within the Raj is no longer as respected as it once was. This must change. By ensuring that our subjects do not fight one another, and by quashing any and all rebellions that arise, we will restore our legitimacy and in so doing free ourselves to reform the Ministry of Internal Relations."
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_foreign_relations_title:0 "Reform the Ministry of Foreign Relations"
 rahen_reform_ministry_of_foreign_relations_desc:0 "The Ministry of Foreign Relations, eponymously, oversees the Raj's relationships with the outside world. However, its functions have atrophied. To do something about this, we will have to act on our own initiative to raise our prestige and assume a commanding position in foreign affairs. Victory in war - particularly against the hobgoblins - will also provide us with the necessary political capital to reform the Ministry of Foreign Relations."

 rahen_fix_infrastructure_title:0 "Fix Infrastructure"
 rahen_fix_infrastructure_desc:0 "Due to the ministries' neglect the infrastructure around the Raj has been decaying. As Raja we only have one direct tool: The army. Let us direct our forces and put them to work on something that might not be prestigious, but is absolutely heroic, repairing the roads, canals and irrigation systems of Rahen."
 rahen_investigate_ministry_estates_title:0 "Investigate Local Ministries"
 rahen_investigate_ministry_estates_desc:0 "The ministers over the past decades have ammassed large quantities of personal wealth, many have siphoned off government funds to build themselves lavish mansions and palaces. Let us investigate these to search for documents or other evidence of this corruption."

 rahen_open_up_senapti_ranks_title:0 "£icon_raj_cohesion_s£ §cOpen up Senapti ranks§!"

The force that led Rahen to harmony, drowned in chaos.\n\nThe Harimraj was broken. But now [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits on the Lotus Throne, and the realm shall be renewed at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. Recall the ministries, anoint the senapti, elect a vizier.

 rahen_confirm_decentralization_desc:0 "The Raj is not a solitary monolith, standing strong by itself; it comprises a multitude of realms, and this diversity is the source of our strength. An Elephant walks with its herd, not alone. Let us embrace this tradition by empowering the local ministries under the supervision of our Prabhia and Senaptia. This will make our subjects richer, and in turn, able to field more men to fight for us."

 rahen.5.t:0 "Guru Suhan and the Hall of Endless Debate"
 rahen.5.d:0 "It has been said that The Hall of Endless Debate welcomes all voices and opinions, and many have made their way to this great center of learning to offer unorthodox or unconventional ideas. One such recent arrival is a gaunt, bright-eyed Harimari named Suhan.\n\nSuhan quickly differentiated himself from the many other voices at the Hall with his exceptional eloquence and unusual rhetorical style. His unassuming words, tinged with a slight Yan accent, always seem to carry two levels of meaning, simultaneously humorous and sharply perceptive. "Guru Suhan'', as his followers call him, has rapidly risen into prominence among the Debate Masters of Rayavhashapal, and has begun to verbally spar with some of the greatest thinkers in the city.\n\nIn his confrontations with the masters,Suhan has shown himself to be more than just a masterful speaker, however, but a singularly genius philosopher. His doctrine, a personal creation that he refers to simply as 'The Praxis', is as unique as his rhetorical style. Suhan's Praxis holds principles derived from all of the other major philosophies but seems equally critical of each philosophy by itself. He admires the Orange Sash for their love of family while decrying the way they exclude women and foreigners from their halls; he argues as strongly for the Starry Eye's pursuit of knowledge as he argues against their 'isolationist ivory-tower' outlook; and in one breath he can sing the praises of the Golden Palace's excellent administration while declaiming their hatred for those who do not abide the structure they impose.\n\nSuhan's knowledge of all seven major schools of philosophy has made him difficult to best in debate, and his brief time in Rayavhashapal has sent shockwaves through the academic community. He recently departed the Hall, sweeping out as suddenly as he had arrived, heading into the countryside - supposedly to teach philosophy to the lower castes! Where he is heading next we do not know for sure - but it seems unlikely that this Suhan and his Praxis will do anything but gain followers in the coming years."
 rahen.5.a:0 "Hyperbole has no place in philosophy."
 rahen.6.t:0 "The Suhanic Reformation"
 rahen.6.d:0 "It has been several years since Guru Suhan departed the Hall of Endless Debate to bring his teachings into the countryside, and in that time his legend has only grown. Despite the efforts of various philosophers and lords, the Guru has avoided any who would hamper his progress and has accumulated a following of thousands across all castes and races. Suhan’s influence is strongest in the western hills of Rakhadesh and Rayavashapal, the impression he made at the Hall of Endless Debate continuing to echo in the rhetoric that emerges from its many vaulted lecture halls.\n\nNow, the Guru’s disciples include even prabhia and grand ministers, and the breadth and heft of his movement has grown to the point that it rolls ever forward under its own weight. Itinerant apostles of the Guru bring his message further and further afield, students study his style and ideas, and agitators rally to the ideas of social change that he advocates. Most importantly, most members of the movement now see it as a religion apart from mainline High Philosophy, and have adopted a far more aggressive stance toward proselytism than is traditional in Rahen. The ground shakes beneath the weight of this religious reformation, and none can yet say how it will change the world."
 rahen.6.a:0 "Like an earthquake, our foundations shall crumble and be built anew."
 rahen.7.t:0 "Suhan Travels to [Root.GetName]"
 rahen.7.d:0 "Originally teaching in the western interior of Rahen, Suhan’s entourage has departed from the dusty drylands bordering the Marutha and found its way downriver to the coastal cities of Sramaya and the Raghamideshi coast.\n\nWith this mob of religious zealots and preachers comes a fever of fervor that will strike the population of these lands like a thunderbolt, and set rolling the great avalanche of religious strife and conflict between those who believe and those who cling to their traditional ways. For his part, the Guru seems convinced of his mission, despite the danger that comes from operating among so many who might want his death, and shows no intention of turning from the path of spreading his message to all who will hear."
 rahen.7.a:0 "He walks a dangerous path."
 rahen.8.d:0 " Departing from the monsoon-drenched coasts, the Guru Suhan has traveled inland up the Kharunyana, bringing his reformation with him. In the porcelain cities of the River-Sea, the savannahs of the Elephant Lords, and even on the slopes of Mount Tughayasa, missives are received and voices ring out in support for the Guru and his message of change. Already he has drawn great crowds who clamor to hear the words of the great teacher, and the ranks of his supporters swell by the day."
 rahen.8.a:0 " He seeks succor in the wilderness."
 rahen.9.d:0 "While Rahen was the cradle of High Philosophy and its religious schools, it is far from the only place that the High Gods’ followers are found. Across the Kharunyana, the Bom Fortress-cities long ago turned from their indigenous faiths and converted to High Philosophy – and now, perhaps, they will turn to another religion still, for Guru Suhan has crossed the Kharunyana from Dhujat and brought his entourage beyond the borders of the Harimraj to teach. The aging philosopher’s message continues to spread, his apostles continuing his labors in the lands he has left."
 rahen.9.a:0 "Will his labors ever end?"
 rahen.10.t:0 "The Death of Guru Suhan"
 rahen.10.d:0 "All men die. Impermanence is one of the great truths of life, and no one – be they mage or saint or king – can outrun death forever. Age takes us, disease finds us, violence visits us, and one by one, we die.\n\nToday, one of the many who died is an old man who spent his life in travel and philosophy. The Guru Suhan – teacher and preacher, reformer and advocate for the oppressed and downtrodden – passed away peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by his loyal supporters and disciples. In his time, Suhan changed the world with his ideas and his unflinching spirit, bringing a message of change and hope to countless souls and giving purpose to the lives of millions. But all men die, and Suhan has walked to the end of his path.\n\nFrom here, he steps off of the Nitikamarja, and into Purtara with the High Gods. Those who yet live are deprived of their leader, of the great reformer whose spiritual earthquake rocked Rahen, and with him goes the unity of his followers and their movement. Whatever follows, the faithful must walk the Nitikamarja alone now, and contend with those who deny Suhan’s message without his guiding hand."
 rahen.10.a:0 "All Rahen shall feel his loss, enemy or friend."
 rahen.11.t:0 "The Execution of Guru Suhan"
 rahen.11.d:0 "Power hates a mirror. Those who lift the glass of reflection into the face of the mighty risk much, for there is little more despised by despots and tyrants than revealing what they are. The corrupt, exploitative, and monstrous can only be brought down by those they oppress when their true nature is revealed to the masses, and so those who strive to show truth to the people are often hunted by those who support the structures of rule.\n\nOn this day, one such lightbringer has been snuffed out. Hounded by his many enemies, betrayed by false friends, the Guru Suhan – teacher and preacher, reformer and advocate for the oppressed and downtrodden – was captured at his headquarters and unceremoniously executed by agents of those who saw his challenge of religion and government as a threat to their authority.\n\nThis violent end for the reformer who sought to change the world with words will no doubt reverberate across Rahen, snuffing some of the fires of reformation that raged while igniting fury deep in the souls of the most devout. Whichever follows, the source of the spiritual earthquake that has rocked Rahen is dead, and with him goes the unity of his followers and their movement."
 rahen.11.a:0 "Thus ends the liberation of thought and spirit."
 rahen.12.t:0 "The Praxis Triumphant"
 rahen.12.d:0 "When he was but a boy, Guru Suhan traveled across Yanshen and observed many peoples and beliefs, noting that although they were all different, there was wisdom to be found in all places and peoples. As he became older, Suhan saw that beyond the disagreements that philosophers often stagnated on, many held a great deal in common, and harmony among such men was a matter of showing folk how they were more similar than different. Suhan’s belief that there was wisdom in all places, and that most people could be united if directed onto a path that emphasized their similarities instead of accentuating their differences, eventually became the core of his Praxis.\n\nAnd what has that Praxis become? Where once the learned fought over who was right, now they speak of how to become more correct, closer to truth. Where once there were systems of injustice, now there is measured reform. Where once there were myriad schools of philosophy, now there is one Synthetic Truth. From the Paravimvata to the Kharunyana and beyond, the Praxis has united people regardless of language, culture, or caste, and offers a new day – an observant day, a moderated day, a considered and thoughtful and ever-evolving, ever-learning day – for all."
 rahen.12.a:0 "The eightfold sun rises over Rahen."
 rahen.13.t:0 "Suhanic Fervor"
 rahen.13.d:0 "The teachings of Guru Suhan have spread across [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] like wildfire, swiftly becoming the religion of the masses. While such a thing could be ignored as just a fad in another situation, many of our ministers have expressed support for Suhan’s teachings, with some even openly chanting Praxis mantras in court. It will be impossible to remain neutral in the growing sectarian divide currently splitting Rahen in two – we will have to pick a side."
 rahen.13.a:0 "The way forward is clear. Guru Suhan shall guide us well."
 rahen.13.b:0 "The wisdom of one man is insufficient to sculpt a religion."
 rahen.14.t:0 "Dwarves Return to the Mountain"
 rahen.14.d:0 "With the reclamation of the Tree of Stone by the Dwarves of [rahen_exodus_target_2.GetName] well underway, a large number of Dwarves living in our lands have decided to leave and join their brethren in their reclamation. They come now before our [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] seeking their blessing in this endeavour. While their departure would be great loss to our nation, who are we to deny their return to their ancestral homeland?"
 rahen.14.a:0 "We wish them well in their mission!"
 rahen.14.b:0 "Stop them, this is their home now!"
 rahen.15.t:0 "Raheni Dwarves Return Home!"
 rahen.15.d:0 "Our reclamation of the Tree of Stone has not gone unnoticed, and our brethren in Rahen have begun migrating back to the mountains from [rahen_exodus_target_3.GetName], seeking to join in the reclamation! It is clear now that it is our destiny to retake the mountains, and with their return, we are one step closer to that goal!"
 rahen.15.a:0 "Let them settle in [rahen_exodus_target_1.GetName]!"
 rahen.16.t:0 "Indrana Lalikesh Vinashkar"
 rahen.16.d:0 "In a field full of high caste individuals, Indrana Lalikesh Vinashkar proved that arts were accessible to everyone, even for middle caste people like himself. Born in Pordhatti, the child proved himself a prodigy who quickly attracted local patronage. By the age of 11, he was already a master of the paintbrush and was sent to Khiraspid to learn all that could be taught of matters of ink and brush, studying under the master painters of the time. His works were brilliant yet unconventional, focused on the contrast of light and shadow on landscape and face, and sharply contrasted with the regimented stylization of the time. Though his controversial departures from established norms saw him condemned by many leading artists of the time, I.L. Vinashkar’s works revolutionized the way that people across Haless thought about painting. His “Alachaya” style inspired countless artists up and down the Kharunyana river in the decades after his death in 1539, when the great artist was given a state funeral by the Good Raja Hemantsen and Rani Jira."
 rahen.16.a:0 "He will be a fine addition to our court"
 rahen.17.t:0 "The Jungle Paradise"
 rahen.17.d:0 "‘Masters, anxious. Slaves, restless. The corruption of the harimraj has taken its toll on the daily lives of the peoples of Rahen. Broken roads, filth and squalor, - these garnish the once splendid cities along the Dhenbasana. The Raja is uncaring, lulled by the sweet words spoken by his courtiers inside the glamor of his golden palace. Senapti and prabhi, tasked with serving the Raja, instead bleed themselves as they fight for power and influence.\n\nThis was not how the world was meant to be.\n\nHarimari, children of the Great One, once leaders of our society, once proud and righteous striding along the Nitikamarja - how stand you now? Sidelined by manipulative and shortsighted humans, lured into complacency and sloth. Our soldiers, mighty as they marched from the deserts of Azka-Sur to the coastline of Tianlou, now mere tools meekly following their petty lords’ whim. Our empire, the greatest to ever grace the earth, as envisioned by Harimar himself, now a fleeting imagination. There once was a dream of a paradise. Where have those gone who would realize it?’\n\n - Excerpt from ‘Maharaj Vanrahar’ or the ’Jungle Paradise’"
 rahen.17.a:0 "It is our destiny to make this dream come true"
 rahen.17.b:0 "May the glory of Vanrahar live on forever"
 rahen.18.t:0 "Made in Sarisung"
 rahen.18.d:0 "Porcelain makers along the Kharunyana have been hit by a downturn in sales in the last few years. Instability in the Raj and the looming threat of hobgoblins from the north greatly reduced demands in the high quality porcelains that they made, but they have lately faced another threat from upstream. The porcelain production facilities in Sarisung were not exactly known for their quality, but their size more than made up for it in quantity. Though of lower quality than true hard paste porcelains, the lower pricing demanded by the sarisung guilds has been more affordable to households with lower incomes to purchase, expanding the market but dropping prices. With gangs and cartels running that city, our own porcelain producers have been asking to stop the entry of Sarisung products in our market."
 rahen.18.a:0 "Cheap stuff doesn't have a place in our country!"
 rahen.18.b:0 "Unfortunately, the market and the consumers decide everything"
 rahen.19.t:0 "First Contact"
 rahen.19.d:0 "Journal Entry, 43:\n\n‘This has been a long and adventurous day. Last night, our ship was attacked by a group of pirates. The alcohol must have done quite a number on me because I could've sworn that they have wings growing out of their backs. My crewmates have told me that I’m a lunatic, and it may well be true because two nights ago I saw a glowing light in the shape of a giant whale while passing the Ringlet Sea.\n\nOur supplies were dwindling since our last stop. If we didn’t make land in the next couple of days, we might as well join the creature of my imagination in this cursed sea. As if the Dame herself heard my plea, we saw ports filled with ships of various makes, carrying goods in and out of the harbor. Beyond them, we saw a city with many distinctive structures, chief among them a massive and intimidating tower, piercing towards the sky.\n\nWe landed at an outlying dock, towed into port by a series of small ships and pilots guiding our vessel along the open channels of the harbor. Greeted by one of the dockworkers speaking in a language we didn’t understand, we were  finally able to communicate when we learned that they can speak sparsely in Bulwari. While we were trying to learn more about this area, the harbormaster finally came, and what we saw was beyond our imagination. A tall creature, with striped body and feline head, clad in fine silks and wearing ringlets of brass and gold. This is a harimari, and this was Rahen, the mysterious land from Jaher’s stories.’"
 rahen.19.a:0 "This was the end of our jouney, and the start of a new one"
 rahen.20.t:0 "Cannorians on the Kharunyana"
 rahen.20.d:0 "The arrival of Cannorians into Rahen has been a huge boon to our industry and trade. With increasing demands for Raheni goods like porcelain and spices, silver bullion has flooded our ports, and the merchants have grown fat on the riches of the trade. The Cannorians, longstanding trade partners now interested in further trading opportunities, have started to ask for a more permanent residence inside our cities to facilitate greater volumes of trade. This idea has met some pushback from some of our more suspicious advisors, as they fear that the foreigners may bring an unforeseen damage to our country - They have been described as brash and ignorant of the long history and customs of the local populance. On the other hand, the Cannorian have different technologies and knowledge that we can learn from. They may be eager to trade that knowledge with us if we let them have their quarters inside our city."
 rahen.20.a:0 "We will not let them inside our city walls!"
 rahen.20.b:0 "Let us begin the next chapter of our relationship"
 rahen.21.t:0 "Porcelain Espionage"
 rahen.21.desc:0 "Torches lit up the night sky in the city. People started flocking into the town square. A criminal has been apprehended trying to sneak into the porcelain production shop - a Cannorian The greatest fear of the guildmasters - that our guests who attempt to make off with the secrets to porcelain making -has been realized. As news spread, the crowd only grew in size and rowdiness until finally a city magistrate arrived on the scene. The crowd writhed with citizens calling for punishment - for the spy to be put to death, for the Cannorians to be expelled entirely from the city. A decision needed to be made."

For many, a visit to the ziggurat is just the start of a religious journey, an ancient tradition of pilgrimage between the two holy sites of Tiltaghar and Tilathi. With its magnificence and importance, the ziggurat demanded great care and maintenance from those ruling its land. While there are visitors aplenty to be taxed, it’s expected for the lord to maintain the site in reverence to the High Gods."

Many pilgrims finished their journey from Tiltaghar here, while others traveled from the south to start their own discoveries of the wisdom of the High Gods. Despite its splendor, the silver ziggurat is old, and necessitates preservation for it to shine long into the future. With many travelers in the city, we can ask for their generous donation for the upkeep of the site."

 rahen.24.d:0 "The two ziggurats stood tall as a great deal of pilgrims started their journey from one of the sites to the other. While the structures were not built by the High Gods themselves, the ziggurats, the oldest structures built by mortal hands that yet stand along the banks of the Kharunyana, have become symbols of the wisdom of the gods and the path they have laid for us. Some also say that the twin pyramids are a depiction of the people of Rahen, with the Tiger Ziggurat symbolizing the Harimari while the Elephant represents the humans, their coexistence a testament to the strong bonds that connect the races of Rahen. Ever since both of these sites became parts of our territories, trades and pilgrimage in the area has been flourishing. Many merchants have been selling goods to help facilitate the pilgrim’s journey while both cities bustle with travelers from all over Haless. The fruit of our labors to create a safe passage between the two sites is ripe, and with the great pilgrimage on the horizon, it is ready to be harvested"

Some newly-purchased by a successful merchant, others dating back to before Ramapalar’s reunification.\n\nAnd all too many are sadly unfinished. Perhaps an engineer died to a flash flood, taking with him key information. Perhaps a benefactor was convinced in the Hall of Endless Debate to devote his funds to another purpose. Perhaps the builders and their patron were all lost to the Smothering Sickness, like so many in Rahen.\n\nBut today, in [Root.GetName], one such palace was finished. Long after most had given up on it, it now is a glittering monument to glory, something to rival the Golden Palace itself.\n\nA blond-haired Copper Dwarf, hailing from the faraway Hold of Ovdal Tungr, stumbled upon plans drawn up by since-departed masters of their craft. And with a keen eye and unflagging spirit, he set to work. From laying bricks to emplacing ornate decorations, slowly that ancient vision became reality.\n\nAll hope seemed lost he when he grew ill, and left for treatment with herbal tonics that could only be found in Parusad Bhola. But a Harimari — unique for dying his coat green, and for his unmatched strength — took up the torch with a spirit and fervor to rival the dwarf’s own.\n\nThe palace rose, and rose, and rose. With a little help in its final decoration from a human mage new to the region, the palace became a veritable work of art, standing above and beyond its brethren. And so the dream of so many, over so many years, has finally been realized."

I tremble to think of it--not from fear, but from the impossible warmth that fills me from chest to fingertip whenever I read his letters, or see his smile beneath that ridiculous turban the portrait-artist insisted he wear to “seem wise.” He is wise (more than wise!) but also kind, and funny, and he loves the stars as I do.\n\nOh diary, what is a bride to do?

 rahen.103.d:0 "The camps around the Iron Palace are now streets. The forge-fires are joined by lanterns and schools.

It is not the dainty marble of elven kings nor the painted lacquer of Harimari halls. It is brutal. Beautiful. Eternal."

Beneath your feet lie the bones of kingdoms, ground to gravel. From this citadel, no storm can uproot you. The revels stretch for three nights: peacock-dancers in chainmail-silk, ale from the cellars of Hul-az-Krakazol, and the chant of loyalists who know no other god than you. You sit upon your perfection... and dream of more."

But in one way they are an outsider: they follow a different interpretation of High Philosophy than that of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap].\n\nThat difference has been thrown into stark relief with recent developments: apparently, they've been teaching their interpretation to various courtiers, with some level of popularity! Should the Raja let this stand?"
 rahenraj.2122.a:0 "They may do as they please"
 rahenraj.2122.b:0 "That is not their role at court!"
 rahenraj.2123.t:0 "Offering the Vizier a Wife"
 rahenraj.2123.d:0 "There are many rumors that surround the fact our vizier lacks a wife: some speak of past scandal, others of a tragic widowhood, yet others say he is inspired by the eunuchs' administrative capabilities. It would not normally be worthy of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s dignity to spare such a fact even a passing thought, let alone involve [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in such affairs, except... one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] daughters has recently come of age, with no engagement yet planned.\n\nPerhaps we should propose a marriage to the vizier, and bind their loyalty by ties of blood?"
 rahenraj.2123.a:0 "Fetch my daughter, and fetch the vizier, and fetch a marriage contract!"
 rahenraj.2123.b:0 "Nonsense!"
 rahenraj.2124.t:0 "The Raja Offers us a Wife"
 rahenraj.2124.d:0 "When [Root.Monarch.GetName] was summoned urgently to the Raja, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feared the worst -- an imminent invasion? A plague in the jungles? A discovery in the high temples?\n\nBut as soon as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] arrived at the throne, with a female figure bedecked in jewels and silks at the Raja's side, it was clear something entirely different was afoot. The Raja immediately introduced [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] daughter, and proposed that the vizier take her as his wife."
 rahenraj.2124.a:0 "I am honoured... what's this about a dowry?"
 rahenraj.2124.b:0 "Matchmaker is not a good role for the Raja"

 rahenraj.5001.t:0 "[GotRaja]"
 rahenraj.5001.t1:0 "The Raja is Captured!"
 rahenraj.5001.t2:0 "The Raja Escapes!"
 rahenraj.5001.d1:0 "Some Rajas die in triumph: Ramapalar the Reunifier died peacefully in the Golden Palace, atop a realm he had reforged. Others die in tragedy: The Raja Amapurna II fell to the smothering sickness, that foul plague which did not distinguish between the highest lord and the lowliest peasant. Only time will tell how historians describe the end of Raja [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetName] -- but make no doubt, today marks [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] end.\n\nOur forces dragged [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] out of the castle he had been hiding in, and by the time [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] was presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName], [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] silks were torn and muddied. Finally, [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] outside appearance matched [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] aptitude for rule.\n\nThere was rage, and anger, and disgust. But Harimar himself was not the first Harimari, merely the first to conquer and unite them, and so too has [Root.Monarch.GetName] proven himself the rightful Raja.\n\nUltimately, [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetName] was made to recognize that. And that shall be the last the historians write of [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim], as they shift their attention to a more worthy dynasty: ours."
 rahenraj.5001.d2:0 "The Dhenbasana is littered with palaces, funded by embezzled taxes and tariffs as well as withheld tributes, bribes to look past such crimes, or (in rare cases) genuine success and wise rule. No two are identical, but almost all share one feature: a well-concealed escape route.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is reminded of this fact as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hears today’s report from a messenger dressed in a strange red and white hat. Our forces were victorious and the [4411.Owner.Country.GetAdjective] palace quickly seized, but the Raja [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] escaped like smoke on the wind. “Apologies, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]”, he concludes, “But your Raja is in another palace.”\n\nNo matter. Haless could not outrun Harimar, the stream cannot outrace the sea. Run as [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] likes, we will soon capture the Raja, and with [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim], the Lotus Throne."
 rahenraj.5001.d3:0 "The Dhenbasana is littered with palaces, funded by embezzled taxes and tariffs as well as withheld tributes, bribes to look past such crimes, or (in rare cases) genuine success and wise rule. No two are identical, but almost all share one feature: a well-concealed escape route.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is reminded of this fact as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hears today’s report from a messenger dressed in a strange red and white hat. Our enemy's enemy managed to siege down the fortress where the Raja had holed [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in, but [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] escaped like smoke on the wind. “[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]”, he concludes, “the Raja has found refuge in another palace.”\n\nGood. Haless could not outrun Harimar, the stream cannot outrace the sea. Run as [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] likes, we will soon capture the Raja, and with [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim], the Lotus Throne."
 rahenraj.5001.d4:0 "Bittersweet news arrived today from our spies in [raja_castle_not_ours.GetName]. The Raja, that matted fur, got [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] captured by somebody other than us! A foreigner, at that!\n\nWhile we'll shed no tear for [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetName], the impossibility of using the Raja as a hostage means we'll need to occupy all of [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] land for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s' claim on the Lotus throne to be recognized as legitimate."
 rahenraj.5001.a:0 "The Lotus Throne and the Harimraj is ours!"
 rahenraj.5001.b:0 "Our forces march on!"
 rahenraj.5001.c:0 "Damnation!"
 others_got_raja_tt:0 "Others captured the Raja, only full occupation of [4411.Owner.GetName] will be enough to legitimize our claim now."
 rahenraj.5002.t:0 "Our Cause Is Doomed"
 rahenraj.5002.d:0 "Our plan was excellent: a secret alliance with a few well-placed senapti, the backing of key figures in the ministry, enough popular support to drown out public outcry. But no plan survives contact with the enemy, and it seems the support for our cause has faltered.\n\nTime can wear down mountains and rust sharp metal to dust. It is therefore unsurprising that as the years of this internecine conflict wore on, our allies were overwhelmed by doubt, the ministries eliminated our supporters in quiet reorganizations, and the public grew outraged at our insult to the ‘rightful’ raja. We cannot continue in this cause without dooming the entire Harimraj. We are done.\n\nOne day, [Root.Monarch.GetName] swears, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] or [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] descendants will sit upon the Lotus Throne. But it shall not be today."
 rahenraj.5002.a:0 "Vachava teaches us of the virtue of haste, a virtue we sorely lacked."
 rahenraj.5003.t:0 "An Elevation to Senapti"
 rahenraj.5003.d:0 "The troops were spotted a long way outside of [Root.Capital.GetName], their armor and spears polished to a bright shine in the noonday sun. For a moment, guards feared [Root.GetName] might be under attack, until they realized the banner the company carried was raja [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s own. They were quickly ushered to an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nIn the Jungles of Ascension, Harimari proved their strength with red tooth and sharp claw. We may have used other methods, but this delegation made clear we have proven our strength just as well. The Raja has taken notice of our recent successes, and in a scroll written in elegant calligraphy, [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] proclaims our reward: we have been elevated to the rank of senapti."
 rahenraj.5003.a:0 "We will serve well as sword and shield, and grow stronger yet."

 rahenraj.5005.t:0 "A Mandate on Logistics"
 rahenraj.5005.d:0 "Prabhia talk about tactics, senaptia think about strategy, but viziers study logistics. And it seems the vizier has been studying hard.\n\nThat, at least, is what [Root.Monarch.GetName] concludes after reading the latest missive distributed by the ministries on the vizier’s behalf. A series of reorganizations and directions, each subtle, but each strengthening the systems that support the Harimraj’s military forces. "As a paw supports a shield, the realm must support our armies", the vizier concludes. And with those words, every state that swears loyalty to the Lotus Throne moves to do just that."
 rahenraj.5005.a:0 "The realm shall be mustered for war!"
 rahenraj.5005.b:0 "Prepare our forces, and ready them to march."
 rahenraj.5005.c:0 "It seems our best have been conscripted to serve…"
 rahenraj.5006.t:0 "A Mandate of Recruitment"
 rahenraj.5006.d:0 "Far from bustling [Root.Capital.GetName], there lies a small village, visited today by a small and unarmed Harimari. The farmers there are busy tending to their crops, but even so, they could easily tear the interloper apart. And they might well have, given what he asked of them, if not for the fact that the visitor bore a mandate bearing the vizier’s own seal.\n\nSuch is the reaction when you are told your husbands’ and sons’ kartya now leads them to battle. That they may not return for years. That the most you could do for them would be praying fiercely to Anjita the Warrior.\n\nThe same scene repeats itself across the Harimraj, for the vizier has mustered the realm for war."
 rahenraj.5006.a:0 "Bolster our forces with the best!"
 rahenraj.5006.b:0 "The best we will recruit, the rest we will find another use for."
 rahenraj.5006.c:0 "Mothers, do not cry, you shall have time aplenty for mourning."
 rahenraj.5007.t:0 "Mandated Imperial Drills"
 rahenraj.5007.d:0 "Some say war is an art, and not a science. Such fools have obviously never studied the four-volume ‘On the Proper Practice of War’, the crowning achievement of one of Indrayanar’s least-favourite ministers.\n\nVolume Two focuses on the fifty formations every soldier should be able to execute. It is also the source for much of the vizier’s latest mandate, which outlines a strict regimen of drills that every soldier in the Harimraj is expected to follow. One of your generals snorts at the idea of letting the Ministries dictate the practice of war, but even he knows the wisdom of choosing your battles — when the vizier drums a beat, all the Harimraj must follow."
 rahenraj.5007.a:0 "This should be suitable training for our officers."
 rahenraj.5007.b:0 "Let us make true Harimari out of our troops."
 rahenraj.5007.c:0 "Our soldiers shall grow even closer to their kartya."
 rahenraj.5007.tt:0 "The following modifier will be lost should we find ourself embroiled in a new war."
 rahenraj.5008.t:0 "The Raja Mandate Imperial Tribute"
 rahenraj.5008.d:0 "If Tamatma is the soul of the Harimraj, coin is its lifeblood. Each day the engine of trade carries pecuniary wealth down the great rivers that are Rahen’s veins and arteries, paying for porcelain and palaces and plenty of soldiers to guard the same.\n\nWith the vizier’s latest edict, it seems that flow will be diverted to the Lotus Throne, and from there sent to irrigate the armouries and recruitment centers of the realm. A veritable legion of tariff collectors fan out across the Harimraj, each an engineer to ensure the flow is diverted as the ministries see fit. And soon, the strange alchemy transforming the treasury’s gold and silver into the soldiers’ flesh and steel will begin."
 rahenraj.5008.a:0 "The soldiers will report first to Red Turban, Minister of War"
 rahenraj.5008.b:0 "Run for your life!"
 rahenraj.5009.t:0 "The Raja Demands Harmony"
 rahenraj.5009.d:0 "Harimar brought harmony to Rahen with red tooth and sharp claw. The Edict of Sardiphadin brought harmony to Rahen with a clear delineation of each person’s kartya. But the raja? To bring harmony to Rahen, all the raja needs are a few stern words, and some carefully worded notes distributed to palaces across the realm."
 rahenraj.5009.a:0 "We may want to follow their words with our own…"
 rahenraj.5009.b:0 "Let us reflect on our kartya."
 rahenraj.5009.c:0 "Let all reflect on their kartya!"
 rahenraj.5009.tt:0 "The modifier will be lost if we go to war against another member of the §PRaj§!."

 rahenraj.5010.t:0 "Expand the War Against the Raj"
 rahenraj.5010.d:0 "It is said that the ministries have a dedicated form that tracks and proscribes the movement of any soldier anywhere in the Harimraj. Perhaps this is why their forces will crumble against ours, because the armies we have mustered against our foe know no such restriction.\n\nThe exigencies of waging war have led to some disputes recently, where our armies have accidentally ranged into prabhi not involved in our war efforts. Their diplomatic delegation to [Root.Capital.GetName] takes great offence at these transgressions… but our generals see it as an opportunity. They are not our intended target, no, but perhaps they should be. A calculated insult to their diplomats should draw them into this conflict, and thus add to our spoils."
 rahenraj.5010.a:0 "Another petty prabhi to crush, how delightful."
 rahenraj.5010.b:0 "Even the tiger knows to devour prey in many small bites."

 rahenraj.0.t:0 "The Decadence of the Harimraj"
 rahenraj.0.d:0 "Since the reign of Golpalar I, the bureaucracy of the Harimraj has been growing more and more powerful and corrupt. A series of weak rulers, civil wars, and plagues have decimated the power and authority of the Raja. Now, 50 years of poor management of what was once the greatest empire in Haless has come to a head. The elderly Raja Indranayar has little control over his state - his feuding subjects war with one another to consolidate their power, the ministerial bureaucrats embezzle money and land while abdicating their responsibilities, and the army is a fraction of its former size and power.\n\nThe only major asset of the government is the brilliant young Grand Vizier, Manava of the Bloody Claw, Senapti of Rabhidaraj. An administrative genius, Manava’s policies and backroom dealings with powerful ministers have so far kept the government from spiraling into total collapse - but the efforts of one man cannot stave off disaster forever. Dark days loom ahead for the Second Harimraj, and if the court is not heavily reformed, the Raj faces a continual downward spiral until it is ultimately overthrown by one of its many power-hungry subjects. Plans must be laid and preparations swiftly made if the Harimraj is to survive the coming years."
 rahenraj.0.a:0 "We need reform!"
 raj_dhenijansar_colon:0 "Dhenijansar:"

 rahenraj.90.t:0 "The Death of Raja Indranayar the Idle"
 rahenraj.90.d:0 "Indranayar of the Lotus Claw ascended to the throne of the Harimraj at the old age of 61. His unlikely ascension was followed by an equally unlikely long reign - though many expected the elderly Indranayar to die the same year he took the Lotus Throne, the grey-whiskered tiger ruled from Dhenijansar for over twenty years. The Raja was a disinterested ruler who allowed the ministries and Prabhi to self-govern and delegated most matters to his young Vizier Manava of the Bloody Claw. At a time when the Raj needed a firm hand to steer the ship of state, Indranayar instead utterly failed to deal with the vast issues facing the empire.\n\nBut today, Indranayar’s disastrous and ineffectual reign has finally come to an end, and the matter of his successor is upon the lips of every minister and lord in the city. With no children of his own, Indranayar’s presumed heir was his young grand-nephew Indrapalar, but many note that putting a child on the throne would be tantamount to crowning the Grand Vizier as Raja.\n\nAs alternative, two other members of the family have been noted. [R53.Monarch.GetName] the Adventurer is the lord of one of Dhenijansar’s outlying districts, and has great experience in military matters. He has proven himself a capable governor and none could challenge his capacity to rule. Conversely, Ganjina the Peaceflower is the only surviving child of former Raja Amanapurna II. Placing a woman on the throne is highly unorthodox, but Ganjina’s blood claim is strong and she is married to the son of Laxanyar, King of Sarnavan - the alliance that would be formed could be vital for preserving the Lotus Claw dynasty in the coming years.\n\nAs the hours draw late, the ministers and viziers debate the question of succession. Only one will sit the Lotus Throne, but who?"
 rahenraj.90.a:0 "Indrapalar is the rightful heir, and legitimacy still matters, even in times such as these."
 rahenraj.90.b:0 "[R53.Monarch.GetName]'s military expertise is needed to endure this period of crisis."
 rahenraj.90.c:0 "Ganjina is the blood of Amanapurna Peacemaker - she too will bring peace."
 rahenraj.91.t:0 "Continuing Decadence of the Harimraj"
 rahenraj.91.d:0 "The years grind by, and the rusty machinery of the Second Harimraj continues to turn ever more slowly, the signs of administrative corruption clear for all to see. Irrigation canals rot, shipments of grain are sold at massively upmarked prices, and diplomats go unheard at court. Worse still, recent meetings between various important ministers and the staff of the Grand Vizier have been deeply unproductive, and it appears that the efforts of the Vizierate to maintain a working relationship with the corrupt ministries will not be enough to prevent disaster.\n\nAs the philosophers debate the reasons for the empire’s woes and our enemies circle like vultures beyond the borders, the peasantry suffer from the depredations of corrupt landlords and cry out for someone to save them from their hardship."
 rahenraj.91.a:0 "Things are looking bad…"
 rahenraj.92.t:0 "The Death of Manava"
 rahenraj.92.d:0 "Manava of the Bloody Claw, Senapti of Rabhidaraj, First Bannerlord of the Raja and Grand Vizier of the Harimraj, is dead. In his time he was acknowledged as the brightest administrative mind in Rahen, the glue that held the Raj together despite its badly dysfunctional government. A man as ruthless and pragmatic as he was intelligent, Manava’s efforts to preserve the Raj were viewed by his enemies as a selfish power grab that would see the Bloody Claw dynasty sitting the Lotus Throne. Whether his supporters or detractors were correct in the end will never be known, for the genius arresting the Raj’s downward spiral is no more. The fate of the empire is now left to squabbling ministers and selfish lords, and the Lotus Claw dynasty sits a more precarious perch than ever."
 rahenraj.92.a:0 "He walks the path of the High Gods now."
 rahenraj.97.t:0 "The Court Has Finally Been Reformed"
 rahenraj.97.d:0 "After a monumental amount of effort, the court has finally been reformed. The nobles are listening, the Ministries are governing, the Foreign Office is conferencing, and the military is preparing. This bodes well for the future. Prosperous times are ahead."
 rahenraj.97.a:0 "To those who said the days of the Raj were over, we say: not today!"
 rahenraj.98.t:0 "The Corruption of the Lotus Court"
 rahenraj.98.d:0 "The one thing constant in Halann is decay. Meat rots, turning grey and putrescent. Flowers wilt, vibrant colours going dull and leaves drooping. Minds erode, memories fading and simple acts becoming out of one's reach.\n\nAnd the Lotus Court, that jewel of Rahen, a place of vast feasts and incredible gardens and all the most brilliant minds of the Ministries working in one place? It is an institution surpassing most on Halann, and its decay is similarly distinguished.\n\nCorruption that siphons off the wealth of an entire continent. Internal politicking with strategems and tactics that rival any of Jaher's campaigns, all in pursuit of personal power. A veritable legion of administrators who are as short-sighted and petty as the Oracle at Tughayasa is far-seeing.\n\nThese problems have only festered under the rule of Indranayar, and may soon spell the demise of the Harimraj. It will take work rivalling any of Harimar's deeds to restore the Raja's authority, purge the ministries, and repair all that has crumbled in the interim. But if it can be done, and Rahen reforged, the Lotus Court may shine brighter than ever before, and the Harimraj with it."
 rahenraj.98.a:0 "How dare they disobey me!"
 
 rahenraj.102.t:0 "New Suspicious Ministry Estate"
 rahenraj.102.d:0 "Word on the street is that one of our ministers has constructed a palatial residence for himself and his family - a residence that he could not have built with his meagre salary as a mere upper-middle functionary in the Ministry of Philosophy. Could this be the evidence that we need to indict our venal ministers and rescue the four Ministries from the depths to which they have fallen?"
 rahenraj.102.a:0 "We should probably go on a visitation"
 rahenraj.103.t:0 "Crumbling Infrastructure in [target_province.GetName]"
 rahenraj.103.d:0 "The paved roads and irrigation canals that the Ministry of Agriculture once oversaw have been falling into disrepair for quite some time. Once, they kept Rahen's economy going; now, every last Prabhi and Senapti seems to be going their own way, having lost faith in the Ministry of Agriculture to orchestrate a good and fruitful harvest."
 rahenraj.103.a:0 "Damnit"
 rahenraj.104.t:0 "Raid on the Archives"
 rahenraj.104.d:0 "The Archives of Dhenijansar are commonly referred to as the greatest store of knowledge in Rahen, boasting as they do millions of philosophical treatises and agricultural almanacks - everything a would-be conqueror might need to shore up their control over this subcontinent. It has grown disorganised, however, and its librarians - a commission which includes representatives from each of the four Ministries - are increasingly disinterested in its operation. This has allowed certain unsavoury individuals to use the Library as a convenient storage-place for evidence of their misdeeds. We have therefore ordered a raid on the Archives. Perhaps we shall find some of the evidence that we seek there. It might even strengthen the case that we are building against the corrupt and disloyal Ministries that claim to serve us."
 rahenraj.104.a:0 "Leave no page unturned!"
 rahenraj.104.b:0 "Proceed as planned"
 rahenraj.104.c:0 "This is not proper"
 rahenraj.105.t:0 "Ministers Demand More Privileges"
 rahenraj.105.d:0 "A group of ministers have demanded that they receive more privileges. They want exemptions from property taxes and raises in pay. Otherwise, they threaten, there might be a better candidate for the position of Raja, one they would happily support."
 rahenraj.105.a:0 "Give them what they want."
 rahenraj.105.b:0 "This has to end!"
 rahenraj.106.t:0 "Evidence Found"
 rahenraj.106.d:0 "One of our loyal courtiers came up to us with a manuscript which he claims was retrieved at great personal risk. It is a clear indication of the depths to which the Ministries have fallen. We will have to use it at some point in order to obtain the political capital that we need to overhaul and reform the Ministries - but when?"
 rahenraj.106.a:0 "File it for later"
 rahenraj.106.b:0 "Use it now"
 rahenraj.107.t:0 "Honest Courtiers Replace the Corrupt"
 rahenraj.107.d:0 "We have finally wrestled control back over the court in Dhenijansar. There is still work to be done but we're seeing fewer and fewer incidents of corruption and deception. There is a clear line of progress in our court's affairs, soon we will have shaken off this time of decline."
 rahenraj.107.a:0 "Finally some cooperation!"
 rahenraj.108.t:0 "Ministers do Good Work"
 rahenraj.108.d:0 "Our Ministers have been labouring to make good their reputation in our eyes, and their efforts have borne fruit - for once. As the Raj returns to normal, a bumper harvest has been reported."
 rahenraj.108.a:0 "I guess they are good for something"

 rahenraj.121.t:0 "Raid on Ministerial Estate Finds No Evidence of Wrongdoing"
 rahenraj.121.d:0 "At the Raja's command, our most loyal soldiers have arrived at the site of one of the Suspicious Ministerial Estates. They have conducted a thorough search of the premises, seizing logbooks and holding the administrative staff for questioning. Despite this comprehensive impromptu audit of the actions of these ministers, our investigators have come up empty handed - we have revealed no crimes against the raja, embezzlement of government funds, or treasonous coordination with foreign powers. The arrested ministers have been released and all seized evidence restored, but the outraged ministers are clearly deeply insulted by our false accusations. Though we may have acted based on the best available information, this failed raid will surely impact our relationship with the ministries at large. "
 rahenraj.121.a:0 "Time to write some official apologies, then."
 rahenraj.122.t:0 "Raid on Ministerial Estate uncovers Rebellious Plot!"
 rahenraj.122.d:0 "At the Raja's command, our most loyal soldiers have arrived at the site of one of the Suspicious Ministerial Estates. They have conducted a thorough search of the premises, seizing logbooks and holding the administrative staff for questioning. In their investigations, our forces have found damning evidence that reveals that many crimes of the estate's overlords - but before arrests could be made, the ministers in question fled the scene and rallied their local guards and mercenaries to attack the Imperial Army to over their escape! It comes now to strength of arms to purge the Raj of the disease that plagues it - to battle!"
 rahenraj.122.a:0 "Order a retreat, we shall try again in the future."
 rahenraj.122.b:0 "Put down these traitorous scum!"
 rahenraj.123.t:0 "Raid on Ministerial Estate Cracks Down on Corruption"
 rahenraj.123.d:0 "At the Raja's command, our most loyal soldiers have arrived at the site of one of the Suspicious Ministerial Estates. They have conducted a thorough search of the premises, seizing logbooks and holding the administrative staff for questioning. Their investigation has yielded vast swaths of incriminating evidence that detail the many crimes, abuses, and betrayals conducted by the ministers against the workers of the estate and the government at large. The offending ministers have been taken into custody and await execution for their brazen corruption and betrayal of the trust placed in them and their office. This will certainly send a message about how the Raj treats those who abuse their office, and help us continue to build our case against more powerful High Ministers who yet avoid the grasp of the hand of justice. "
 rahenraj.123.a:0 "Good Riddance!"

 rahenraj.150.t:0 "Reformation of the Ministry of Agriculture"
 rahenraj.150.d:0 "Once, the Ministry of Agriculture managed Rahen's most vital industry: the cultivation of plants and livestock for consumption and sale. Its ministers were agronomists par excellence, and its libraries were among the best in the world for those seeking new and exciting methods to maintain the fertility of their fields. The Ministry had a monopoly on the sale and distribution of foodstuffs, and administered an immense number of granaries and warehouses. Over the past century, however, that function fell into disrepair. The irrigation systems that had kept the Raj fertile atrophied, with some being torn apart in times of war by invading armies, while the lower castes were oppressed by the very bureaucrats who had once sworn to protect them and uphold their interests.\n\nNo longer! Through deliberate and concerted action, Raja [Root.Monarch.GetName] has reformed the Ministry of Agriculture from its formerly decrepit state. The rents, incomes, fees and tariffs that had once been farmed out by disinterested and venal ministers have been returned to the control of the Lotus Court, and our farmers labour placidly on the fields, safe in the knowledge that there is once more a benevolent eye overseeing their work. With this intricate system restored to its proper functioning, we may now move on other, greater matters."
 rahenraj.150.a:0 "The Ministry of Agriculture grows once more!"
 rahenraj.151.t:0 "Reformation of the Ministry of Foreign Relations"
 rahenraj.151.d:0 "Once, the Ministry of Foreign Relations managed the Harimraj's interactions with the rest of the world. An elaborate system of diplomatic protocol and tradition ensured that the Raja's interests were observed and respected across Haless, and our ambassadors were treated with the utmost courtesy. However, the Ministry has grown corrupt over the past century. Our ambassadors became decadent, and regularly made fools of themselves in foreign courts, dragging our reputation through the mud. Most damningly, our fecklessness permitted the emergence of a monstrous power in our backyard - the Command.\n\nNo longer! We have begun once again to look outwards, ending decades of self-absorption and isolation. Our envoys have been whipped into shape, and the orderly rhythm of diplomacy has resumed once more. Royal marriages are being concluded, the Raja is referred to with the appropriate respect, and our prestige is no longer at rock-bottom. With our relations with the rest of the world once more on an even keel, we may proceed on to weightier matters..."
 rahenraj.151.a:0 "The Ministry of Foreign Relations shall continue to discharge its original function."
 rahenraj.152.t:0 "Reformation of the Ministry of Internal Relations"
 rahenraj.152.d:0 "While the other ministries dealt obliquely with our multifarious subjects, the Ministry of Internal Relations tackled the situation head-on. An immense machine comprising thousands of salaried clerks and administrators, it had a staggering amount of influence over our relationships with our subjects, controlling the arenas within which our Senaptia and Prabhia sparred and jockeyed for power. When it was running smoothly, the Raj was quiescent; peace ruled the land, and all was well. In recent years, however, the bureaucrats of the Ministry grew greedy and jealous, and believed that they - and not the Raja - knew what was best for the Raj. Their machinations weakened our legitimacy amongst our subjects, and caused their faith in our leadership to falter for a brief time. Internal conflict was on the verge of becoming commonplace.\n\nThis disaster was averted, however. On the Raja's initiative, the Ministry has undergone a comprehensive overhaul, and proper order has been restored. Our subjects, who once entertained thoughts of rebellion, have been disabused of such improper notions. The Raj is once again stable, and our grip on it stronger than ever. With our house in order, we may now redirect our gaze to other issues..."
 rahenraj.152.a:0 "A house divided against itself cannot stand, but we will be divided no longer."
 rahenraj.153.t:0 "Reformation of the Ministry of Philosphy"
 rahenraj.153.d:0 "The smallest of the four ministries but no less important despite this, the learned scholar-librarians of the Ministry of Philosophy provide the legal basis for all of the laws promulgated by the Lotus Court. It is they who tend to the diverse intellectual traditions of Rahen and the Raj, maintaining the heft and strictures and tenets and elegant turns of phrase that have characterised High Philosophy for centuries. Our servants grew indolent, however, and began prizing cleverness over wisdom. They became liabilities to the Raj rather than assets, and wasted their salaries on good food and earthly pleasures instead of on valuable scrolls and stationery. Without them, our subjects were bereft of guidance, and misrule was sure to follow.\n\nFortunately, we stepped in at the last minute, before things degenerated past the point of no return. Rightly have we purged the Ministry of Philosophy, consigning hundreds of decadent bureaucrats to the dungeons after publicising evidence of their many misdeeds. Few remained true to the initial purpose of the Ministry to which they belonged, and the Raja found it necessary to reconstitute it from scratch, relying on those who remained and designating thousands of scholars as aspirants. It was an immense task, but nothing is impossible if one has sufficient dedication. With this pillar of our government thus reconstituted, we may redirect our attention to other business..."
 rahenraj.153.a:0 "The Ministry of Philosophy emerges, renewed!"

 rahenraj.200.t:0 "Collapse of the Raj"
 rahenraj.200.d:0 "While reforming the key institutions of the Raj was attempted, the efforts have failed. The abundant corruption in the court and the feeble rule of the Raja are now known to all, and thus the Raja is no longer seen as a legitimate ruler. No one in Rahen really listens to them any more. This truly is the end of the second Harimraj."
 rahenraj.200.a:0 "It was inevitable"

 rahenraj.1001.t:0 "Our Senapti Policy"
 rahenraj.1001.d:0 "Now we have comfortably settled into our throne in Dhenijansar, we have started being approached by petitioners. One group that approaches us is the Prabhi and Senapti from different races, asking about our policy towards the Senapti. Who should we allow to take that rank? Only our own race or should all races be put into the position to take up arms in the name of the Raj?"
 rahenraj.1001.a:0 "Open Senapti ranks to all"
 rahenraj.1001.b:0 "Only our own can be Senapti"

The harimari were dressed in the most lavish robes one could buy and with the most extravagant patterns a tailor could think of. The negotiations would be split in three rounds over the course of multiple days.The harimari treated the humans not as partners or equals in these negotiations, but as a conquered people who would have no choice but to accept whatever demands were made...\n\nThe first topic of the first round of negotiations was that of reparations for what one harimari negotiator called "the frustrating nuisance of human rebellion." All assets of the richest human farmers would go directly to the coffers of the harimari who lost the most wealth during the Blood Lotus and the profits of all luxury crops like spices or cotton would be taken directly by the harimari state. The second one was the Right of Grievance, or more specifically the abolishment of this right. No longer would peasants be able to send their complaints to local lords or to make any requests of their lords. The third topic was military service. From now on the humans would only serve as cannon fodder, footfolk or menial workers and officer positions would become harimari exclusive.\n\nFinally came the question of who belonged in the lower castes. While the harimari delegation put up a united front on this topic, in reality it was split on it: Should the few harimari in the lower castes remain there? During a break in the negotiations, they debated on it and in the end decided to..."

So too societies change, not because they want to but because they strive for survival." -Radjgut the Younger\n\nThe delegations entered the palace together in a symbolic manner. By walking parallel they entered as co-equals who both wanted to end the conflict that tore the nation apart. The descendents of Harimar and the humans sat down to discuss the reformation of the caste system and through that the nation as a whole. The air could be described as tense yet relieved. The delegations started after the exchange of pleasantries and drinks. The whole negotiation would be split in three rounds with dozens of smaller topics, deals and negotiations.\n\nThe first topic was the annulment of all debts and demands for reparations. It was a contentious topic but one whose necessity was well understood. To prevent any lingering bad blood, all debts would be wiped clean. The second topic was the codification of equality in the military. The army would now operate on the basis of merit, not caste. Humans and low caste people could rise to become a general and harimari upper cast would no longer be restricted to officer corps duties. The third topic was that of economic freedom in the agricultural sector. If they chose, any harimari could now become a farmer and spend their lives in peace on their fields.\n\nAfter some more topics and points of discussion did they come to the finalising of it all; both human and harimari were co-equals in the lower castes and no distinctions would be made between them ever again. The final draft of the deal was made and both delegations left for their quarters to rest and prepare for the next round of negotiations..."

If not, the sheep might no longer obey the shepherd and abandon them, stripping the shepherd not only of their livelihood but of meaning all together. -Vidak of the Inked Claw"\n\n"The negotiations were held not in the royal palace, a villa or the house of any dignitary. No, they were to be held in a military tent, and one of human command, at that. They had shown the harimari that the era of tiger dominance was over and that the era of humanity had arrived in Rahen. It was a cloudy day and the harimari delegation was escorted under armed guard to the negotiations as the general command held no trust for them. The way the harimari were treated was a sign of the centuries of resentment from a previously subjugated and exploited people. Now the harimari would know how humanity had been treated. Officially, this was a negotiation but in reality the harimari had no room nor power for demands or suggestions. They were defeated and the humans would make all the new terms, split into three rounds of negotiations covering multiple topics. They began..\n\nThe first topic of the first round was focused on the distribution of wealth and land. The human delegation wanted vengeance and so a harsh policy of land redistribution was implemented. The harimari would lose almost all their lands and their riches would go to the victors as a way of reparations. The second topic was the full reformation of the army. No longer would the harimari be allowed to serve in the army, as the humans did not trust any of them to be loyal to the new state, effectively the former rebels were now the legitimate armed forces of the state. \n\nThe last topic was that of the final makeup of the lower castes. The harimari were being forced into becoming farmers, labourers and service folk en masse. While some humans may want to stay in the lower castes, they would be able to enjoy the spoils of the toiling harimari working for them from now on!

 blood_lotus_rebellion.301.d1:0 ""There is great virtue in the lives of the artisan, they craft the glory of their ruler through their jewellery, clothing and other works of splendor. I would even dare to say that if I were not a harimari, I would wish to be a human artisan, for the humans are the best crafts folk in the world" -Radjgut the Elder\n\nWhen the second round of negotiations started, the harimari negotiators began it with poetry explaining to the humans their need to understand their lower place in society and to focus their talents where they had the most potential. They were warned against striving for power not made for them. The harimari wanted to show the difference between the two races, yet did not want to create more anger. This time they showed the difference via food. The harimari were served a myriad of Haless’s finest teas, delicious and luxurious but not providing the energy one needs for hard labour or crafting. The humans on the other hand received nutritious food that would allow one to work for days, yet tasted bland. Afterwards the harimari laid down the multiple topics of the second round.\n\nThe first topic was that of the merchants' guilds. They were allowed to remain but with additional administrative oversight to prevent them from amassing copious amounts of wealth. The second topic was that of artisanry: The artisans would be forced to give discounts to harimari and could not sell their masterworks to humans anymore, not even to foreigners. The third topic described that the navy would be mostly manned by human sailors, but all officer positions would be taken by the harimari, because only they have the divine right to lead while humanity's place is to follow.\n\nThe final topic was that of the makeup of the middle castes. While the lower castes had only a few harimari individuals, many harimari had been artists and tradesfolk as well. Now it was up to the delegation to decide whether they could stay or elevate all of them into the upper castes, even if it was against these harimari's wishes."
 blood_lotus_rebellion.301.d2:0 ""To be a craftsman is not a matter of talent but of skill, which can be trained, perfected, and shared. No matter their heritage or race, with practice anyone could become a skilled craftsman." -Roja of SirThe harimari and human delegations were well rested and fed before entering the grand hall again for the next round of negotiations. This round dealt with the fate of the middle castes. The delegations slowly became accustomed to each other and chose to show unity by dining together instead of separately. The multiple topics were laid before them and were mostly concerned about trade rights, monopolies, production standards and in the end the makeup of the middle castes.\n\nThe first topic of the second round was focused on the rights of the merchants and who could be a merchant. It was decided that both races were allowed to become merchants if they wished and that they could both trade whatever they wished as long as they had the right permits and contracts. The second topic was that of the tradesfolk. In older times, restrictions were sometimes placed on who could buy jewellery, certain clothing items and art. These restrictions and any future restrictions are now illegal. The third topic was focused on standards. Both humans and harimari desired the best quality for the best price. A system of standardised quality tests was implemented to ensure the happiness of all. A fourth topic was that of the navy, whose common sailors had always been mostly human but who could never before lead. It was now also decided that humans would now be eligible for officer positions and even the admiralty itself.\n\nThe makeup of the middle castes would now also be decided. Whether it is true or not, many humans and harimari saw artisanry and mercantile matters as a human affair and would prefer a human middle castes. Yet some argued that while they did also believe humans were the best merchants or artisans, this new nation should open the middle castes up to both races. After some discussion and poetic debate it was decided..."
 blood_lotus_rebellion.301.d3:0 ""When harimari fight, they must always be reminded who made their armour, their weapons, and their equipment. Perhaps if they were makers themselves, they would show humility" -Hansim Balgujat, former weaponsmith of the Raj\n\nThe day was unusually cold for Rahen but it matched the mood of the harimari. In their tents, their delegates bickered: How could this have happened? How could their precious system of rule have collapsed like this? How could these simple and feeble humans best them like this? It did not matter. Their complaints meant nothing now. When the guards entered their tents they were shocked again, by their food this time. The harimar were used to rich, complex foods yet were now provided only plain Khapati bread. After their simple meal and plain water they were escorted to the negotiations once more. They sat down and again were greeted by their unsympathetic hosts who outlined today's ‘negotiations'. These talks would be focussing on the middle castes and that would mean that today they would talk about the backbone of the nation's economy; production and trade.\n\nThe first topic of the second round was that of the ‘new economy'. It became clear rather quickly that this new economy would be structured around human ownership of key production chains, trade monopolies and that the harimari would be forced to work menial jobs in these sectors. Functioning as the muscle in manufactories or salesfolk to ease trade in the mercantile sector, yet no harimari could own these businesses. The second topic was control over the navy, which would be fully transferred to humans and who would, just like the harimari, bar any non-human from positions of power and control. The third topic was on restrictions over artistic works and crafts. Human art would have only the regular state restrictions, while harimari art would be banned from the realm to prevent any "works of dissent".\n\nFinally the makeup of the entire caste was brought up, and for the first time, the harimari delegation spoke up. First the elder delegate reacted with outrage when he heard that all of harimari economic assets would be redistributed to humans, Secondly the military delegate became furious that the navy would be human only. Desperately the senior harimari delegates begged for the humans to drop the worst demands. But it was already too late, after ages of oppression, there was no mercy or sympathy. It was made clear that the middle castes would be populated with harimari, but that the humans would keep control over all the assets and businesses. After the session, the harimari delegates were escorted to their tents again, yet this time they were treated like prisoners, not esteemed delegates.\n\nThe humans bickered amongst themselves a bit afterwards, as it had not been decided whether all middle castes humans would be elevated to the upper castes or not...\n\n"

 blood_lotus_rebellion.302.d1:0 ""Dusk may come, but the dawn will follow darkness as it has always done. All will be as it was again." ~Radjgut the Elder\n\nThe day was young and the dew was glistening when the human delegation was escorted to the great hall. This last day of negotiations was nothing more than a formality. The delegations sat down and started by eating a meal. Like before the humans were not given bad food by any standards, yet it was noticeably lesser than that of the harimari. After having eaten the harimari delegation laid before the only topic of the day, that of power.\n\nAll possibilities of humans entering the upper castes were quashed. The harimari would exclusively inhabit the upper castes and all power and rights would be kept to them only. The few humans that may or may not have been part of the upper castes would be expelled into the middle castes and any assets that the harimari deemed unfit for a human would be confiscated.\n\nAfter this short round, both delegations left for their quarters. A final signing of the new accord would be held a few hours later. During the signing the harimari told the human delegation that they would one day rejoice and thank the harimari, but the delegation did not respond. Just before dispersing, one human would speak to his fellow humans loud enough for the harimari to hear: "One day your claws will be brittle like glass and then we will break them again." The harimari were shocked and disappointed.\n\nThe humans would go to their hometowns, cities or rebel remnant camps to announce the new laws and caste regulations, defeated and broken by the war and the harimari they returned to their old lives under oppression by the lotus claw..."
 blood_lotus_rebellion.302.d2:0 "When the delegations entered the great hall, they did not enter as opposing sides any longer. Instead of enemies they greeted each other as friends, exchanging pleasantries and laughing a bit before settling into seriousness for the final negotiations. The trickiness of these negotiations were in the fact that if both races were to live side by side in the upper castes, that it was necessary to change the power structure in the nation.\n\n The negotiations were split into a few topics again for ease. Luckily for the delegation, a few proposals already existed in the form of writings by the pro emancipatory harimari philosopher Radjgut the Younger, cousin of the more conservative Radjgut the Elder. Many of Radjgut the Younger's teachings and philosophical proposals were brought to the great hall for the delegations to study and gain inspiration from. Now they may reform the nation for the better.\n\nFirst of all were the courts. While they were normally run by harimari, new judges would be appointed from both races. It was decided that in cases that were applicable to both humans and harimari, the judgments would be by both a human and a harimari who would together decide a verdict. In cases specific to either humans or harimari (take, for example, tail shaving, or insult by one harimari on another in revenge of supposed wrongdoing), the case would be judged by one race only.\n\nSecondly was the question of administrators and magistrates. It was decided there would be no race requirement for any administrative or government position and both humans and harimari could climb the political ladder on their merits. The only limitations would be based upon a person's caste.\n\nThirdly were the military positions. It was decided that the upper castes could retain the right of generalship but that the army would also function in a more meritocratic fashion, in which exceptional soldiers could also rise to the highest ranks of the army and navy.\n\nIn the end, when these decisions were made law it was further decided to elevate the most prestigious and important humans in the realm to the upper castes where they would exist co-equally with the harimari.\n\nNow that the negotiations were finalised and the new accord was signed was it time to celebrate. A grand party was hosted for both human and harimari to celebrate the societal union between the races and the start of a new era; an era of racial equality. Many new friendships were made at the party, many new deals were signed between human and harimari merchants and many exchanged great stories with each other. This future may be new and uncertain, but it would not be faced alone..."
 blood_lotus_rebellion.302.d3:0 ""Red will be the rivers when humanity breaks its cage and unleashes its rampage upon Rahen. may this day never be." -Radjgut the Elder\n\nA heavy rain visited the camp and the harimari had not received any word from the humans about when the last negotiations would take place. They began to fear that there would be no more negotiations and that they would face the end of a blade soon enough until a guard entered their tent. They were to follow him as the human delegation was ready. The harimari were made to walk in the heavy rain, without umbrellas or servants to keep them dry. The symbolism was obvious when the harimari first arrived the clouds began to close in and now, when they were about to lose their privileges and power did the heavens break above them. The harimari delegation entered the tent and were greeted by humans who complained about the smell of wet cats.\n\nThe negotiations were not long as the humans did not deem it important to share most details with the harimari. Instead, the harimari were forced to present and deliver all state files, scrolls, secrets and hidden knowledge to their human conquerors to aid them in their creation in their human-dominated state. The harimari pleaded for a short transition period but the humans were relentless. The harimari would not rule over them again any longer, not even for a single day. Any postheld by the harimari was to be taken over by humans, from the lowest officers to the greatest ruler, all would be human from now on."

No, it truly punishes those who must meet it out as they are forced to inflict hurt as a lesson, yet such pain is known to be a necessary evil" -Radjgut the Elder\n\nFarms were raided, villages burned and people slaughtered. The attempt at changing the caste system to one that is more favourable to humans has failed, and now the common folk are feeling the repercussions. Many harimari are no longer pretending to be benevolent overlords and guardians of humans, many have instead resorted to terror and open oppression. The harimari are now showing what happens when they are spoken against and a new future has dawned, a grim future for humanity that is.\n\nKnowing that the punishment would be harsh, the humans that were chosen to negotiate the surrender would focus on damage control. They hoped that the worst impulses like mass executions or enslavement could be averted. They were escorted to a military encampment within a ruined palace to formally surrender and discuss terms. There would be few real negotiations and the surrender that was demanded was in all practical terms unconditional and absolute.\n\nThe message was clear, there would be no human victory, not even the slightest hint or glimpse of it. The castes would now not only revert to their traditional makeups, in which the humans inhabited the lower and middle castes, they would also have no way to go up a caste ever again. All castes would be locked and would never open again, at least not under this new, stricter harimari regime.\n\nIt was over, humanity had lost and was now forced to pick up the pieces once more..."

The benevolent oversight and parental obligation of the old harimari rulers was no more. While they were familiar with unrest, they did not expect the tensions to end in this...\n\nAfter having defeated and broken the state resistance, the humans began reshaping the country. They first came for the administration, which they replaced with their own, seizing all scrolls and documents and forcing out all harimari from their roles. After this they came for the riches of the palaces, the spoils of which were shared amongst the "most noble" of humans and then to the common folk. Then they seized the last strongholds and flushed out the last bastions of harimari resistance and arrested all leading figures of the harimari community. The harimari were presented the terms of surrender for all of the realms harimari, and there would be no chance that the humans would allow for any demands to be made.\n\nWhen presented with the new terms, one thing was clear: the caste system would be flipped completely and the harimari would have no say in what changes were made. The harimari were forced into the lower and middle castes to work and labour for new human masters. Their companies and businesses would be seized and run by humans. Now, with the old caste system reversed, the harimari would experience the oppression and hopelessness humans had felt for ages. An uncertain future awaited the nation..."
