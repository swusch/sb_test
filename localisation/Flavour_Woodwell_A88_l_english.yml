 A88_druids_title:0 "Druids, Arisen"
 A88_druids_desc:0 "The once proud lands of Carneter have fallen into a deplorable state. The last of their realms clinging to a shred of independence is a backwater, adrift from its past and with no future to call its own. That must change. The druids are the last true heirs of the Carnetori, the only ones who remember the days of oak and river, the days of the trees and hillocks. And perhaps, with their aid, we, too, may remember once more."
 A88_more_work_title:0 "Honest Work"
 A88_more_work_desc:0 "The one thing Woodwell has traditionally lacked are the myriad crafts of the great Cannorian cities and towns. Deep in the woods, our people live mostly in shrouded hamlets and small towns strung along amongst the more well trodden routes through the deep forest.\n\nBut the times are changing and a growing burgher class has been increasingly vocal in their demands to make proper use of our country’s wealth, primarily in the form of the coveted Carnetori Oak. The wood of this tree is not only strong and beautiful, but touched by the fey. If we are to go down this path, we will of course need to construct further infrastructure and establish the administration necessary to handle these projects, but it will surely be worth it."
 A88_warcry_title:0 "A Cry for War"
 A88_warcry_desc:0 "As it stands, we are a scrawny dog backed into a corner. To the north stands Eilisin, whose claws wrap around the very heart of Carneter’s woodlands. And to the south and west prowl Pearlsedge and Lorent respectively, whose navies ever hunger for our lumber.\n\nIt seems we must remind them that we are of Ancard’s blood, and like him, we shall suffer no greedy fools coveting our home."
 A88_reclaim_title:0 "Reclaim Lost Land"
 A88_reclaim_desc:0 "The time has come. The strength of our arms is fuelled by our righteous fury, we stand as one with our faithful allies, and we have united our people behind one goal: Reclaim what was lost, and punish those who have dared to take it from us. Move swiftly betwixt the trees, strike them hard and fast, and reclaim our honor. From this day onward, let not even the most ignorant vagabond claim we are a weak or moribund people.\n\nLeave none standing."
 A88_woodwork_title:0 "Out of The Woodwork"
 A88_woodwork_desc:0 "With the land prosperous, our borders secure, and our freedom recognized, many in our country have been tempted to recline and enjoy the fruits of our labor. After all, with the rising might and prestige of Woodwell, many are now trying to work with us, instead of against us. There is, some would say, no need for more relentless labor.\n\nWrong. There is one more deed we need to perform to ensure our nation is truly as it should be; the realm must be properly centralized, commanded by the crown and its loyal advisors. The rivalling factions must be placated, the local administrators reined in, and the lands made stable. Only then may we rest, secure in the knowledge that we have done our utmost for the bright future of Woodwell."
 A88_support_title:0 "Writing Down Support"
 A88_support_desc:0 "The burghers of our realm have always been embroiled in a fierce rivalry with the druids, as they have long coveted the rich timber of the Deruwren, for ships, tools, and now paper. However, to support the goal of reasserting ourselves on the map of Cannor, the druids have reluctantly… acquiesced to some of the merchant’s demands.\n\nIf some of our woodlands could be developed and profitable trade routes for their products established, we could gain great favor with the burghers, and earn their lasting support for our aims. And lest we forget, this course of action will provide us with a steady supply of paper so that we may pen our epic story of rebirth."
 A88_cultivation_title:0 "Culture Cultivated"
 A88_cultivation_desc:0 "They sing and speak so much of Dameria, and of Lencenor. Of Luminaries and High Kings, and of their tragedies and triumphs. But who sings and speaks of Carneter? Of the rivers and the trees, of the spirits and the men, of brave Ancard, who spilt his life’s essence upon the waters to give his home one more taste of freedom. These stories, once known true, now fade from the memories of all but the eldest of druids.\n\nWe shall not have our stories, our heritage be forgotten and denied, we shall tell all who would listen who we truly are."
 A88_diplomacy_title:0 "Old Enemy, New Friend"
 A88_diplomacy_desc:0 "In order to face these new enemies, perhaps our old foes, diminished by time, could be used for our advantage. Wesdam, former march of a forlorn Dameria, had once been the frontier of an empire that sought to subdue our people, but are now in such a weakened state that they cannot afford to refuse offered help. At least not if they wish to realise their lofty ambitions regarding the holdings of their former master - something we can use to our advantage. The Roilsardi, people of the thorn, are all too familiar with that noble resistance we seek. And Tretun, home of a people as ancient as ours, has been brought low by the Pearlsedgers. Together, we shall act."

 flavour_woodwell.1.t:0 "To Grow From Reeds"
 flavour_woodwell.1.d:0 "“I don’t understand,” the boy complained, gesturing to the legal texts and decrees he was reading, “Why do I have to learn all of this?”\n\n“Because, Attalus,” Answered the young druid, “It is important for a ruler to understand how his realm functions. And that means reading boring scrolls on jurisprudence and studying taxation lists on parchment.”\n\n“I could have my servants read it for me.”\n\n“And then it would be their realm. If you let others do your work for you, they can control you, tell you whatever they please.”\n\n“Really? None of you have ever done that to me, right?”\n\nMarion could only nod and watch as the boy went back to reading the taxation reports. It was times like these where he wondered what his mentor, Talien, had been thinking all those years ago, when he had put his plan in motion. He knew it was for the good of the realm, he knew it was a task given to Talien, and later himself, by truer powers of the Deruwren than mere mortal lords. But it felt wrong, and Marion didn’t think that feeling would ever truly go away.\n\nAfter a few moments of contemplation, he gave some advice to Attalus."
 flavour_woodwell.1.a:0 "“You just need to overcome the boredom and push forward.”"
 flavour_woodwell.1.b:0 "“You’re the Lord now, go with your gut, whatever you deem‘fair’ is yours to choose."
 flavour_woodwell.2.t:0 "Support of The Spirits"
 flavour_woodwell.2.d:0 "Attalus’ voice broke the silence. “Is something supposed to be happening-”\n\nMarion answered him with a tap on the leg with his staff. “Shush.” He added.\n\nThe boy, now older, stood in the center of the grove, surrounded by the circle of druids, who chanted in Old Lencori, the ancient language of the Carnetori. To be honest, Attulus did not understand exactly ‘why’ he needed to participate in this. His father hadn’t, and his mother seemed apprehensive to let Marion or the rest organize this whole affair.\n\n“The ceremony is important, it was performed by every king of Carneter, since the times of-”\n\nAttalus interrupted. “Lorenan and Ancard, I know,” his hands wrung together to stop himself from squirming due to boredom and strain, “But I don’t understand why I need to do this. I’m no king, I'm hardly a lord.”\n\n“The point is that this is an ancient ceremony that has been extremely important to our ancient people and still is to us druids. So you will undertake it and you will not complain.”\n\n“...Yes Marion.”\n\nJust then, there was the sound of rustling in the underbrush at the edge of the clearing, and a strange sight emerged from it. A procession of winged serpents, hovering across the path, writhing with the movements of the wind. “Cualebris.” The Druid whispered their name in quiet awe.\n\n“Cualebris,” Attalus spoke, trying his best to sound authoritative but not demanding, “The time will come for me to rule this land in my own right. I seek your blessing, for a long and prosperous reign.”\n\nAfter a few moments, the Cualebris began to dance around him, making great and terrific noises like the dragons of yore. Attalus felt a mix of awe and fear, to gaze upon such amazing spirits of the forest, to have them choose him, a foundling of the forest.\n\nAs soon as it began, it was done, and the serpent-spirits of the Deruwren departed from the grove, leaving only the druids and Attalus behind. Marion swiftly approached to congratulate him."
 flavour_woodwell.2.a:0 "“You have a good heart. They can always see that.”"
 flavour_woodwell.2.b:0 "“You spoke well, it was your tongue which convinced them.”"
 flavour_woodwell.3.t:0 "Marching On"
 flavour_woodwell.3.d:0 "Attalus gripped the double handed axe, the handle slippery with sweat. “Are you sure that this is a good idea?” He looked in front of him, where several very large and very scary men stood on the other side of a rickety bridge.\n\nMarion only shrugged. “Ancard held his own against many warriors sent by the High King of Lencenor. We’ve only sent three your way.”\n\n“Yes, but those axes are sharp!”\n\n“Well of course, why would we hit you with blunt axes?”\n\n“Because you’re not trying to kill me?”\n\n“True warriors are hardly forged from mock battles with dulled axes and without intent to kill. I’d recommend you fight, my Lord.”\n\nAttalus grumbled and murmured curses beneath his breath, but he gripped his axe tighter and took stock of his enemies. And with a deep breath, he marched onto the bridge. The wooden planks creaked and groaned, and the structure swerved slightly as the warriors mimicked his actions, closing in on him.\n\nThe fight was half wrestling bout, half balancing act, with Attalus using his axe to block their blows while he tried to grapple and push them over. It was almost no use though, for even as he kicked two into the water below, the third rushed towards him like a bear, threatening to make him a head shorter.\n\nBut Attalus took a deep breath, and jammed the base of his axe against the man’s nose, before throwing him off into the river. Only slightly bloodied and bruised, he raised his axe up as the crowd of nobles, peasants, and druids cheered. And as he smiled, Marion gave a solemn nod and put a comforting hand on his shoulder."
 flavour_woodwell.3.a:0 "“You’d be a good King.”"
 flavour_woodwell.3.b:0 "“You’ll be a good warrior.”"
 flavour_woodwell.4.t:0 "A Child From The Reeds"
 flavour_woodwell.4.d:0 "Suddenly something startled the stag Humbert was hunting and, before he had time to release his arrow, it was long gone, disappearing into the dense undergrowth. He looked around. The water in the small creek reflected the sunlight of a perfect crisp autumn day, and the reeds waved slowly before a light breeze. Was that laughter? He realized now what must have startled the animal.\n\nIn a cradle, floating among the reeds, lay a giggling little baby. Judging by his smile, Humbert would later say that the boy appeared to have never known fear in his short life."
 flavour_woodwell.4.a:0 "Surely an auspicious sign of fortune for Woodwell."
 flavour_woodwell.5.t:0 "Humbert's Demise"
 flavour_woodwell.5.d:0 "The boy stood before the grave, as his mother muttered prayers to Nerat and Falah, the goddess closest to Humbert’s heart. He was, as the boy was told many times, truly fond of a hunt. They gave offerings of fruit, and flowers, and the many antlers the late lord had amassed from his hunting excursions over the years. Throughout these proceedings, all the boy could think about was whether his father was happy, wherever he was.\n\nAnd then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the druids approach. They dressed in blacks, greens, and browns, almost appearing to be just a part of the woods themselves. The one in front, a man who seemed older than even his late father, looked at him with soft eyes, green like moss, before speaking to his mother.\n\n“With the new lord being so young, we were hoping to negotiate the terms of the regency-”\n\n“Here? At the funeral?” His mother snapped, and the boy felt her hand on his shoulder tighten. “Perhaps you mean to use my late husband’s tomb as a gathering hall, or his tombstone as a feasting table!”\n\n“I did not mean to offend.”\n\n“Well you have. You have been curious about this boy since Humbert found him… but you are right. My son needs to be tutored properly, and as such I will allow you to take him into the woods and raise him amongst the druids, provided I am a part of his regency council.” A pause. “And I get to visit him whenever I choose.”\n\nThe druid smiled. “A fair compromise as always, my lady.” The boy felt his mother reluctantly let go of him, and the druid beckoned him forward. Against his better judgement, he obeyed. Yet the feeling of betrayal started to simmer in the pit of his stomach. Why was he being taken into the woods by these strange people, why did his mother let him go, why did his father die and leave him as lord?"
 flavour_woodwell.5.a:0 "And thus the wheels of fate began to turn once more."
 flavour_woodwell.6.t:0 "Competition From The Bushes"
 flavour_woodwell.6.d:0 "“It is folly.” Spoke the noble, as they walked amongst the wooden statues of previous counts and the kings before them, all the rulers of Carneter. “The boy is some babe Humbert found in the woods.”\n\n“Yet it was his will.” Spoke the druid, stroking his beard as he stared back at the lord, “Does it truly matter if he is Humbert’s blood?”\n\n“Yes!” Lord Austen spat. “Our noble blood has ruled these lands for countless generations, since the elder days of Lorenan and Ancard. Why is this boy fit to rule and we are not?”\n\n“I can assure you, the boy is being raised to the utmost standards. He learns the poetry and oratory of his peers, how to fight and hunt, and how to administer a realm.”\n\n“And yet he is no noble, he is in all likelihood some peasant child left to die in a year of dirth.”\n\nThe druid, upon hearing this, stood taller, and at once the noise of birdsong, scampering animals and the rustle of wind through the trees seemed to cease, as if cowed by his displeasure. “Are you questioning the last will of your late lord?”\n\nThe noble was silent, but only for a moment."
 flavour_woodwell.6.a:0 "“No, I am questioning its executor.”"
 flavour_woodwell.7.t:0 "Pearlsedgers Make Their Move."
 flavour_woodwell.7.d:0 "The time has come: the nobility have finally decided to try to push their claim. The pearls gleam menacingly."
 flavour_woodwell.7.a:0 "What will happen now?"
 flavour_woodwell.8.t:0 "The Council of Woodwell"
 flavour_woodwell.8.d:0 "The lords, priests, burghers, and, in a rare show of force, the druids of the forest groves had come to Woodwell town, the small but refurbished capital of the realm. They filed through the entrance into a newly built chamber, where stood Marion, the would-be lord’s regent and key advisor, though some lords laughed at that idea.\n\n“Welcome, noble dignitaries of the realm, are we now able to discuss the matter of succession?”\n\n“Indeed we are.” Announced Lord Austen, “Are you still parading that boy around as-”\n\n“Boy?” Came a cry, and in strode Attalus, attired in finely spun woolen robes, now standing half a foot taller than even the lord, “Do you think me just a boy still?”\n\nThey glared at one another, until the lord replied. “...You are some mongrel babe Humbert found during a hunt. What claim to noble blood do you have?”\n\n“And what valor do you possess? I have studied the history and ways of our people. I have hunted and fought amongst commoners and nobles alike, in the elder customs passed down from the times of Ancard. I have known hunger and fear and sorrow.”\n\n“And that makes you a lord?”\n\n“It makes me wise. What makes me a lord is their word, not yours.” He then turned to the estates, “Who would you have to lead us all? Some idle baron who has never left his manor? Or a man who has walked amongst you all, who is Humbert’s chosen successor, and who has the blessing of the gods, men, and spirits for his reign?”The estates cheered as he finished his oration, and he turned to Marion."
 flavour_woodwell.8.a:0 "“The Druid merely smiled.”"
 flavour_woodwell.9.t:0 "Annexation of The County of Woodwell."
 flavour_woodwell.9.d:0 "Due to decades of internal instability and unrest, as well as the mishandling of local politics, the aristocrats of Woodwell have pledged their support if we make a move to oust their ineffictive rulers and put them out of their misery."
 flavour_woodwell.9.a:0 "With pleasure."
