  #Column 1, Part 1
  az_an_detestable_creatures_title:0 "Detestable Creatures"
  az_an_detestable_creatures_desc:0 "The peoples of Halann can be divided cleanly in two: those who create history, and those who destroy it. Lacking civilization in their own right, the goblins grew feral with envy. In 1439 they broke through the ancient runic seal of pacific Ovdal-az-Ân, running amok among the archives and temple-complexes of the Granite Hold. They sacked and pillaged, in some cases collapsing entire archival caverns and destroying records dating back millennia. The most venerable and holy tradition of dwarvenkind was sundered for the sake of petty plunder, the wise and good carted away to attend petty village chiefs in their laughable puppet theatres of court life.\n\nWe have learned that these creatures can swarm together, their simple minds capable of the drunkard's blind hostility and the bovine seething of the mob. We will never again underestimate their savagery. For as long as Ovdal-az-Ân stands, let these vermin know only our wrath."
  az_an_teachings_goblinsbane_title:0 "Teachings of Goblinsbane"
  az_an_teachings_goblinsbane_desc:0 "Goblinsbane is a strange character to find wandering the granite archives of Ovdal-az-Ân. He is boisterous, rarely stands on ceremony and seems to drink his weight in ale each day. Yet fate makes agents even of men such as he, and his nickname alone attests to his prodigious talent for annihilating goblinkind.\n\nWe were adventurers once, now scholars and restorers, but we have never conducted extended campaigns of the kind in which Goblinsbane specialises. His expertise should be recorded in the granite archives and his military doctrine disseminated among our commanders."
  #Part 2
  az_an_restore_undergrowth_title:0 "Restore the Undergrowth"
  az_an_restore_undergrowth_desc:0 "Around us are caverns that twist in upon themselves in unending spirals. Our ancestors once called them the ‘Undergrowth’. Countless tales spoke of unprepared travelers pacing in circles in hopes of reaching old Amldihr or even distant Bulwar, only to end up in a completely different (and often more dangerous) destination.\n\nFor the sake of the general good and right-believing pilgrims seeking the legendary birthplace of Dwarfkind, we must organize patrols and map these labrythine passageways."
  az_an_meaning_of_granite_title:0 "The Meaning of Granite"
  az_an_meaning_of_granite_desc:0 "What does 'Granite Dwarf' even mean? We are not a distinct people from our relatives on the surface, nor even from our ancestors who were Amethyst Dwarves. The Jade Dwarves of Grônstunad, or their Granite descendants now enslaved by hobgoblins—how different are we from them?\n\nThe high clergy assure us that it is our unwavering faith in the Gods that defines us. They say that our Granite identity is a derivative of our devotion to the pantheon. We want to believe that, but we cannot be certain yet. After all, granite as a rock is no more inherently religious than a pebble of unknown provenance."
  az_an_halannas_chambers_title:0 "Halanna's Chambers"
  az_an_halannas_chambers_desc:0 "What was once groups of ten or twenty pilgrims per month has now grown into a congregation of thousands per week. Countless impromptu shrines, set up in chambers and alcoves not threatened by the elements or hostile creatures, have coalesced into a single great center of worship. This in turn has caused residences to be established, of which an increasing proportion are permanent homes.\n\nThe faithless question, “Why establish such a settlement in a place as dangerous as that?” We retort: “A place for the Gods and believers is always worth it.” We need only some small expenditure of resources to turn Halanna’s chambers into a prosperous and holy settlement befitting our nation."
  #Part 3
  az_an_proper_education_title:0 "Proper Education"
  az_an_proper_education_desc:0 "Lo! The Hall of Dagrin, Father and Progenitor, has grown into one of the foremost religious institutions upon the face of His world! As our hold was revived from the brink of destruction, so too has the knowledge of His word and His Pantheon been brought back from the brink of oblivion! Moreover, we should rejoice twice-over, for we have done more than any thought possible - we have spread His word and His enlightenment to others. Not just dwarves, but humans, harimari, and others from beyond have flocked to our gates, wishing to learn of the Pantheon, of our manners and ways! We dare not let their impure thoughts taint the sanctity of the Hold of One, but great Grôzumdihr, with its history of welcoming surface folk, should prove acceptable. Let us move the Hall to Grôzumdihr, and foster a new bastion of learning and theology."
  az_an_our_own_achievement_title:0 "Our Own Achievement"
  az_an_our_own_achievement_desc:0 "At the centre of our hold lies the grand cavern of Argrâstun, within which sits the throne of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], divinely-appointed guardian of Dagrin’s children. Yet our priests believe Argrâstun could be so much more than just the capital of our holy demesne, and that Vûrodrmonir’s power could be used to aid the holy magics of our clerics.\n\nWe shall begin the construction of a massive ritual circle, unmatched in size and grandeur, to act as the focal point for our magical energies. Not even Verkal Dromak could have envisioned this, our most sacred and divinely-inspired monument to the power and glory of the Pantheon, our greatest work yet. Joztralanna may have passed on, but her legacy shall shine forth, her gifts of magic to dwarvenkind renewed, in Argrâstun Cathedral!"
  az_an_manipulators_of_magic_title:0 "Manipulators of Magic"
  az_an_manipulators_of_magic_desc:0 "For millennia, the greatest magicians of the Dwarovar dwelled in the Malachite hold of Verkal Dromak. Their magical ability was truly awe-inspiring when they were at their height, but as with the rest of Aul-Dwarov, decay wore away at their strength and their majesty, and their magics did not save them or their hold when the goblins came. But now, with Vûrodrmonir’s power, it is clear to all that we Granite Dwarves are the new masters of magic in the Serpentspine.\n\nEven the Malachite Dwarves of old would fall to their knees in supplication, begging to be permitted access to but a fragment of our holy knowledge and power! And perhaps we would even allow them to be granted such boons, for our divine control over the magical arts is unmatched, and at our heart lies the hallowed ground of Argrâstun, ablaze eternally with Joztralanna’s power! The laws and shape of nature are now ours to command. Let the peoples of Halann tremble, for the Granite Dwarves shall brook no rival over the mystical world of magic."

  #Column 2, Part 1
  az_an_remnants_ancestors_title:0 "Of Remnants and Ancestors"
  az_an_remnants_ancestors_desc:0 "Even as we scramble to reclaim our hold, minds return to the sack of 1439. For all of its longevity, Ovdal-az-Ân never had to contend with the kind of warfare we are seeing now. We are bereft of the vast ancient dwarven logistical network and can boast no mage of the calibre of Queen Odna II, whose magic sealed away the hold in the first place.\n\nOur eyes thus turn naturally to Ovdal Kanzad. In the Cannonhold we can doubtless find both the recorded expertise and the infrastructure to field an artillery army of our own. Turned on the goblins, our cannon will annihilate entire tribes by the salvo."
  #Part 2
  az_an_open_air_title:0 "Open Air..."
  az_an_open_air_desc:0 "The repair of Grôzumdihr and its famous Green Gate was a costly endeavour in time, money, and resources. It was even dangerous – we lost several good, solid workers to accidents and disasters. But the work is done, and the objective complete. Dwarves can at last reunite with their friends and family who were unable to return to their homes. There is already talk of restoring the Exilarch to his Peridot Throne.\n\nNot all are happy. Some of the faithful are hostile to the outsiders. "They know nothing of our people," they shout, insisting furthermore that the outlanders' continued ancestralism and tolerance (which they call complacency) are incompatible with our ideals."
  az_an_closed_doors_title:0 "...Closed Doors"
  az_an_closed_doors_desc:0 "As our control over the Tree of Stone solidifies, we cannot help but notice how felicitous and happy the dwarves are. To be entirely honest, our dwarves are better off than any other dwarves under all the mountains and skies, so why do we need them? We should shut the gates once more and prosper in solitude."
  az_an_beauty_of_isolation_title:0 "Beauty of Isolation"
  az_an_beauty_of_isolation_desc:0 "Our beloved Hold of One is not merely a religious hold.  From 2203 BA to the Goblin invasion in 1439 AA, we isolated ourselves from our brethren in the hopes that our people could live in tranquility.  Three millennia of peace, stability, and security for Ovdal-az-Ân.\n\nSuch peace is hard to attain in this chaotic world we live in, but no longer impossible.  Our diplomats have assured us that there are too few worthy of our presence in Serpentspine, nay, Halann.  Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decree an official foreign policy of total isolation.  No trade deals, no passage through our lands, and no allies.  Without such obligations, our people can focus inward and prosper once more!"
  az_an_one_grand_lonely_hold_title:0 "One Grand Lonely Hold"
  az_an_one_grand_lonely_hold_desc:0 "We have recovered Vûrodrmonir and returned to the worship of the true Gods, tearing down so-called ancestors from their idolatrous pedestals. We have laid claim to holds and tunnels that were mere stories to the Granite Dwarves of ages past. We have created a pure hold, a sacred hold—but our work is under threat.\n\nOutside of the hold there is impurity. Heresy everywhere we look. “Ancestralism is the way,” some fools claim. Others dare to suggest that the Dwarovar is not worth returning to. The influence of asinine ideas such as these even manages to corrupt dwarfkind, and may corrupt us too if we do not take action.\n\nThanks be to the Gods that Vûrodrmonir is in our hands, then. We may be able to replicate the ritual that once sealed Ovdal-az-Ân off from the rest of the world – but in a way that encompasses the whole Tree of Stone. Let us see it done, the better to live in absolute peace and tranquility!"
  #Part 3
  az_an_lets_lament_title:0 "Lets Lament"
  az_an_lets_lament_desc:0 "“In the name of the Pantheon, of our creators and guardians, of our guides and salvation, let us give thanks to one and all, and let us pray for those who yet remain outside our divinely-ordained guidance.\n\nWe offer this prayer to you, O great and mighty ones.\n\nWe ask Our Father, in his wisdom, to watch over us and guide us in all that we do, in His name and for His glory and the glory of the Pantheon.\n\nWe ask Our Mother, in her beneficence, to share the warmth of Her hearth eternal, to bless us with her grace, and judge us fairly when it is our time to return to Her.\n\nWe ask the Mason to guide our chisels and hammers, so that all monuments and constructs shall ne’er go awry, that our edifices shall endure, as Granite endures.\n\nWe ask the Brewer to bless our kegs, so that the holy liquor shall forever flow, and be drunk in celebration of Him and others of the Pantheon…”"
  az_an_veneration_title:0 "Veneration"
  az_an_veneration_desc:0 "Our divine guardians, blessed with the power of magic entrusted to them by Joztralanna from beyond through holy Vûrodrmonir, have been growing ever stronger in the arcane, ever more well-versed in the magical arts, ever more competent at divining the will of the Pantheon.\n\nClearly it is a sign from upon high - our people and our leaders have been chosen! Chosen by the gods, to enact their designs upon Halanna’s creation in her absence! Chosen to lead the dwarven people into a new age, an age of veneration and divine worship, to strike down our ancient enemies that sought to snuff out our holy fire, chosen to forever work sacred rites to learn more about the will of the gods, and how we may best serve them in all things!\n\nPraise be to the Pantheon! Praise be to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], for they are our shield and protector! Praise be to the Hold of One!"
  az_an_revered_respected_revival_title:0 "Revered Revival"
  az_an_revered_respected_revival_desc:0 "The mountains thunder, the earth roars! After we have seen our fledgling pantheon grow stronger and stronger, our congregation grow larger and larger, we finally see the true glories of our gods. We rejoice in the crystalline light, we dance under the ribbed vaults of our mountain-faith. Long live the Reborn Pantheon!"

  #Column 3, Part 1
  az_an_clear_our_home_title:0 "Clear our Home!"
  az_an_clear_our_home_desc:0 "As we begin to unseal the collapsed passages of Ovdal-az-Ân, we rediscover nothing less than our history. An immense amount of work exists here; even after we have cleared the old archives and temples, we will need to catalogue everything we have found, to say nothing of beginning to learn from it once more.\n\nAs the members of our company divide themselves among the chambers, they begin to form the basis of new clans: a group of restorers find a gorgeous mural and name themselves after it, an excavation corps recover the text of an archival slab beneath extensive water damage and boast thereafter of the deed. The indispensable prove themselves in this titanic task, the weight of stone pressing out their character.\n\nTime marches forward, and we cannot truly reclaim the glory of what once was. But united in purpose, the reborn Granite Dwarves chisel new life from the igneous rock."
  az_an_granite_retellings_title:0 "Granite Retellings"
  az_an_granite_retellings_desc:0 "We walk among its ruins, yet Ovdal-az-Ân is not dead. Between those who successfully fled to Ghankheden and those we have liberated from the goblins already, dwarves remain who remember the time before the hold was sundered. They speak of the noble peace of ages, of a pristine and placid existence in communion with both history and dwarven faith.\n\nPerhaps told alone such stories would not take hold, but we walk after all in the shadows of the ancient archives and temples, carved into solid granite. Even as they lived in solitude away from the world, the dwarves of Ovdal-az-Ân maintained histories and sagas. Our people yearn to restore this venerable high culture."
  az_an_old_pantheon_title:0 "The Old Pantheon"
  az_an_old_pantheon_desc:0 "We came here to restore Ovdal-az-Ân, yet this is no simple matter of replastering the walls and putting on a coat of paint. Where other holds may dismiss history as merely a procession of great dwarves, we are not so blind. Dwarven civilisation was once bound by holy purpose; when that purpose wavered, our civilisation collapsed. Even Ovdal-az-Ân, slowest to sag into decadence, was eventually punished for its complacency.\n\nHalanna lives, and some yet live who would do her will again. Revering as we do the achievements of our ancestors, we will no longer blasphemously elevate them to the status of gods. It is time for Ovdal-az-Ân to embody its original purpose once more as the greatest bastion and defender of the dwarven faith."
  #Part 2
  az_an_monumental_legacy_title:0 "A Monumental Legacy"
  az_an_monumental_legacy_desc:0 "To outsiders, especially ancestralist fanatics, we are nothing more than a group of old fogies rocking back and forth while reading books written in languages we do not understand. Contrary to the scuttlebutt, the real Ovdal-az-Ân is not merely a hold consecrated to isolated devotion. We have also taken great pride in the construction of many great feats of monumentalism and structures in dedication to our faith and the State.\n\nDevoted architects are (very insistently) asking for permission to rebuild the old works, destroyed as they have been by the degenerate heirs of Grobilazk. When they are not pestering the executive power, they are going above and beyond their predecessors – they are even going so far as to prepare designs for new, advanced infrastructure. We do well to put this eagerness to use for the sake of the Gods."
  az_an_lesson_in_heresy_title:0 "A Lesson in Heresy"
  az_an_lesson_in_heresy_desc:0 "Our faith has grown more and more important. By now we require greater facilities to honor the Gods. To this end, prominent members of the Architect’s Guild and our own advisors have proposed to repurpose a center of theological thought into the Hul-az-Dagrin, the Hall of Dagrin. This institution shall serve as a beacon of knowledge and learning about our past, our faith, and the truths revealed to us."
  az_an_argrastuns_secret_title:0 "Argrâstun's Secret"
  az_an_argrastuns_secret_desc:0 "The Argrâstun Cathedral, a proud beacon of the faith, restored to its ancestral glory, has served as a center for our faith for some time now. As more and more dwarves visit, we slowly discover older, unused parts of the structure, including a strange crevice, which leads into the dark, until the stuffy tunnel terminates in a door. No one knows what lies beyond…"
  #Part 3
  az_an_freeing_our_bretheren_title:0 "Freeing our Bretheren"
  az_an_freeing_our_bretheren_desc:0 "The Command and their hated "slave states" built their empires upon the backs of many dwarven slaves, chained and tormented as chattel beneath the lash of a goblin whip. We have claimed much of the Jade Mines (Hah! If Grônstunad could see us now…) and freed many of our kin, be they Granite, Jade, Emerald or otherwise, from their agonies.\n\nWhilst we still may not trust the dwarves of other holds, hotbeds of heresy and weakness as they are, we would never wish this cruel, pathetic fate upon any of the children of the Pantheon, a fate most ignoble! For many, forever lost to the Serpentspine or to the predations of the goblins, our salvation has not come soon enough, and for many others must be nursed back to health, frail and withered as they are from neglect and suffering. But, children of Dagrin, let us now rejoice! We will avenge the fallen, as Argezenna lends us her strength, and we will slake our axes’ thirst for blood as we enact our righteous and divine vengeance upon the spawn of Grobilazk!"
  az_an_righting_two_wrongs_title:0 "Righting Two Wrongs"
  az_an_righting_two_wrongs_desc:0 "For millennia immemorial, the Jade Mines have been governed not by the distant hands of Aul-Dwarov, but by the administrators of Grônstunad, the Eastern Capital of the old dwarven empire. Now, for the first time, the Jade Mines are fully under another control - our control. Jade no longer flows inward, but outward, into our coffers."
  az_an_the_holy_east_title:0 "The Holy East"
  az_an_the_holy_east_desc:0 "Not since the days of Aul-Dwarov has the Eastern Serpentspine seen such grandeur and holy devotion, and it is all thanks to us, the Granite Dwarves. We, who sealed ourselves away as the heretical world around us burned and withered, who whispered prayers to the Pantheon even as our faith was tested in our people’s darkest hours. All true Granite folk venerate the Pantheon in all things, but alas, our divine demesne does not reach all corners of the Serpentspine…\n\nThe West lacks faith,  as they always have. First to abandon the gods when Aul-Dwarov fell, and their new-found piety with their “rediscovery” of our gods doubtless lacks a true believer’s righteous fervour. No… we shall not accept this state of affairs. The Gods would never permit it!\n\nWe will bring the true light of the Pantheon to the Western Serpentspine. All those who oppose us shall fall. Dagrin’s will be done."
  az_an_an_an_anda_title:0 "Ân an Ânda"
  az_an_an_an_anda_desc:0 "One and Only.\n\nWe must fulfill our true destiny."

  #Column 4, Part 1
  az_an_secure_surroundings_title:0 "Secure our Surroundings"
  az_an_secure_surroundings_desc:0 "What have we learned from the sack of 1439? A homesteader cannot allow the vermin to reach the threshold of the cottage. She must set traps across the whole property, long before she sees a single rat, or else risk reacting far too late. Never again will the goblins have the leeway to bang noisily at our door; we will strike them down the moment they enter the garden."
  #Part 2
  az_an_seat_of_power_title:0 "The Seat of Power"
  az_an_seat_of_power_desc:0 "In the middle of the Upper Hold there lies a derelict ruin, a mere shadow of its old greatness. This was once the great Cathedral of Argrâstun, which was nothing less than the administrative nerve-center of both Ovdal-az-Ân itself and the priesthood of the Dwarven Pantheon. When the old Ovdal-az-Ân was lost, it was one of the last buildings to fall.\n\nWe have already partially renovated the cathedral in order to permit religious congregations of our great and exalted gods to execute their religious duties. Now, however, we should act to restore it to its former glory at the earliest possible opportunity."
  az_an_devotion_under_pantheon_title:0 "Devotion For the Pantheon"
  az_an_devotion_under_pantheon_desc:0 "There are dwarves in the temples and halls, silently praying. There are dwarves before their hearth-shrines awaiting guidance. There are dwarves descending into the mines, quietly whispering an ode to the Gods. Those are the manifestations of our faiths in their multitude. Each dwarf; An exemplary devoted."
  #Part 3
  az_an_its_called_the_dwarovar_title:0 "It's Called the Dwarovar!"
  az_an_its_called_the_dwarovar_desc:0 "The twisted mockeries of Grobilazk have ever haunted our shadows, ever preyed on our moments of weakness, ever hungered to overthrow our rightful dominion over the Dwarovar! Too many times have we been weakened by this menace - nay, by this scourge! - to the point that even our hold was almost brought low by the Chaingraspers and their wretched wizard leader! Enough. Let it be known from this day forth, that we, the Dwarves of Ovdal-az-An, shall finish what Aul-Dwarov could not.\n\nWith axe and sword, with musket and cannon, with spell and sling, let us march forth, Granite Dwarves, and purge the Serpentspine of all goblinoid filth! We shall torch their villages, slay them in their hovels, drive them into the streets and into the caverns and massacre them until the gutters overflow, running red with their blood! No mercy shall be had, no quarter offered, no goblin scum left alive! We shall destroy all traces of their people and cleanse the lands of holy Halanna forever more!\n\nOur armour is contempt! Our shield is disgust! Our axe is hatred! In the Pantheon’s name, §Rlet none survive!§!"
  az_an_we_will_not_fall_again_title:0 "We Will Not Fall Again"
  az_an_we_will_not_fall_again_desc:0 "The fall of our hold to the repulsive spawn of Grobilazk almost brought the Granite Dwarves low. But in their time of need, the true children of Dagrin were saved from the goblins by their kin, who, whilst ignorant of the true path of the gods, still did their holy duty and struck down their ancient foe, delivering us from destruction. Daily this is revered and remembered in the hold, for was it not divine providence that brought the outsiders to the gates, and Argezenna’s strength that was lent to their arms as they cleansed the goblin filth, and the wisdom of the Pantheon that allowed them to see the true light of the gods once more?\n\nYet we must not fail again. We cannot count on this beneficence from the gods a second time, and so the Fall shall never again be repeated. As our campaign of blood and fire within the Dwarovar continues, we shall build a mighty network of fortresses to stand guard. Not one outsider shall set foot in the Serpentspine lest we deem them worthy, and not one attacker shall ever reach Ovdal az-An again!"
  az_an_undeserving_of_us_title:0 "Undeserving of Us"
  az_an_undeserving_of_us_desc:0 "We, the most faithful and fervent servants of the Pantheon, are forever surrounded by heresy, by those who have lost their way, by those who would seek to cast us down! The vile filth of the surface world shall not be permitted into Halanna’s consecrated caverns, into Dagrin’s hallowed halls, into the righteous domain of the dwarves! We Granite Dwarves shall purify ourselves of the taint of all outsiders, and under our rule, the Dwarovar shall only be the domain of the holy servants of the gods.\n\nWhere once stood entrances to the Serpentspine shall now only witness great bastions of our faith, our defiance, our hatred for those who refuse to acknowledge our position as rightful guardians of all things dwarven! Any fools who would dare impugn the sanctity of our mountains will be met with the thunder of cannon, barking our response to any intrusion! Raise the fortresses of faith high! None shall pass into our sacred realm!"

  #Column 5, Part 1
  az_an_these_ancient_caverns_title:0 "These Ancient Caverns"
  az_an_these_ancient_caverns_desc:0 "Even in her long isolation, the archives of Ovdal-az-Ân maintained a painstaking record of the entire Tree of Jade, for there was once a time that Ovdal-az-Ân educated the dwarves of all the Empire. As we first travelled to this hold, we gained a practical knowledge of the region's geography, and from each new chamber of archival slabs we learn of another sealed ancient crypt or long-lost repository of dwarven knowledge.\n\nSuch places will not remain untouched forever. We should reclaim them and preserve them for posterity, the collective heritage of dwarfkind."
  #Part 2
  az_an_hjals_healthly_hold_hogs_title:0 "Hjal's Healthly Hold Hogs"
  az_an_hjals_healthly_hold_hogs_desc:0 "Many former adventurers from the time of the Axebellow Cartel know of Hjal, a simple farmer whose family maintained Hold Hogs for centuries, even after fleeing the Serpentspine. Hjal has restored the family tradition, now herding hundreds of the animals. The government offered Hjal an exchange; divert all produce to the state in exchange for a wide reach of caverns and an incredulous amount of wealth.\n\nOf the stories and exploits that fill our hold, none are more popular than that of Hjal, a simple farmer whose clan-tradition of raising Hold Hogs runs as deep as Ovdal-az-An. Humble, pious, and diligent, Hjal is storied to have not only survived an encounter with Dak Chaingrasper but also saved his clan’s herd of Hold Hogs. An account the farmer attests to divine intervention from Dagrin himself.\n\nWith our surroundings secured, there are many who are clamoring for Hjal to be elevated. They argue that both his hogs and his faith would form pillars for Odval-az-An to rest upon. Who are we to disagree?"
  az_an_faith_ale_title:0 "Faith & Ale"
  az_an_faith_ale_desc:0 "Faith and Ale go together like Dwarves and their grudges, or Goblins and Corpses! The reclamation of Hul-az-Krakazol and the rediscovery of Margurz represents this simple fact.\n\nAll dwarves, even the ancestralist fools, agree on one thing: ale is central to their experience. Indeed, it is the promise of higher-quality ale that has been known to win over some types of dwarf to the worship of the true Gods. Why is this? Because even the ancestor-worshipping idolaters account for the fact that faith and ale go together like a dwarflord and his grudges."
  az_an_twinned_tributes_title:0 "Twinned Tributes"
  az_an_twinned_tributes_desc:0 "The twins, Logrim and Logram, have been revered in our halls for years. They are the wardens of the dead, the eternal wanderers. But as they keep logs on all that dies, one thing falls not yet under their auspices: Granite Dwarf culture. Kept alive by none other than the legendary hero Goblinsbane. The twins and Goblinsbane, together they have led us to this point. It is time to commemorate their service."
  az_an_more_then_grudge_title:0 "More then a Grudge"
  az_an_more_then_grudge_desc:0 "Few are more degenerate than those hobgoblin enslavers and defilers—the scum that murdered the old Granite Dwarves and exterminated the ancient legacy of the Jade Mines, those venerable caverns meant solely for dwarfkind. As if that is not vile enough, the bastards also dare to suggest that all the gods, including our own, are dead or do not exist. They compound theft and oppression with blasphemy and enslavement.\n\nThe Command’s continued existence cannot be tolerated."
  #Part 3
  az_an_how_war_is_won_title:0 "How War is Won"
  az_an_how_war_is_won_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach. A saying immemorial, yet so often disregarded or forgotten. Dwarven lives, no matter their origin, are precious gifts, and should not be wasted by being forced to starve to death from lack of provisions! Therefore, we shall institute a comprehensive and regular logistics chain for our armed forces - we vow that not one Granite Dwarf under arms shall go hungry!\n\nThe Serpentspine offers unique challenges for logisticians, with its oft-hostile or inedible flora and fauna often meaning traditional methods of forage are risky or even impossible, particularly in the hostile caverns that comprise much of the region. Yet we have a solution - breeding ever more hold hogs in our cavern farms. The Tree of Stone is blessed with greater quantities of serpentbloom and other fungi than elsewhere in the Dwarovar, thanks to Halanna’s great gifts, and hold hogs are useful as both hauliers and being good for slaughter. With their bellies full and packs lightened, our soldiers can march ever onwards!"
  az_an_veterans_of_the_onslaught_title:0 "Veterans of the Onslaught"
  az_an_veterans_of_the_onslaught_desc:0 "Though dwarves’ lives are long, even the greatest of our kind must go to be judged for their actions in life by the Mother and by the Deathkeeper. Yet as long as their legacy survives, in a way, so do they. Though Goblinsbane, praise be unto him and the Pantheon for his holy defiance, is long dead, his memory and legacy lives on. His legendary exploits, his masterful ambushes and his fearsome charges, his butcher’s work of the goblins that once dared infest our sacred home, are like gospel to our generals, who seek to emulate his courage and daring in all their actions on the battlefield, and through their actions, Goblinsbane shall live for evermore. His words echo in lecture halls of stone and steel, and his battlecries renewed by thousands of young, hungry voices eager for battle and bloodshed."
  az_an_forward_base_title:0 "Forward Base"
  az_an_forward_base_desc:0 "The tale of Gor Ozumbrog, youngest of holds, is a sad one indeed. Betrayed by their kin, besieged by their once-allies and left to die at the hands of Grobilazk’s spawn, it does not fail to bring a tear to the eye of the most stubborn of Granite Dwarves. How could our people fall to such levels? How could Dagrin’s children slake their thirst for blood on each other, when the goblins and orcs had already laid us so low?\n\nThe Middle Dwarovar has shown their weakness, their lack of faith - nay, treason! Treason, we proclaim, against Dagrin! The Topaz Dwarves shall be shown the light and comforting embrace of the gods, and never again shall the treason of the Citrine Dwarves and their "Seg Band" be visited upon them, for they shall be the first of the Middle Dwarovar to see the light! And from there, we shall push onward, and with the blood of the Segbandal shall the sins of the Seg Band be cleansed. March on, Granite Dwarves - the lost children of the Middle Dwarovar call for salvation!"

  flavor_ovdal_az_an.1.a:0 "Blessed be!"

  flavor_ovdal_az_an.11.t:0 "Old Granite Life"
  flavor_ovdal_az_an.11.d:0 "Even after a twelve-hour shift, Anka comes to the house by the wickerworker's temple. Before the Sundering of 1439, all the craftsmen of this district gathered here once a week. Each took a bundle of dried cave fern stalks hoarded in their homes and offered them to Halanna.\n\nShe knows this because of Hâz, whose long grey hair flows like liquid over her back in the parlour of this dilapidated manor. Hâz insists that since she is no priest, she cannot enter the temple itself - she will not relent no matter how much the scholars plead.\n\nAnka has brought with her a large lidded clay jug of milk; she swaps it for an empty jug on the floor. She brings in a new blanket, a hairbrush. She lays the new blanket over Hâz's lap. The old one smells stuffy, like this place, shot through with an acrid tinge of urine.\n\n“My father would sit there,” Hâz says, and Anka smiles. She has heard this a hundred times. She knows that Hâz was forbidden to go upstairs in her own home until her father died, and that when the hold’s wards broke, Hâz thought it must be fireworks going off, some mishap at the Precinct of Celebration. Anka suffers through these retellings with a strained patience.\n\nShe begins to brush Hâz's hair, and as she does, a change comes over the old woman. An immense beauty inhabits her for which Anka can think of no name, save Halanna's light. Hâz speaks of festivals, of communion, of days when all of Ovdal-az-Ân breathed the same breath. In these few minutes, Anka forgets her exhaustion. She remembers why it is that her days are spent hauling rocks and dusting down granite and fetching after glorified mercenary captains. She remembers why this is all worth it.\n\nIn Hâz's quivering voice, Anka sees both the past and the future of this hold."

  flavor_ovdal_az_an.12.d:0 "Anka fights the urge to fiddle with her long, brown braid. It is not seemly for a priest.\n\nA dais has been raised at the centre of the Wickerworker's Plaza and she ascends it, her silver-grey robes brushing the ground as she walks. They are still unsure which god was venerated here alongside Halanna; this was not a prosperous area before the Sundering, one of the very first to drown in the goblintide. Her fingers nervously find purchase on a necklace beneath her robes - it belonged to Hâz.\n\nNo matter. Just as that addled crone showed her the light of Halanna, she must show others. The wisdom of the great goddess will reveal all else in time. A great throng has arrived, gazing eagerly upon Anka's little regiment of priests. All around the plaza, great dormitories and meeting halls have been restored or raised anew; chanceries flank neighbourhood kitchens, which serve as temporary lodging for new arrivals to the Hold.\n\nAlready today she has discussed restoration of a local archive, responded to a levy request from Argrâstun and chaired a planning session on the construction of a new civilian forge. Nothing happens here which does not at least pass under her glance. When a new impoverished clan group appears with nothing left, it is Anka who finds them a work detail, tries to keep them together, inducts them into their new local temple congregation. And in those moments when she doubts her own judgement, she remembers strange old Hâz, alight with the joy and wonder of Halanna herself."

Just earlier, historians, theologians, and archeologists rushed into the palace to discuss an unimaginable find: The Granite dwarves of old had also been followers of the Dwarven Pantheon, but even more, they were one of the few holds were that faith was still tolerated after most of the Dwarovar converted to Ancestor Worship. This means that we follow in one of the most noble traditions of dwarven culture now, and we will rebuild the faith in the name of our forefathers."

The whole room falls silent after our own diplomats counter with the mention of our Gods, and dinner is served in silence."

Before them lay a crypt, hewn from the granite, and within, an ornate sarcophagus carved with an effigy of a dwarven woman, resplendent in the robes and accoutrements of the High Priesthood of Halanna. A murmur of wonder echoes throughout the workers as they brush centuries - nay, millennia - of dust from the carved name at the foot of the effigy, all holding their breath as they are entranced by the suspense. It is her - it is Odna II, legendary High Priestess, and the worker of the Edict that kept the Hold of One safe from the heresies of the Dwarovar for so long. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sinks to their knees before the sarcophagus in reverent prayer, before nodding to a worker who slowly, almost reluctantly, opens the sarcophagus. The coffin inside is relatively simple by comparison, formed from roughly-hewn rock, but it is not the coffin that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seeks - it is instead the shining white metal rod that lies upon it.\n\nA hushed gasp emanates from all present, with a single word on everyone’s lips - Vûrodrmonir."

At first, there were some guards who gathered them up and threw them away, but soon the prints swarmed the capital hold, and soon hitched rides on the carts of overzealous dwarves to the other holds. Within the week, everybody had heard of the pamphlets and the gruesome, horrific story within.\n\n“From the Diary of a Dwarven Slave, Found in His Dead Arms, Impaled by the Command,” reads the title. It details life within a hobgoblin mining operation, where slaves labour day-in, day-out to carve from the rock the metal that the Hobgoblins need to wage their wars. The nameless prisoner explains with graphic detail the methods with which the slavers fulfill their quotas, and what happens when they can’t keep up with demand. It tells of how kobolds, goblins and dwarves sleep almost piled on each other, how they crawl through the caverns with barely any light or clothes. How death is always around the next corner, as the darkness and what dwells within threatens to kill whoever disturbs it.\n\nTowards the end, the dwarf embarks on a quest of revenge after another dwarf is executed for disobedience. They sabotage the operation, incite strikes and riots, poison food, until the Command has to step in to establish order. In the chaos, they escape into the caverns, but Hobgoblin patrols are right behind them. They flee west and south: Word has reached them of a new dwarven realm in the Tree of Stone. The text becomes more hopeful, almost exuberant in its prose. Then it stops.\n\nWhoever reads the diary knows what it means when the diary is finished. “Found in His Dead Arms”, the title foretold.\n\n"
