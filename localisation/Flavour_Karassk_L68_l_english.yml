 L68_our_favorites_title:0 "Our Favorites"
 L68_our_favorites_desc:0 "The halflings have always been the closest friends of all the lizardfolk empires and it's easy to see why. They are so much more compact than humans, which lets a great amount of them live in a small amount of space. They are naturally more docile than even the most well raised Khair. They are even friendly to the most barbarous creatures. They have however grown a bit cheeky recently; it seems they’ve stopped sending us tribute, no doubt as some charming prank. It was very humorous for the first couple of hundred years or so, but now the joke has run its course. It’s time to return and remind them of their obligations and perhaps a reprimand by revoking some privileges. Such fun!"

 L68_little_resistance_title:0 "Little Resistance"
 L68_little_resistance_desc:0 "Tsamanosy is now under our control but the halflings don’t really act like it. It seems the dictates of the Emperor go in one ear and head straight out the other. They seem rather upset that we chastised them by revoking their privileges and they have continuing to act as if they have them. Perhaps we weren’t clear enough the first time about the will of the Emperor being absolute Since they seem so lamentably forgetful, the Emperor has decreed that soldiers should be spread across the island, always ready to remind our subjects of their new status whenever it slips their mind. "

 L68_a_matter_of_courage_title:0 "A Matter Of Courage"
 L68_a_matter_of_courage_desc:0 "The great port of the southern island of Tsamanosy has proven a much greater boon than we had ever anticipated. With the Port of Teramazdai in our possession our trade has increased many fold. The Emperor is most pleased with this, but in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great wisdom [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] foresees an even greater role for the port. Of course, cultural exchange and trade are useful, we suppose, but the port is ideally built to become a new military hub. If instead of supporting trading vessels it instead supported and trained our dragoons, we could field so many more of them. With the port repurposed soon all the creatures of the sea shall obey the dictates of the Eternal Empire and its Emperor."

 L68_they_wont_mind_title:0 "They Wont Mind"
 L68_they_wont_mind_desc:0 "Now that the halflings once again respect our rulership and the plains are ruled by the lizardfolk once more, some halflings have arrived with a petition. They wish for us to restore their ancient cities on the mainland. We’ve decided to do them one better; we told them we’d move the cities themselves to be closer to our capital. They went wide eyed and said that we didn’t need to do that, clearly overwhelmed by our generosity, but we assured them it was no trouble at all. The Khair have said they have more than enough humans working under them to relocate the cities. Sensing that they still had some reservations, our diplomat promised that this would not end up like that time we accidentally destroyed a spire trying to move it – at which point one of the halflings fainted. Surely they are overcome with excitement at moving closer to their masters!"

 L68_family_matters_title:0 "Family Matters"
 L68_family_matters_desc:0 "The Khair families around the Azure pyramid are the descendents of various groups of humans from ancient times, like slaves and… well, mostly slaves. The majority of them can trace their ancestry back to neighbouring Horashesh, but some have ancestry from as far west as Fangaula, as north as Kheterata and east as Madriamilak.\n\nOur ancestors thought humans were an inherently destructive race, but we’ve learned that their culture was the culprit for much of that behavior; once we got rid of it and taught them proper civilized ways they became much less offensive. They do their best to imitate their betters, wearing special spectacles to make up for their innate colorblindness and many perfumes so as not to be so offensive to the nose. These days, they don’t even see themselves as humans, but our human subjects see them as human and that’s a good enough reason to put the Khair in charge of them. A few contrarians have raised concerns about the Khair being, as they put it, ‘entirely corrupt’, but it’s not like they’re going to be ruling over lizardfolk… how much damage can they really do?"

 L68_holes_in_the_map_title:0 "Holes In The Map"
 L68_holes_in_the_map_desc:0 "Though our empire is eternal and glorious that doesn’t mean that all of our ancestors were perfect… besides the previous leadership of course. When our ancestors ruled Horashesh, they saw the complete lack of civilization then present and perceived humans as a kind of innately violent lesser race, even hunting them for sport. It was an easy mistake to make but somewhat understandably the humans were upset with these practices. The modern humans seem to think we will also hunt them like our ancestors and have a great hate of lizardfolk. After the humans destroyed the Irikin lizardfolk because of this unfounded fear it’s clear a firmer hand is needed to keep them behaving.  If we want to reclaim Horashesh, we need to establish better routes into it. We must subjugate the tribal lizardfolk to secure our borders."

 L68_below_the_waves_title:0 "Below The Waves"
 L68_below_the_waves_desc:0 "We have been blessed by the Goddess Katesh and given dominion over the sea, yet some creatures refuse to obey our commands. Most notable among these are the ones that rather resemble a fish somehow bred with a human, as disgusting in person as it is in description. When we catch them in our nets they say things like “let us go!” or “please, I want to see my family!” which has given some people the false impression that they are intelligent beings. All it proves is that they are talking animals, like parrots or trolls. In the past we let such wildlife be, but now that our policies have changed it would be more beneficial to corral the creatures into the water underneath our shipyards. There they can be made to do undersea maintenance on our vessels, bringing us another step closer to ruling the oceans – just as the goddess intended."

 L68_a_matter_of_belief_title:0 "A Matter Of Belief"
 L68_a_matter_of_belief_desc:0 "Irikin Zatsarya, one of the holy spires, is once more under our rightful dominion. Settlers from the homeland have flooded into the area to be close to it. The Khair have moved the humans out of the area and now there’s ample room. With it under our control and with contact reestablished with the governors of Kunolo we believe it’s time to reassert our dominion over Dao Nako to protect the spire there. We have always believed ourselves to be the rightful protectors of the spires and with the Irikin reclamation, others cannot deny this truth."

 L68_little_faith_title:0 "Little Faith"
 L68_little_faith_desc:0 "The Naga still refuse to acknowledge our fulfilment of the prophecy, citing such petty concerns as “ravaging Taneyas” or being “entirely tyrannical”. There are some however who have yet to be poisoned by these perfidious naga –  the halflings. Very few of them understand the prophecy but those who do don’t particularly care about our past actions. We must ensure that these people are taught about our eternal mandate properly but most of the naga would feed them lies. Luckily the three eyed naga recognize the truth much more readily; let us send them to halfling communities and shrines so they may give the small folk a proper understanding."

 L68_armoring_up_title:0 "Armoring Up"
 L68_armoring_up_desc:0 "Dao Nako is once more under the dominion of the lizardfolk and what a boon it has been. The region is full of useful and exotic materials. Out of all the flora, one in particular stands above the rest: the iron trees. The trees share most of the same properties as iron, except for one we recently discovered. Our great sharks react badly to iron but not to ironwood. This has allowed us to finally begin augmenting our shark forces; teeth plated in steel, fins covered in armor. With this breakthrough the effectiveness of our sharks shall increase manyfold! Already a great foundry is being constructed at the site of the sunken Dao Nako spire. Of course, we also wouldn’t reject armor crafted by our subjects as an alternative tribute."

 L68_a_bigger_boat_title:0 "A Bigger Boat"
 L68_a_bigger_boat_desc:0 "While it’s never been illegal for a Khair to own a boat, to crew them with humans has always been frowned upon due to the humans deficiencies in the aquatic sphere. Crewing them with lizardfolk has also been frowned upon, as it necessitates lizardfolk taking orders from humans. As it turns out, halflings were the perfect solution. The difference between a halfling and a human is not so large as it is between a human and a lizardfolk which makes being commanded by a human less off-putting. As an added bonus, it’s also more efficient; the halflings are great sailors and they take up much less space than a human while being able to do about the same amount of work. This allows much more of the space to be dedicated to cargo and supplies. Now all we need to do is build the proper infrastructure on their island and learn about how their crews usually operate. Funny, with the smallfolks’ help, our shipments will be larger than ever!"

 L68_skining_a_cat_title:0 "Skining A Cat"
 L68_skining_a_cat_desc:0 "Hundreds of years ago the accursed khet humiliated our empire. They invaded Horashesh and separated it from our domain. After many long years of waiting at last we are ready to repay this humiliation, but how? The discussion rages: two very popular ideas are to raid their pyramids or burn their great library. A prominent naga mage has however recently outlined a third plan. If we could access the knowledge contained in their human thralls’ towers, then the mages could create a great storm to ravage the whole Sorrow.\n\nDubbed the ‘Sharkmaggedon’, this storm would carry our war sharks as well. Those on the water would be terrorized as hundreds of sharks tore them apart and those that fled to land would hardly be any safer. The magic will carry our sharks allowing them to leap out and maul anyone close to the river… which happens to be a supermajority of the Kheteratan population. Honestly, it probably won't hurt the khet themselves as they’re much too powerful to be threatened by some sharks. What it will do is make the humans recognize that we are the Sorrow’s masters, not the khet. With this threat hanging in the air we will take the khets’ empire from them permanently. Our other subjects would do well to pay attention to what happens to those who defy us."

 L68_demands_of_empire_title:0 "Demands Of Empire"
 L68_demands_of_empire_desc:0 "As expected of our glorious Emperor, the rebellion was swiftly crushed. Immediately a parade was organized, streets along the parade route were paved for the first time in a 100 years as a show of the Emperor's beneficence. Each soldier was paid in excess of what they were promised and even the peasants were given some gold from the spoils. The people got to witness live battles between captured rebels. At the center of it all was the Emperor himself, parading down the central avenue in his war gear and behind him bound in chains was the infamous bandit Riverjaw. Festivities carried on well into the night;  the Emperor declared  food to be made ready for the entire city, laughing when the minister of the economy questioned if they had the funds. Another sun sets on our glorious Eternal Empire."

 L68_barbarians_title:0 "Barbarians"
 L68_barbarians_desc:0 " “Gods, I hate Ikeshebe. My grandfather hated them too, even before they skinned him alive. Do you think I would be here in the wilds without good reason? Yes, the empire needs humans, no, it does not need these murderous animals! That’s why we’re here, to bring civilization to these stinking barbarians. Revenge? That’d be good, too. The Khair have already begun infiltrating the brutes. The war against these monsters won’t last long and when it’s done… we have plans.\n\n        - Captain Akro of the 4th Karrassian expeditionaries"

 L68_a_test_of_loyalty_title:0 "A Test Of Loyalty"
 L68_a_test_of_loyalty_desc:0 "The Khair families have been given control over the humans of the empire, but never before have they ruled over so many and especially not ones so completely devoid of civilization as the Ikeshebe. They’ve been instructed to go further than they ever have before in teaching these humans proper manners and civilization. This will be the greatest ever test of their abilities and loyalty to the empire. Many are reluctant to go and rule over them, much preferring to stay around the Azure pyramid in proper civilized lands rather than being forced to manage barbarians to whom they feel no kinship, but we will not send a lizardfolk to deal with those skinners. Regardless whether the Khair see themselves as lizardfolk, barbarians see them as human and that makes it much easier for them to tame these rampaging beasts."

 L68_a_destiny_of_sorts_title:0 "A Destiny Of Sorts"
 L68_a_destiny_of_sorts_desc:0 "The prophecy of the eternal 333rd empire is of utmost importance to all lizardfolk, even more so to we noble folk of Karassk who quite obviously fulfilled the prophecy a mere  500 years after the Day of Ashen Skies. Despite this, the naga cling to any reason they can to deny our claim. We are a pious folk and would never undermine the sacrosanct place the naga hold in society, but it’s most vexing that they won’t give us a clear answer on what they want out of us. Perhaps if we soften their hearts and mend some bridges between us they would be more cooperative."

 L68_clearing_the_coasts_title:0 "Clearing The Coasts"
 L68_clearing_the_coasts_desc:0 "Irikin Zatsarrya, the holy spire, is now ours once more. This will go a long way towards getting the naga to recognize us. Still in order to properly claim the spire we need to settle the area with lizardfolk which may prove a challenge as the humans are still there. There’s only one solution: the Khair must organize a migration of humans away from the vicinity of the spire. After all, what's the alternative, slaughtering humans indiscriminately to pave the way for a rebirth of Irikin culture built on their bones? You’d have to be possessed by a malevolent spirit to even consider it! In order to make sure the process goes smoothly they’ve requested the Emperor not intervene and that they receive a seat on the imperial council in return - so they can cut some of the red tape, naturally."

 L68_a_matter_of_strength_title:0 "A Matter Of Strength"
 L68_a_matter_of_strength_desc:0 "Humans have long been banned from being part of the imperial army but some Khair have found a way around that. Humans aren’t banned from the Iyashlagilla, the ‘barrier forces’ where they might take the brunt of charges for their betters. The Khair have thus recently taken some inspiration from the Bashiidi and formalized this process. The humans would be drafted like imperial soldiers into full human regiments – with lizardfolk commanders of course. The Khair have even offered to train and arm these forces from their own pockets to strengthen the empire."

 L68_salt_of_the_earth_title:0 "Salt Of The Earth"
 L68_salt_of_the_earth_desc:0 "At the center of our attempts to recolonize Horashesh lies lake Kuiziva. Though the clear water of the lake is beautiful, many of our settlers feel a sense of loss. They miss the light spray of saltwater coming from the sea. At the seaside we are facing a different kind of problem: our shark fisheries are at full capacity yet it’s still not enough to meet our demand. These apparently distant problems have the same solution – let us simply dump hundreds of tons of salt into the lake to make it into a shark fishery. Sure, it may kill all the sorghum grown around the lake, but only humans could eat that anyways."

 L68_zenith_title:0 "Zenith"
 L68_zenith_desc:0 "The sun rises again to greet the Eternal 333rd Empire and its glorious capital Karassk. All around lie the estates of powerful noble families and regional governors, in pristine condition as always.  Today, however, was special – today the Emperor summoned as many as could come for an announcement. Lizardfolk and Khair from across the empire marched through the well-maintained streets, passing by the modern houses. Soldiers were escorting them to make sure all of them were going exactly where they were supposed to. No one would dare miss this announcement. They would not dare."

 L68_pillars_of_sand_title:0 "Pillars Of Sand"
 L68_pillars_of_sand_desc:0 "Possibly the only true mistake we have ever made was when King Karaz VII Godseeker tried to move the spire of Azushal. The spire was destroyed and hundreds died as a result, and this has blotted our reputation in Taneyas ever since. We refuse to be indebted to anyone or anything; we must restore the spire and wipe the slate clean. If any could do such a work it is us. We have tribute from all of Sarhal to back our economy, and the Khair have impressed hundreds of thousands of humans into the workforce. The spire was a monument to failure, our failure. Now it shall become a monument to greatness, not just for lizardkind but for the Eternal Empire who rule them!"

 L68_greater_heights_title:0 "Greater Heights"
 L68_greater_heights_desc:0 "Before the centuries of rebellion our empire was vast and mighty but we have recently come to a realization. Even at its greatest extent in the past the empire was never as large as it is today. We were already worthy of claiming the prophecy back then, but now? There is no one alive who can deny our terrible power or our dominion over Sarhal. They used to laugh when we said we were the most glorious empire to ever exist – they aren’t laughing anymore. You wouldn’t even need a whole hand to count the number of nations that can rival our might. We are glorious, we are power, we are the 333rd empire and our name shall last until the very end of time."

 L68_more_modest_amount_title:0 "More Modest Amount"
 L68_more_modest_amount_desc:0 "Foreign auxiliaries have always been an integral part of our army. They are very useful, as our noble citizens have long since moved past the desire to go march in the mud. Still, we are perhaps overly reliant on these foreigners; they are foreigners, after all, and foreigners can never entirely be trusted. It would be not at all remiss if we made our army leadership better trained. A new leadership like this can create a more formalized path towards becoming a dragoon and help us cutback on the auxiliaries."

 L68_man_i_love_fishin_title:0 "Man I Love Fishin'"
 L68_man_i_love_fishin_desc:0 "Before the rein of our mighty Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] the imperial fisheries had become nearly unusable. A previous Emperor investigated why and found it was due to some malicious bureaucrats – luckily they were all found and punished on that same day so there’s no need for further investigation. Our Emperor, in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wisdom still sees ways to improve upon the work of their forebears. We have worked extensively on the fisheries, but what about the fishermen? We will supply them with tchoken to use as bait and build more boats for them. We can even send trainee dragoons along so they can get a better understanding of their future mounts."

 L68_fools_all_of_them_desc:0 "While not ever one of our colonies, it seems the city of Yassa requires our intervention. A baffling initiative in Yassa proclaimed that it would be a wonderful idea to make a council of the stupidest people in the city and give them control over policy. We sent people to investigate these rumors, as we reasoned that the ‘council of fools’ must be a euphemism for something else – but no, they have truly set up an idiocracy. How did they think this gaggle of morons would save them from the Baashidi barbarians? No matter, our spies are infiltrating the territory as we speak. The city of Yassa and the lands of the barbarians: we shall conquer them both."

 L68_a_matter_of_fear_title:0 "A Matter Of Fear"
 L68_a_matter_of_fear_desc:0 "As we reassert our authority over our former colonies and the helpless city of Yassa, we have been surprised at the resistance to our actions. They along with the inland cities say we have taken territory to which we have no claim. They are like ungrateful children. We built them, protected them, molded them and yet they still resist us. Oh well – it is no great loss. We made them and we can unmake them. We gave them their cities, and if they can’t appreciate that we’ll tear them down to expand our ever loyal capital. If they will not respect us out of love, then fear will have to do. All we care for is their loyalty and We. Will. Have it."

 L68_breaking_through_title:0 "Breaking Through"
 L68_breaking_through_desc:0 "We would be ready to assert our dominion over the eastern lands if it weren’t for the small issue of the entire Ardimya peninsula being in the way. This means that Lashuan City will have to take a great trip around the whole of Ardimya just to reach the eastern tributaries… hardly practical. We’ve hit upon a better way, though – we are masters of beasts and so we just need to get our beasts to dig a canal through the Ardimya isthmus. The merfolk beasts are especially suited to this task and we’ve already identified the perfect location. If we coordinate, blasting away ground with our mighty artillery while simultaneously having the beasts carry the rock away, this canal will be done sooner than most would believe possible. With such a canal, tribute collection in the eastern lands will be many times more efficient!"

 L68_recognize_us_title:0 "Recognize Us"
 L68_recognize_us_desc:0 "Many lesser nations have claimed that we were never the 333rd Empire and that we were deluded. We wonder what they think now. Our dominion now encompasses the near totality of our race. From one side of Taneyas to the other we are the sole rulers. Never was there a more complete empire, save perhaps those barely remembered polities in ancient times. Now we must ask again, are we not the Eternal Empire? Do we not rule over lizardkind? Are we not mighty? They called us deluded but anyone who could look upon our dominion and say that we are not the empire of prophecy is the most deluded of all."

They hide away in deep, obscure places but they cannot remain hidden from us for long. We’ll dismantle their great burrow piece by piece and bring it to our capital. It shall make the capital more splendid and beautiful then we had ever previously imagined. They cannot hide – the goddess’s mandate shall not be disrespected."

Not even the Khair worship us but these people are so quick to recognize our superiority. Their awe only grew when they saw our dragoons riding in on great sea beasts.

It is in fact so large now that it’s starting to become a problem. The Karassian sea is becoming clouded from all the refuse in Lashuan and it’s making it difficult for the nobles to raise their sharks. We could cut Lashuan down to size but it seems such a waste and it would grow again soon enough. Rather the Emperor has a most brilliant solution. We shall bind all the ships together and get the mightiest sharks to pull it. Now our administrative center can go wherever it needs to while the Emperor gets to overlook the clear blue sea."

They dared to claim it as their territory, which is only really to be expected of those never taught proper civilised ways like the Khair – but to give it to the merfolk!? Were they mad? The merfolk are animals and the Baashidi simply handed it over to them for safekeeping. This is the utmost disrespect for an empire that once sacrificed everything to save lizardkind.

 flavour_karassk.1.desc:0 "The sun rises again to greet the Eternal 333rd Empire and its glorious capital Karassk. All around lie the estates of mighty noble families and regional governors, some a tad rundown –  their owning families are off doing important work, you see, and haven’t been back in a few… generations. Today, however, is special: today is the crowning of a new Emperor. People gather all around from their open air housing, a new fad for those seeking to be less materialistic and recycle more. Increasingly, many have been forgoing living in houses at all! They make their way across the dirt roads, a naturalist fad, escorted by soldiers to make sure no one gets lost on the way to the imperial palace, where their new Emperor is being crowned.\n\nThe Emperor looks upon his fellow lizardfolk and many Khair humans – the Eternal Empire exists of course to rule lizardfolk, but long ago it was discovered that when humans are raised in the proper manner, they too can be worthy of the same honors as a lizardfolk peasant. He clears his throat before beginning. “Loyal subjects, I accept this honor and swear to be worthy of this most glorious Eternal Empire. Now, I will admit my predecessor erred in some ways, for one some lizardfolk in the city of Karshyr disagreed with his policies and they’ve begun to violently protest. Moreover, to the north some bandit warlord, I believe his name is Riverjaw, is trying to wrest control from the local administration. I assure you, you have nothing to fear, my subjects, the imperial army has been mobilized and these issues will be dealt with swiftly.”\n\nThe crowd showed their enthusiasm with rapturous silence."

Over the years there’s been a policy of deficit spending to grow the economy, but some of the creditors are getting a tad impatient. Some worry-warts have dubbed it ‘reckless spending’ or an ‘economic death spiral’, but do they truly think the Eternal Empire is like some gambler helpless when the debts come due? They forget we can always send a few soldiers to remind these people of their loyalty. Still, we did recently subdue some rebellious cities; perhaps they can be ‘taxed’ to make up for their rebellion. The profits can go towards getting those merchants to finally cease their chattering."

 flavour_karassk.3.desc:0 "After being paraded around since his capture, the bandit warlord now awaits judgement. As it turns out his name is actually Riverclaw, Katyradz Riverclaw. The naga seem to love his brother Sykar for some reason and claim preposterously that he will create the 333rd empire. It is bad enough that the naga refuse to acknowledge our plainly obvious fulfilment of the prophecy, but to promote some jumped up tribal and his band of hut dwellers to Emperor and royal courtiers is a sad symbol of decline. Katyradz seems to have a massive brother complex, he sulked off to Asarta and tried to coup our glorious empire in order to one up Sykar!\n\nThis would be amusing, if it wasn’t for that meathead Sykar and his barbarian loving younger brother Aryalgaz sending their hooligans around, telling good citizens of the empire that Sykar will forge the Eternal Empire. Normally a traitor like Katyradz would simply be executed, but there’s an opportunity here. Sykar seems to still love his brother and wants us to return him to the jungle village they’re calling their ‘capital’ – in return he promises not to attack us, as if he could threaten the Eternal 333rd Empire. Alternatively we could send him to Aryalgaz and let Katyradz poison him against Sykar, which would be very amusing. We should probably just kill him, although for some reason the soldiers seem nervous at the prospect – do they seriously fear the retribution of some jungle muck dredgers?"

They made their way through the great port into the countryside, their destination a town that was home to a lord who ruled over a sizable portion of the island. As they arrived in town, they expected to find a reception party but the town seemed strangely empty. The doors were all locked. It seemed like the halflings must all be out on some work project, probably to our glory, and missed the delegation’s arrival. Oh well – a proper celebration could be organized later. Regardless, we knew the local lord, whose manor was now in view, would still be home. The lord and his servants greeted the delegation warmly before inviting them inside; the delegate began the conversation by reminding the lord that their tribute was overdue by roughly 100 years.\n\nThe lord gave a nervous chuckle and asked how they were enjoying Tsamanosy. The delegate asked him to remain on topic and asked about the tribute once more. The lord said that it must’ve gotten lost in one of his predecessors’ bureaus, but by reducing some tariffs… the delegate saw that the long years of autonomy had made the halflings forget their place.\n\n“Stop,” he said. “You still haven’t answered when you’ll render the overdue tribute”. The local lord fidgeted, before finally responding - “What would you have us do?”\n\nThe delegate responded “Well, for starters…"

The city of Nazhni seems to have ambitions of becoming a sort of independent trading hub and is disregarding our rightful dominion. They ought to be punished for this insolence, and will in due time, but Khugra is a much more obvious case of what happens to a city without our guiding hand. They’ve been divided into three parties. The Red Party seemed to like that warlord Katyradz, until he fell before us of course and now they swear loyalty to us – we know they’re fairweather friends at best. The Green Party wants to submit to the naga lap-tchoken, General Mudsling, in Rayaz. The Gold Party seems to think that by joining with Nazhni,  the two colonies can somehow make something of themselves without us. Regardless, it’s time to reform the administration of these regions. We are the obvious rightful rulers of the region and there are still those within the colonies who have not forgotten their true loyalties."

The naga are all trying very hard to smile. The Emperor sits down and exchanges some pleasantries with the gathered naga before getting down to the issue at hand. The Emperor asks why the naga refuse to acknowledge Karassks fulfilment of the prophecy. The naga seem deep in thought and their faces making strange expressions that almost reminded the emperor of a scolded butler.\n\nOne naga begins to speak. “Well, it’s…”\n\n“Yes?” the Emperor inquires.\n\n“Yes, it is just…”\n\n“What is it.” the Emperor asks again, frustration creeping into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice.\n\n“It’s because… you have yet to reclaim the western spire!”\n\nThe rest of the naga all nod in agreement.\n\n“Yes that is quite right,” another one adds, “Your empire will never fulfil its destiny until the western spire is under your control.”\n\n“Oh,” the Emperor responds, “Well, why didn’t you say so? That’ll be no issue at all.”\n\nSatisfied, the Emperor and his entourage leave. All at once, the naga seem to exhale."

Perhaps it is because of our new training regimen, which is much stricter as to ensure our dragoons are truly the best. Yet we hear concerning reports that trainee dragoons are constantly being pressured to head into the depths of the sea to try and ‘find the goddess’. Far from some Nanshyn superstition, in practice this seems like a kind of hazing ritual where new recruits pick fights with the meanest sea monsters they can find. Recently, reports have been coming in about a clash with a giant sea serpent. They describe the trick to fighting it as ‘moving as the serpent does’, though how a shark and a lizardfolk are meant to be capable of moving like a serpent is left unexplained. Still, perhaps we should refrain from cracking down on this behavior, if it is truly honing such powerful dragoons..."

Most recently, a group of young dragoons confronted a colossal squid. Though it wields no magic, this legendary beast can destroy an entire warship with its strength and is so large it preys on whales. The battle against such a creature was ferocious and many recruits were crushed but our dragoons were ultimately victorious. The corpse of the beast has been dragged to the port where the local halflings prepared a great feast from its remains. The beak of the monster has been sent as a gift to the Emperor – proof of our dominion over the creatures of the sea."

The naga are so impressed that their mouths hang open in stunned silence. One looks at the Emperor in… fear? No, of course not, it must be awe. Not only that, but Irikin Zatsarrya has been restored. Once more the Emperor asks the naga about the prophecy, but they still seem reluctant. Are they really still dragging their tails after all we’ve done?\n\nSome of the Emperor’s bodyguards tighten their grips on their spears, at which point one of the naga entourage speaks.\n\n“My liege, while the restoration of Irikin Zatsarrya was certainly necessary, there’s another western spire. The one sunken into the dirt – that one must also be restored”. The Emperor looks at them for a second before letting out a chuckle, that would be even easier than the last task!

Their task is to move the rock out of the way, even as boulders fall around them – the monotony and strain of the work causes many of them to lose their edge. Sometimes they don’t notice a rock headed straight for them before it’s too late to get out of its way – the sickening crunch snaps their fellows out of their stupor for a little while. Over time the silt and blood begin to darken the water, staining it red gray and brown. After so long it feels like days, though logically it must be much shorter, the horn blasts and signals the end of their task, which they accept mutely as when they received it. They mourn silently as the great sharks pull them away. Above the waves there is a roar of applause from the artillery crew.

It is true that Karassk has spilled much lizardfolk blood, the empire has broken many humans. The sea beasts were dominated no matter how many lizardfolk lost their lives in the attempt. No matter how hard they tried they couldn’t stop questioning what it was all for. Their hands were shaking, was this… guilt? They slapped their own face and closed their eyes before doing some measured breaths – they had to remember what it had all been for – the prophecy. The Empire's territory had returned to what it was before its small contraction, the humans once again obeyed the natural authority of Karassk and the Empire was the true master of the creatures of the sea. Everything [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had done was justified, everything [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had done was necessary and if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] needed to do it all again, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would.

Specifically they are here to educate the people about the prophecy, as these people have been erroneously taught that the prophecy has not been fulfilled. The soldiers are here to correct that misconception. Any citizens who still don’t understand Karassk’s fulfillment of the prophecy are led by the soldiers to private tutoring sessions, where it is all explained to them.

With all the dragoons’ training and their fine equipment, it would be a disservice to call the ensuing events a battle; the beasts never had a chance. Their glass structures were shattered and their coral dens were smashed apart beneath our titanic sharks. The greatest challenge of the whole operation was simply finding them all, but for our men even that didn’t slow them down for long. Before six hours had passed, the burrow was emptied of its animals. As many as possible were captured, though some of the sharks were in too deep of a frenzy to go after the odd escapee."

He had been taught that the lizardfolk were monsters by nature, but now he realized it was worse than that. He had been around enough lizardfolk to realize they didn’t have to do this – these people were monsters, but not by nature; they had chosen this. He glanced up the endlessly receding black surface of the spire, one that he had been told was once destroyed; in places the uniform basalt was broken up by gaudy marble inlaid with gold and emerald.\n\nThere were reliefs along every level; one showed a lizardfolk whipping an Ikeshebe, the man down on his knees, fingers curled in pain and mouth frozen in a silent scream. Another showed a crowd of protesting lizardfolk being gunned down by the imperial army, the soldiers laughing as the crowd fled in terror.\n\nThe one he hated the most was three levels up. It showed a dragoon skewering a merfolk prince. The cruel expression on the dragoon's face and the dying choke of the prince were captured forever in imperishable gold. The lizardfolk loved it – for some reason they thought it made them look good – the Khair also loved it. Hemiunu had heard the Khair fervently deny that they were humans and he was starting to agree. The carving was finished, built into the sandstone at the base of the spire. Here were inlaid the actual bones of various enemies of Karassk, crushed up and turned into a grand relief depicting Karassk’s history. He was in the 'present’ section.

As it has floated off the shore in the Sea of Karassk it grew, eventually becoming an essentially independent settlement - now the majority of the vessels making up the city are under control of the Emperor. Now the city sails the open seas, pulled by giant sharks, the ships keeping settlers, administrators, and dragoons. It sails flying the red and black sails to directly intervene on the Emperors behalf while Karassk remains the seat of imperial power."
