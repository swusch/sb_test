 cannor_religious_flavour.1.t:0 "The Festival of Vows"
 cannor_religious_flavour.1.d:0 "The Festival of Vows is upon us. Ryala, the blessed goddess of love and beauty, is honored by the jovial festival. A renewal of vows between lovers both in private and in public is followed by a procession of said couples throughout the streets of our capital. Donning their finest attire, devoted couples, young and old, rich and poor, are cheered on by onlookers during this celebration of Ryala's divine blessing of love. This parade lightens the heart of all our subjects as surely as the following feast fills their bellies. The festival provides an opportune time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to show [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] as a paragon of devotion for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people. How should the sovereign celebrate?"
 cannor_religious_flavour.1.a:0 "Renew your vows in front of the court as a symbol of love."
 cannor_religious_flavour.1.b:0 "Throw a magnificent feast for the lovers."
 cannor_religious_flavour.1.c:0 "Celebrate privately."
 cannor_religious_flavour.1.e:0 "As a devotee of Ryala, our love is shared with all."

 cannor_religious_flavour.2.t:0 "Beauty Celebration"
 cannor_religious_flavour.2.d:0 "As she climbed the stairs of the makeshift stage, the seemingly-endless sea of eyes nearly brought her to her knees. Fighting through the weakness coursing through her legs, she maintained her practiced stride, graceful yet purposeful. \n\nThis was the moment. \n\nThis was the Beauty Celebration of Divine Ryala, her chance to prove her virtue to the world. \n\nThe rest of the day passed in a blur. The performance. The waiting. The selection of the Chosen Women of the Temple. \n\nAnd now she lived her new life. She had been deemed worthy of a place amongst the ranks of the Ryalan Temple. One of several women each year that were deemed worthy to serve both her people and her faith. Women who won this honor did not always stay behind the temple gates, some rose to even greater heights."
 cannor_religious_flavour.2.a:0 "Let our ruler take her for himself."
 cannor_religious_flavour.2.b:0 "She would make a perfect advisor."
 cannor_religious_flavour.2.c:0 "This woman might as well be an avatar of Ryala herself!"
 cannor_religious_flavour.2.e:0 "Women must stick together in today's world."

 cannor_religious_flavour.3.t:0 "Lovelost Woes"
 cannor_religious_flavour.3.d:0 ""Since time immemorial the marriage rites of Ryala have been held sacred. Overseen by a member of the clergy and formal in their structure, the ceremonies of wedding your partner under the auspice of Ryala symbolized the greatest commitment one could make to another. A commitment so steeped in the traditions of ancestors past that adulterating these rites is an affront to common decency itself. However, it seems the brazenness of these new Corin worshippers knows no bounds, for they have eschewed these time-honored ceremonies." - Dominic of Badeben, Treatises of the Lovelost Schism \n\n "Blah, who are they to tell us what to do? I love her and she loves me, that is that! What worth are stuffy vows and kneeling thrice or whatever dull rituals they require, when our love is in our hearts? We are married anyhow, no matter what some pompous priest may say!" - Devan of Charwic, as recorded on the day of his wedding \n\nThe Lovelost Schism is the name given to the theological debate surrounding the rites of marriage. These arguments have now spread to [Root.GetName], how should we deal with them?"
 cannor_religious_flavour.3.a:0 "Beauty and love should be afforded to all regardless of circumstance."
 cannor_religious_flavour.3.b:0 "Changing the rites would be an affront to Ryala herself!"

 cannor_religious_flavour.4.t:0 "The Ciresian Sisterhood"
 cannor_religious_flavour.4.d:0 "The Ciresian Sisterhood started as a secret society of women who interpret the femininity of Ryala as a rejection of the patriarchal structure of the Regent Court. With the Corinite faith bringing a female deity to the forefront of the pantheon, this once underground society has begun preaching their subversive ideas out in the open. Testimonies that the female experience is essential to the true understanding of our faith and that the feminine divine is being shackled by traditional societal roles have spread like wildfire in [event_province.GetName]. These concepts have particularly resonated with the middling stratum of our subjects. Wives and daughters of merchants, doctors and lawyers are now convinced that they should no longer be confined to the tasks of child rearing and homemaking activities and are disrupting the status quo in some of the most productive professions in our lands."
 cannor_religious_flavour.4.a:0 "Shut down any of this crazy talk."
 cannor_religious_flavour.4.b:0 "Support this laudable cause."

 cannor_religious_flavour.5.t:0 "The Dragonfire Balgarites"
 cannor_religious_flavour.5.d:0 "Balgar the Builder, the dwarf-turned-god who gave us such wonders as the Walls of Castanor, has once again turned his eye towards war. With Corin leading the Regent Court, new engines of war are needed to spread the true faith, and Balgar has bestowed such terribly ingenious machines on his loyal Dragonfire followers. These followers of Balgar have seen the righteousness of Corin's cause and have devoted their engineering prowess to share her truth. Should this be in the form of siege engines, or more domestic concerns?"
 cannor_religious_flavour.5.a:0 "Let's deploy their latest war machine."
 cannor_religious_flavour.5.b:0 "Focus their ingenuity on construction instead."
 cannor_religious_flavour.5.c:0 "Hire the Balgarite leader for our armies."
