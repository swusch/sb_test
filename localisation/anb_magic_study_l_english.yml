 magic_study.2.d:0 "After painstaking effort, countless failed spells and incantations, and uncountable hours of reading every available tome in sight, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has finally gained the understanding needed to advance their magical prowess. Arcane knowledge and mystical techniques zip through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind like lightning through a storm cloud, exploding into clouds of potential energy harnessed by a single rod of mastery. With this newfound gift of excellence, all the struggles and hardships needed to reach this point finally prove their purpose, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ascended to even greater heights.\n\n[Root.GetMagicStudyUpgradeSchool]\n\n[Root.GetMagicStudyUpgradeLevel]"
 magic_study.2.a:0 "Onwards! Again and again!"
 magic_study.3.t:0 "Heir Magical Thesis"
 magic_study.3.d:0 "The finest resources for scholarly learning have gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName], and together they have instilled a true magical talent into [Root.Heir.GetName]. Our goal to secure our legacy through instruction and guidance has proven to bear fruit, as [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] begins to demonstrate magical potential. With the future of [Root.GetName] finally safeguarded, we can now reflect on what has been accomplished, and where we shall proceed from this moment.\n\n[Root.GetMagicStudyUpgradeSchool]\n\n[Root.GetMagicStudyUpgradeLevel]"

 magic_study.4.a:0 "Onwards! Again and again!"
 magic_study.5.t:0 "Estate Magical Thesis"
 magic_study.5.d:0 "Countless court mages have passed through the halls of [Root.GetName], each bringing new ideas and experiences to the minds and pages of all spellcasters in the land. Through the collective effort of these experts in the strange and mystic, countless more treatises and essays have been published on the advancement of magical thought. And with the unfathomable effort of the innumerable masses devouring the ceaseless tide of literature, a glimmer of light has emerged from the sea of scholarly work; the advancement of magic yet again. The mages cheer, celebrate, and return to their desks, picking up their books once more to discover where the next limit lies.\n\n[Root.GetMagicStudyUpgradeSchool]\n\n[Root.GetMagicStudyUpgradeLevel]"
 magic_study.5.a:0 "Onwards! Again and again!"

 magic_study_abjuration_desc:0 "Abjuration magic has a primary focus on wards, both for static defense on key structures and mobile armaments designed for personal protection or motion. The defensive nature of the school marks it as the perfect tool for those under siege, or who plan to fight much greater foes than themselves. Possessing these tools will greatly help [Root.GetName]."
 magic_study_conjuration_desc:0 "Through Conjuration, we are able to summon a variety of different things to the material plane, from elemental soldiers to supplies for the army or construction. Improving our summoning techniques will be key to keep our armies large and well fed, and [Root.Capital.GetName] spectacular and beautiful."
 magic_study_divination_desc:0 "Using our improved Divination techniques, we can now see further into the future and better understand the movements of our enemies. With this boon, our security in times of crisis is assured, and we can rest easy knowing our foes will not trouble us before we trouble them."
 magic_study_enchantment_desc:0 "Through our increased Enchantment prowess, we may augment [Root.GetName] and its natural treasures to be stronger and more effective, while also bringing others into line through willpower alone. Soon, we will shape everything into our vision of what could be."
 magic_study_evocation_desc:0 "With Evocation, we may now lay waste to our enemies, with balls of fire and empowered fury. None can stand against the raw power we now possess, and any who try will be flattened by sheer might. We possess the fury of the elements- challenge us if you dare!"
 magic_study_illusion_desc:0 "Our new potential in Illusion will allow us to trick even more adversaries. By projecting a powerful image of force, or a calming scene to soothe the masses, we will maintain our control and frighten those who stand against us. With a subtle touch, we can do whatever we desire."
 magic_study_necromancy_desc:0 "With new advances in Necromancy, our ability to control the energy of life is stronger than ever before. Taking it for ourselves, stealing it from the masses, or even raising an undead host seems within our reach. With our newfound power, we are unstoppable!"
 magic_study_transmutation_desc:0 "The study of Transmutation allows us to shape scores of different objects into wildly different forms. Plants from dirt, small to large, anything is possible with our newfound powers. Some day, we may even turn lead to gold. The world is ours to shape, and so we shall!"

 magic_study_legendary_desc:0 "After all this time, it is finally complete. There is no further study to be done, and nowhere else to go. We have reached the apex of magical power, and have firmly placed ourselves among the titanic figures of the mages of the past. All shall hear our name and tremble in awe at our magnificent glory. There is only one question left- where do we go from here?"
 magic_study_renowned_desc:0 "We have become notable in our practice, our talents whispered in the halls of nations far and wide. This is a remarkable achievement, but it is not yet the pinnacle. To ensure our dominance in the magical world, we cannot stop yet. The boundary must be expanded- we will continue!"
 magic_study_proficient_desc:0 "This is only the beginning of understanding. Painstaking hours await us from this point, in pursuit of knowledge, technique, and so much more. There is only one way forward for us: continue in our search, and drive magic within [Root.GetName] to even greater heights."

 magic_study.101.b:0 "I don't need your help!"
 magic_study.102.t:0 "Delve Into the Archives"
 magic_study.102.desc:0 "Archival research is a key part of any magical study. The most talented of mages might be born with great gifts, but when training one's skills it is a safe bet that the path has been trod before. Rather than grasping and groping in the dark, those who seek to advance their arcane prowess beyond the most elementary level ought to consult the teachers of ages past. There are great libraries across the land, some with rare tomes that would no doubt be invaluable to advancing our magical prowess. We should send a delegation forthwith, the only question is where to?"
 magic_study.102.a:0 "A bit rich, isn't it?"
 magic_study.102.b:0 "The Academy of [8.GetName]!"
 magic_study.102.c:0 "The [275.GetName] Imperial Archives!"

 magic_study.103.t:0 "Ancient Tome Uncovered!"
 magic_study.103.d:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have managed to procure an ancient tome that may help with our magical studies. However, it appears to be written in an uncommon [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] dialect which could take years to translate. Until it is, we won't even know if what we have is valuable!"
 magic_study.103.a:0 "Nothing a couple scholarships can't solve!"
 magic_study.103.b:0 "The mighty [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will translate it [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]!"
 magic_study.104.t:0 "Magical Relic Located!"
 magic_study.104.d:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our informants have located a magical relic that may help with our magical studies. However, it lies in a perilous location which may prove some difficulty in retrieving."
 magic_study.104.a:0 "Send some $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$"
 magic_study.104.b:0 "Time for the $ESTATE_MONSTROUS_TRIBES$ to prove their worth!"
 magic_study.104.c:0 "The mighty [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will undertake this dangerous quest!"
 magic_study.105.t:0 "Precursor Knowledge"
 magic_study.105.d:0 "It is known that within the bounds of [precursor_relics_province.GetName] lie ancient relics from the Elven Precursors. The magical knowledge they held was immense, and a close examination of the artifacts they left behind would no doubt be invaluable to our magical research. So far, our delving into their secrets has been limited to what relics we have been occasionally been able to purchase from the market or uncover from ruins, leading some to propose more... organized extraction measures. However, such actions might prove disruptive to the local economy and ecology, and the locals might not be pleased. Not to mention the risk, however slim, of 'explosive backlash' from toying with forces beyond our control."
 magic_study.105.a:0 "Send an expeditionary force. Keep the locals in check."
 magic_study.105.b:0 "Send a research team. Make sure nothing blows up."
 magic_study.105.c:0 "Are such measures truly necessary?"

 magic_study.106.t:0 "Magisters Offer Aid"
 magic_study.106.d:0 "The Magisterium offers aid, from magical tutors, papers and artifacts, if we agree to share any reasonable findings in addition to greater powers within $COUNTRY$."
 magic_study.106.a:0 "The Magisters know best!"
 magic_study.106.b:0 "A welcome display of fellowship!"
 magic_study.106.c:0 "Draft a reply. Mention 'unprecedented breaches of sovereign privacy'"
 magic_study.107.t:0 "Magical Practice"
 magic_study.107.d:0 "Sometimes, all it takes is some hands-on experience in order to reach new heights of magical prowess."
 magic_study.107.a:0 "We can spare the mana"
 magic_study.107.b:0 "You won't lay a hand on my magical fluids!"
 magic_study.108.t:0 "Magical Practice Failed!"
 magic_study.108.d:0 "We must have had less mana than thought, because our spells fizzled on first contact."
 magic_study.108.a:0 "I swear, this never happens..."
 magic_study.109.t:0 "Magical Study Drags On..."
 magic_study.109.d:0 "It is said that inspiration is achieved when preparation meets opportunity. In order to fuel continual bursts of inspiration, we require the resources to sustain that preparation. Whether it be a new set of tools for magical research, or simply the time and space to think, we have found ourselves wanting for additional resources in our academic pursuits. We should redouble our efforts in order to reach new heights of magical prowess."
 magic_study.109.a:0 "Pour resources into research!"
 magic_study.109.b:0 "We can be economical about this."
 magic_study.110.t:0 "Unregulated Research"
 magic_study.110.d:0 "What, really, is a "best practice"? Who determines it? Why is it followed? These are questions no one seems to ask. Here is another question no one asks: what is the cost of following these so-called "best practices"? A slothly speed of advancement, countless invaluable enlightenments left undiscovered. A benighted realm, sluggishly dragging itself through the quagmire of ignorance. No longer shall we be held to the autochthonous "best practice", that ignoble past-ism which dresses itself up in the language of safety. Ours is the endeavor of the future!"
 magic_study.110.a:0 "Let us cut the red tape."
 magic_study.110.b:0 "Who is saying this? Fire them immediately."
 magic_study.111.t:0 "Unregulated Research: Unsafe Experiments"
 magic_study.111.d:0 "A report from the [Root.GetAdjective] safety board: A rupture in a heat exchanger from the latest experiment conducted at the Royal Academy resulted in the release of several unsafe elements, including aqua regia and offgassed quicksilver. One operator sustained serious chemical burns, and a fire broke out resulting in waste of process materials, unquantified spillage, and general health and safety risks posed to lab assistants. The Safety Board recommends an immediate work stoppage..."
 magic_study.111.a:0 "What is this tomfoolery? Away with it!"
 magic_study.111.b:0 "Process safety is invaluable..."
 magic_study.112.t:0 "Unregulated Research: Living Test Subjects"
 magic_study.112.d:0 "Though magic across Halann takes many forms, and is governed by many rules and traditions, one taboo persists almost everywhere: the use of sapient beings for experimentation. In the Lake Federation, this sin brought down the Tyrant Queen; in Cannor, it is banned by the Magisterium by punishment of summary execution. Despite this, we're sure that we will learn much more seeing the effects of our spells on more... appropriate subjects."
 magic_study.112.a:0 "Abduct some sorry souls for research"
 magic_study.112.b:0 "Mind control some 'willing' subjects"
 magic_study.112.c:0 "A preposterous proposal. Out of my sight!"
 magic_study.113.t:0 "Test Subjects Exposed!"
 magic_study.113.d:0 "A large mob approaches your holdings and demands answers over your recent research involving illegal living test subjects!"
 magic_study.113.a:0 "Assuage their concerns"
 magic_study.113.b:0 "Send a force to teach them a lesson"
 magic_study.113.c:0 "You are my subjects. Mine."
 magic_study_mod_live_experiments:0 "Magic Study: Exposed Live Experiments"
 magic_study.114.t:0 "The Talent and the Tutor"
 magic_study.114.d:0 ""Talented as you may be," Court Mage [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] begins, "Talent is no guarantee of supremacy. What will you do when you are older, and the expectations of talent are traded for that of performance?"\n\nThe [Root.Heir.GetTitle]'s eyes flash before responding. "I do not need you. I do not need this magic. I am not some lousy weapon to be spent again and again. Blood rusts the blade." [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] leans back in [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] chair, only to be disciplined via the swift application of a ruler across the wrists.\n\n"I have a dozen students," responds the tutor, "and eleven of them will practice spells until their mana expenditure grows dangerous." [Root.Heir.GetName] nurses [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] stinging hands. "Eleven will peruse any tome given, no matter how esoteric. Eleven would leap at the chance to be given fieldwork such as this, to put down a revolt in the name of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Do you believe yourself so invulnerable that they will not surpass you? The crown is no invincible artifact."\n\nImmediately, [Root.Heir.GetName] lunges forward sharply at the implicit threat. "I will kill you! I will bury a blade in the small of your back--and it will be a mundane dagger, and you will die all the same."\n\nIt is rare for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to be summoned when dealing with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Heir.GetDaughterSon]--the privilege of grand living is the right to have others care after one's progeny. While normally commending the young [Root.Heir.GetTitle] to the care of tutors, on this occasion a firm parental hand might be required."
 magic_study.114.a:0 "Issue bribes of sweet-meats if the [Root.Heir.GetTitle] behaves."
 magic_study.114.b:0 "In this household, we do NOT threaten tutors with assassination! Issue a punishment!"
