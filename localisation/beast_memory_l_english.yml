beast_memory.2.t:0 "Sojourn"
beast_memory.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], accompanied by a slowly thinning crowd of loyal retainers and servants, solemnly proceeded out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat of power into the wild. Here [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could get in touch with the noble beasts whose memories form the foundation of the exalted way of life that sustains [Root.Monarch.GetName]. One by one, the warriors and other followers take their leave or are dismissed until eventually the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own at a parting of ways. Now the decision cannot be delayed any further: where will [Root.Monarch.GetName] go?"
beast_memory.2.a:0 "Why, the brushlands, of course."
beast_memory.2.b:0 "Surely the jungles are best."
beast_memory.2.c:0 "I'd better seek out the open plains."
beast_memory.3.t:0 "Search for Sustenance"
beast_memory.3.d:0 "At long last, [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] destination. To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] embarrassment, which would no doubt be greater if [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage were still around, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stomach suddenly rumbles loudly. Examining [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] surroundings, [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes courage, as there are many opportunities to sate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hunger. Off in the middle distance, deer are going about their day, unaware of the two-legged predator close by. Near [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet, rabbits are running around. The nearby trees promise a bounty of ripe, wholesome fruits. With such varied options, what shall be the meal of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
beast_memory.3.a:0 "The lean rabbits."
beast_memory.3.b:0 "The tender deer."
beast_memory.3.c:0 "The succulent fruit."
beast_memory.4.t:0 "Bedding Down"
beast_memory.4.d:0 "With a full belly after this flavourful meal, [Root.Monarch.GetName] feels the need for rest approaching as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] yawns in a manner usually reserved for only the busiest, most exhausting days of work as a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A bit of unsteadiness on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet makes it abundantly clear that the time for sleep is near. However, since these are not [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] comfortable quarters, a proper resting place must be found first. A nearby thicket, a large tree, and a water hole come to mind as [Root.Monarch.GetName] wearily looks around. As grogginess sets in, where shall the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] get a good night's rest?"
beast_memory.4.a:0 "Behind a large thicket."
beast_memory.4.b:0 "Under the shade of a great tree."
beast_memory.4.c:0 "By the refreshing water."
beast_memory.5.t:0 "Returning Home"
beast_memory.5.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is welcomed back home by a slowly growing crowd of loyalists and servants, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] solemnly returns from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] journey to take on the ancestral wisdom of the exalted beasts whose blessings have aided [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people as long as they have thrived in these lands. Eventually the triumphant [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] returns home to the cheers of the exultant citizenry. The elders and shamans carefully observe the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] cloaked in the hazy shade of..."

beast_memory.7.t:0 "Celebrate Festival"
beast_memory.7.d1:0 "Brave, wise, and noble is the Mongoose! With tooth and leap and claw it defends all that is entrusted to it, driving away the darkness and the predators that would have their way with its turf. Bold and ambitious, it chases away venomous vipers and cobras as a broom sweeps away dust. With charisma and pride it serves as an exemplar for all those that wish to broadly expand their domain, leading from the frontlines to establish peace.\n\nAbove all else, o [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], emulate…"
beast_memory.7.d2:0 "Wise, noble, and brave is the Leopard! Though its prey and foes may range far, the wise Leopard is always two steps ahead, motivated by its ferocious hunger. Though the enemy may try to get away, in the end, through cunning and calculation, the Leopard will always get what it wants. Though the prey may seem to gain the upper hand, though a foe may back the Leopard against a wall, through a strength born of intransigence it will neither bend nor break!\n\nAbove all else, o [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], emulate…"
beast_memory.7.d3:0 "Noble, brave, and wise is the Elephant! The wise and loyal Elephant would rather let the whole world betray it than betray even one of its fellow creatures. Though the decisions may be difficult, the right path shrouded in fog, the noble Elephant will decide impartially and selflessly—it will find the path of least resistance for all. Though a foe may threaten all the noble Elephant holds dear, it will not surrender nor give in: it will protect its beloved to the very end!\n\nAbove all else, o [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], emulate…"

beast_memory.10.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Has Gained an Animal Companion."
beast_memory.10.d:0 "Though the days of all children of the Sky-Headed Beast living in one tribe are long in the past, it is known that sometimes a bond forms between children of disparate tribes, be they human or otherwise. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has formed such a bond with one of the beasts of the land, who now sits aside them as kin. It is surely a sign of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s holiness."
beast_memory.10.a:0 "A bond for life."

 beast_memory_religion_desc:0 "Those who follow the memory believe in the kinship of all creatures and that in the ancient past an alliance led by three Heroic Beasts slew the wrathful creator god. They venerate their ancestors and the spirits of the ancient beasts through rituals and a respect for life. Some adherents of the memory gain the power to shapeshift into powerful forms that emulate one of the three Heroic Beasts, a power which they can use to great effect."
