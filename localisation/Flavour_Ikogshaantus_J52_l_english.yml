 J52_1_3_friends_among_splinters_title: "Friends Among Splinters"
 J52_1_3_friends_among_splinters_desc: "As much as we take pride in our burgeoning industry, the inadequacy of our military has not gone unnoticed. To the south lies the state of Zabutodask, which although certainly lacking in economic skill, is famed for their superior military. Although the days of the federation are long past, our diplomats still believe that we have something to gain from the sister peoples of the lake. In exchange for some of our industry, we can tempt Zabutodask into becoming an ally."

 J52_1_6_hitting_the_archives_title: "Hitting The Archives"
 J52_1_6_hitting_the_archives_desc: "Ours is a disjointed people. The Khamgunai have never known the entire truth of their origin, only fragments. That our ancestors migrated from a luscious land, that they were a pious people who used the teachings of Enuuk to raise grand cities from the barren soil of Yarikhoi. It has always been the dream of the Khamgunai to reconnect with the fated land of Enuuk and the city-builders, wherever it might be.\n\nWith our conquest of Nuzurbokh came connections with the strange peoples beyond the eastern mountains. But among the winged women, emaciated ogres and hill-dwelling trolls, were those fellow humans who called themselves the “Rünsukhi,” who preach of a god similar to our own Enuuk, and who speak a language strikingly similar to our own. To our joy, it is clear that these people are also descended from the fated city-builders. The dream of the Khamgunai is not dead! It is time we dive deep into all our archives and tomes to discover our origins once and for all."

 J52_1_8_congregating_threads_title: "Congregating Threads"
 J52_1_8_congregating_threads_desc: "Many among our ranks have called for the peoples who now inhabit our ancestral lands to be chased off and replaced with our settlers, but to do such a thing would be a mistake. For among them too are the descendants of the city-builders, who may assist us in the restoration of our former monuments. Even if they have no relation to us, as our contact has deepened, so too has our understanding of the myriad array of useful skills and magics at their disposal. Of course, utilizing those skills will not be without cost – but we can pay it with our newfound wealth."

 J52_1_9_the_return_title: "The Return"
 J52_1_9_the_return_desc: "Kashlaalg, a land once unknown to us, has garnered a familial spot in the hearts of our people.\n\nHow they hunger to return to their ancient homeland! Such a migration would be chaos, however, if we have not dealt with those existing states that inhabit it. Their barbaric militaries must be quashed, their foreign administrations must be removed, and their chieftains and tribesmen must be neutralized, and then our people may finally return."

 J52_1_10_whispers_of_wonder_title: "Whispers of Wonder"
 J52_1_10_whispers_of_wonder_desc: "There are some fools among us who claim that our industrialization will soon reach its limit, and that our nation cannot rapidly expand indefinitely.\n\nThe fools! If the right hand of Enuuk is hard work, her left hand is ingenuity. It is time we focus on our mages, tragically overlooked by the Sanadazjal, for they are a wiry and innovative group who may yet be able to guide us past the hurdles ahead."
 
 J52_1_13_domination_title: "Domination"
 J52_1_13_domination_desc: "Look at the enemies that gather, eying our wealth with greedy eyes: they are right there, scheming to plunder our hard earned work. It is known that Enuuk hates thieves most!\n\nAnd so we must seek protection – and we know the way to get it. It is a harsh solution, but a necessary one. Domination – first over the masked nomads, then over all the decadent nations of the world who lust for our perfection."
 
 J52_1_15_the_anvil_of_haless_title: "The Anvil of Haless"
 J52_1_15_the_anvil_of_haless_desc: "Iron is the future; every new technology incorporates it somehow. Few remember the days without iron, but even fewer know – truly understand – that those days may soon return if our nation grows at its current rate. If we are to become the anvil of Haless, we must ensure the iron to forge this so never runs out – if we are to embrace the future, we should do so wholeheartedly!"
 
 J52_2_2_lighting_the_forges_title: "Lighting The Forges"
 J52_2_2_lighting_the_forges_desc: "The metallurgy of the Khamgunai has always been famous for its focus on quality and durability. For eons, that has satisfied local demand, but nothing more. But as we begin to reorganize our economy, it has become clear that the current production of these tools are woefully insufficient. It is time we strengthen the capacity of our crucibles and forges to enable our industrial dreams to become reality."
 
 J52_2_4_of_artists_and_artisans_title: "Of Artists and Artisans"
 J52_2_4_of_artists_and_artisans_desc: "The culture and arts of the Khamgunai suffered greatly under the decadence of the Lake Federation. For centuries, we attempted to emulate the artistry of the other peoples of the lake, but no longer. Under the dutiful watch of the Sanadazjal, all manner of artistic artisanry will be realigned to fit the expected standard of Enuuk, and with this rebirth, the Sanadazjal are certain the Khamgunai will enter a golden age of culture."
 
 J52_2_5_khamgunai_legacy_title: "Khamgunai Legacy"
 J52_2_5_khamgunai_legacy_desc: "Eons ago, our ancient ancestors crossed into the rich, albeit empty land of Yarikhoi and constructed its first cities. But their days are long gone. First came the Day of Ashen Skies which devastated the land, then came a millennia of stagnation under the Lake Federation. It is a testament to the skill of our forebears that our ancient cities still stand.\n\nIf we are to follow the path of our pious ancestors we must first rebuild their cities, the last beacons of their legacy."
 
 J52_2_7_beyond_the_mountains_title: "Beyond The Mountains"
 J52_2_7_beyond_the_mountains_desc: "As the Rünsukhi legends tell us: the prosperous land of the city-builders sank under the sands long ago. And of their glorious culture, only we and the decadent Rünsukhi remain.\n\nBut we are undaunted in the face of these tales – the Rünsukhi believe the heights of our ancestors forever lost, but we know that through labour, anything is possible. Beyond the mountains lies the lands of our ancestors, and if we are to rebuild it, and reclaim our glory, we must first reconquer it."
 
 J52_2_8_industrialized_army_and_navy_title: "Industrialized Army and Navy"
 J52_2_8_industrialized_army_and_navy_desc: "The Khamgunai have never been known for their military. But, as it is said: the hands of Enuuk touch all things – all our general efforts at industry have proven to be an unintentional boon for the army. Our soldiers wear better armour, their provisions stocked, ready for war, and our navy benefits from the bustling dockyards of our cities. The top military advisors of our realm tell us that we must redouble our efforts, and take a more targeted approach on using our industry to assist our military – if we do so, we may yet build the greatest forces Yarikhoi has ever seen."
 
 J52_2_11_mysticworks_machineworks_title: "Mysticworks, Machineworks"
 J52_2_11_mysticworks_machineworks_desc: "Enuuk is a goddess always willing to adapt, to learn from others. As we have delved into the ruins of Nomsyulhan, it has become clear that our ancestors were not the only race to once inhabit this newly reclaimed part of our homeland – the oft reticent Hobgoblins have told of a group of immortals who, like our predecessors, had an affinity for great constructs. Our exploration of the land has proven their stories valid, so we must commission our mages to further investigate the genius of these foreign innovators."
 
 J52_2_14_urbanization_title: "Urbanization"
 J52_2_14_urbanization_desc: "Some say our new cities will sink back into the sands like those of our ancestors. Worry not! What our precursors build from stone, we shall build from our hardest metals.\n\nEnuuk never built anything which did not last for eternity, and as we follow in her footsteps, so too must we build both tall and strong, our cities shimmering and untarnished, and achieve an immortal urbanization!"
 
 J52_3_1_new_beginning_title: "A New Beginning"
 J52_3_1_new_beginning_desc: "In order for the future to come, the past must be kept in its place. The Lake Federation has failed to achieve what is best for our people, and must be cast into the past if we are to claim a future for ourselves."
 
 J52_3_2_consecrated_crafts_title: "Consecrated Crafts"
 J52_3_2_consecrated_crafts_desc: "Enuuk is the goddess of creation, of the forger and the sculptor. All the Khamgunai seek to create works worthy of her satisfaction, but we are not a perfect people. Historically, we recognized this reality and in ancient times we formed the Sanadazjal, a group of retired but experienced artisans, laborers, and artists who take it upon themselves to judge whether a work is truly worthy of being presented to society. Our traditional clergy are incapable of this task on the scale we now desire, and by replacing them with the Sanadazjal, our nation will gain the tools to draw ever closer to the wishes of Enuuk. "
 
 J52_3_3_the_guilds_and_goddess_title: "The Guilds and Goddess"
 J52_3_3_the_guilds_and_goddess_desc: "The merchant guilds are key to achieving Enuuk’s vision, but we can only gain so much from them through cooperation. Only by conquering the remaining centers of guild influence among the Khamgunai can we take the final step: integrating the guilds fully into our administration, granting them representation and uniting their abilities with those of the Sanadazjal."
 
 J52_3_4_forging_ahead_title: "Forging Ahead"
 J52_3_4_forging_ahead_desc: "It is one thing to perfect past techniques, but another entirely to embrace the innovations of the present and future. Enuuk is the goddess of creation, and she bid our people not to remain attached to old things, to superfluous tradition. By updating our forgeries to contemporary standards, we can tie our burgeoning military with our dynamic system of industry."
 
 J52_3_5_lake_control_title: "Lake Control"
 J52_3_5_lake_control_desc: "The religious confusion of recent years has proven to us that our unification of the Khamgunai must not just be a political one, but a religious one as well. Rival religions have established themselves among our people, and only a strong reaction can eliminate them. The Sanadazjal are versatile, and eager to adopt more traditional clerical roles."
 
 J52_3_6_ever_expand_the_workshop_title: "Ever-Expand The Workshop"
 J52_3_6_ever_expand_the_workshop_desc: "We have seen the Sanadazjal transform from an ailing and obscure group to the forefront of our nation’s progress. But recently there has been some anxiety about the future of the organisation: much of our land in Yarikhoi has been consecrated, and the rest is soon to follow. What shall be their future purpose, once the job is finished? For now, though, our task is not rededication, but expansion. For the sake of the Sanadazjal, we must now fully integrate Nuzurbokh into our administration to allow for its future consecration."
 
 J52_3_7_agriculture_guilds_title: "Agriculture Guilds"
 J52_3_7_agriculture_guilds_desc: "It is a testament to our efforts in Nuzurbokh that few Khamgunai remember the olden days of strife, when the dual threat of food and centaurs paralyzed our people. The Urmanki and Orachav have proved an unbelievably effective asset for our new territories, allowing their agricultural yield to grow unburdened. But alas, this is no excuse for complacency. By giving additional privileges to the people of Nuzurbokh, and investing further resources, we can ensure our people will never hunger again!"
 
 J52_3_8_foundations_of_an_industry_title: "Foundations of An Industry"
 J52_3_8_foundations_of_an_industry_desc: "The more we observe the Anarkhudi, the more they surprise us. Even with the harshness of their terrain, the dearth of their resources, and the simplicity of their tools, the Anarkhudi have managed to create truly impressive cities atop their desolate land. Indeed, what was previously assumed to be only a race of barbarians has revealed itself to be another strange scion of the tremendous will of the city-builders.\n\nWhat may emerge from a large-scale collaboration with these people? The possibilities are tantalising – no doubt, they will only move us closer to our goal."
 
 J52_3_9_smog_atop_the_lake_title: "Smog Atop The Lake"
 J52_3_9_smog_atop_the_lake_desc: "Our fishermen have been complaining incessantly of how smog is covering their old fishing spots. Do they not understand? That smoke is from our industry; that smoke is the breath of Enuuk! The purest expression of our devotion, her power!\n\nIt is the dream of all Khamgunai – when all lands are consecrated, Enuuk will wreathe the very world itself in smoke."
 
 J52_3_10_begin_the_rebuild_title: "Begin The Rebuild"
 J52_3_10_begin_the_rebuild_desc: "The centuries-long wait of the Khamgunai is finally over. The occupiers of our ancient homeland vanquished, and our long-lost brothers given life under our rule – and now, all that is left to do is rebuilt. First must come the initial investment, but after that? The evolution of a once barren land will begin."
 
 J52_3_12_the_escalation_protocol_title: "The Escalation Protocol"
 J52_3_12_the_escalation_protocol_desc: "How many great artists died when making their masterpiece? How many empires grew decadent right as they were beginning to create unimaginable wonders?\n\nOur nation is one brimming with the enemies of creation: those who wish to see our nation buried once again by the sands of time. Our advisors have thus created the “Escalation Protocol,” a complicated idea from afar, but one with a simple premise: we must utterly transform ourselves, wrest ourselves from the decadent forces of history, and desperately hurry towards our great dream. For Enuuk! To Enuuk!"
 
 J52_3_13_acceleration_title: "Acceleration"
 J52_3_13_acceleration_desc: "Faster, faster, faster. Why do they not understand? Our bureaucrats and politicians stand in our way. Laws, they dutifully, dully cite, merely following dead procedure – do they not realise they sound like the men of the old federation? There is only one law: the law of Enuuk. And she has decreed the act of acceleration: to exceed the forces which chase us towards ruin!"
 
 J52_3_15_khantaar_restoration_title: "Rünsukhi Restoration"
 J52_3_15_khantaar_restoration_desc: "The great project to restore the old homeland of the city-builders is close to done, yet even our half-finished skyscapes take the voice away. They are a monumental, living, thing, as if Enuuk herself blew the breath of life into them, and they demand we finish them."
 
 J52_3_16_wrath_of_the_machine_title: "Wrath of The Machine"
 J52_3_16_wrath_of_the_machine_desc: "We have done it. The world holds its breath at our every action, for our nation has become the most powerful in all of Halann. Most of our empire is consecrated, carefully tweaked by the Sanadazjal until it can be considered truly perfect. In Kashlaalg, the land of our ancestors is reborn, and beautiful cities stretch to the horizon.\n\nAnd despite it all, Enuuk has not returned to her people. Clearly, there is still much to be done, and the Sanadazjal have begun to research into even more esoteric and arcane matters. But they need more – more money, more resources, more men. So let us build ever higher, keep consecrating until every last corner of our empire is perfect, and become the masters of the world – and finally reach our goddess."
 
 J52_4_2_raising_the_hammer_title: "Raising The Hammer"
 J52_4_2_raising_the_hammer_desc: "Our state has grand dreams, but we possess insufficient land and resources due to our small size. We must first establish our military dominance over the mainland if we should hope to legitimize our claim as the unifiers of the Khamgunai, and give us the security to expand further eastward."
 
 J52_4_4_fuller_stomachs_title: "Fuller Stomachs"
 J52_4_4_fuller_stomachs_desc: "Under the inefficiencies of the confederation and the yoke of the centaurs, the farms of the Khamgunai have long been inadequate, outdated, and harrassed. But now, both limiting factors are gone, and our people have no excuses left to give to goddess Enuuk. The land of the centaurs is fertile, but it is wild and untamed. Subduing and administrating the land of Nuzurbokh will be a challenge, but one whose reward will be a boon for generations to come."
 
 J52_4_5_urmanki_homesteaders_title: "Urmanki Homesteaders"
 J52_4_5_urmanki_homesteaders_desc: "Nuzurbokh is a hardy land, and its settlers, known as the Urmanki, are a hardy people. But before these intrepid frontiersmen lies a monumental task: to remove millenia of centaur influence, to cleanse the land and make it productive once more. But a monumental task requires monumental resources – it is clear they could use some of our help."
 
 J52_4_8_breaking_into_the_iron_trove_title: "Breaking Into The Iron Trove"
 J52_4_8_breaking_into_the_iron_trove_desc: "The land of Nuzurbokh is rich in the iron which our people have been sorely lacking in for centuries. As new metallurgical techniques diffuse into our lands from the west, and our scholars pour over reports, make predictions, adjust their conceptions of what is within reason, they are beginning to realise just what is possible. It is clear that if the resources of Nuzurbokh are properly harnessed, the Khamgunai shall not fall behind, but shall instead be propelled into the forefront of innovation!"
 
 J52_4_11_formalize_the_geomancers_title: "Formalize The Geomancers"
 J52_4_11_formalize_the_geomancers_desc: "The trolls have proved to be useful tools in our quest to rectify our glorious past. A normal troll can do the work of ten men, but their geomancers, the mages attuned to the earth, can do the work of a hundred. Unfortunately, their cooperation with us is scant and their physical methods are primitive. Perhaps, with some aid from us, we can convince them to join the Sanadazjal as a guild."
 
 J52_4_14_conglomeration_title: "Conglomeration"
 J52_4_14_conglomeration_desc: "Enuuk has many fingers, many more than a mortal man could comprehend. But we are not a “mortal” nation; our goal is exceptional and extraordinary – the emulation of our goddess! All crafts and arts must be mastered, unified, harmonized – conjoined, into a glorious and industrious conglomeration."
 
 J52_5_3_upward_and_onward_title: "Upward and Onward"
 J52_5_3_upward_and_onward_desc: "The land of Moduk is ripe for the settling of our people, but the wild forests, teeming with spirits of all kinds, are undeveloped and isolated from our core regions. By integrating the east into our ever-expanding trade network and establishing outposts along the coast, we can more easily encourage the movement of Khamgunai colonists to this rich land."
 
 J52_5_5_land_to_be_exploited_title: "Land To Be Exploited"
 J52_5_5_land_to_be_exploited_desc: "To call Moduk vast would be an understatement. We have heard stories of men travelling for weeks and still being met with the same unending woods and wily natives. Naturally, this immensity makes governing the lands we hold, and adequately providing for our efforts to settle new ones, much more difficult. For the full colonization and exploitation of this land to be possible, we will have to establish a capable and permanent administration."
 
 J52_5_7_upward_expansionism_title: "Upward Expansionism"
 J52_5_7_upward_expansionism_desc: "Roads cross and towns dot the formerly uninhabitable forests of Moduk. This land is quickly becoming ours, but it still remains an economic backwater. For the Sanadazjal to take an interest in Moduk, we must develop the foundations of industry in the deep forests of the north-east."
 
 J52_5_9_cold_colonies_title: "Cold Colonies"
 J52_5_9_cold_colonies_desc: "Many Khamgunai, accustomed to the volcanic warmth of their homeland, would consider working in the icey land of Moduk a grotesque punishment. But the Urmanki are not so. This versatile people has migrated into Moduk in droves, unsullied by the harshness of its lifestyle. Enuuk rewards those who suffer hardship for opportunity, and it would be uncouth of us to disregard the growing prosperity of Moduk."
 
 J52_5_13_proliferation_title: "Proliferation"
 J52_5_13_proliferation_desc: "The faithful are few and the barbarians are many. They claim that their religions, that they try to peddle in our lands, are righteous, right. We know most of them are lying.\n\nHow terrible! But the devout of Enuuk are never to be unestimated. We must expand our faith – consolidate the faithful into the bright land of our ancestors – enrich them so they may outpace the heathens: to achieve the widest proliferation of Enuuk’s worship!"
 
 J52_5_15_the_jewel_of_haless_title: "The Jewel of Haless"
 J52_5_15_the_jewel_of_haless_desc: "Many in Haless still scoff at our nation: they say that in our relentless pursuit of industrialization, we have forgotten the finer things in life. They are not incorrect – perhaps we have forgotten that despite all her laboring, Enuuk is the most lovely of goddesses.\n\nLet us build an industry of beauty, and soon our detractors in Haless will be eclipsed by our glory!"
 
 #Events
 ikogshaantus_events.1.t: "The Guilds and The Goddess"
 ikogshaantus_events.1.d: "When the world was young, Enuuk came down from the heavens to teach our young people. It is said that every day she would descend from her lovely stone-hewn palace in the high mountains, to spend her time among those who showed the most commitment to her craft.\n\nBut times have changed, and millenia of decadence have not treated the gifts of Enuuk well. Only one scion remains: the guilds. Even in legendary times, our people were numerous and Enuuk could not assist them all individually. So the guilds were organized – those who worked with Enuuk would head each guild, and would spread their learnings to the underlings. This ancient structure has persisted, and the most talented artisans remain the leaders of the guilds.\n\nBut the guilds of today are weak and ignored organizations, their tradition seen as anachronism. No longer: $MONARCH$ has extended his hand to them, offering them a place in the government. Once again, the guilds, and by extension the will of Enuuk, shall be enshrined within Khamgunai society."
 ikogshaantus_events.1.a: "From Enuuk we came, to Enuuk we shall return."

 ikogshaantus_events.2.t: "An Exchange of Favors"
 ikogshaantus_events.2.d: "Under the Lake Federation, the three peoples engaged in the worst kind of parasitic laziness, feeding off each other rather than striving to build off their own labour, causing a collective, foolish decline into decadence. With the Federation dead, some have proposed that we reforge our relations with our sister peoples, albeit into an equal and reciprocal form.\n\nIn the old days, the Zabatlari were always the primary defenders of the Federation, although they had little capacity for much else. The state of the Zabatalari in the south, Zabutodask, has carried on this legacy, and their armies are infamous. This has caused some anxiety among our people, as the Khamgunai have never been great soldiers. Some believe that Zabutodask will try to invade us – they say that because their army faces a chronic deficit of valuable bronze needed for war materiel, which we have in abundance, they seek war to rectify their situation.\n\nFortunately, the bonds created by the Federation may be dead, but this does not mean the peoples of the lake need to compete among themselves. In exchange for military protection, we could offer the people of Zabutodask our bronze artisanry."
 ikogshaantus_events.2.a: "Enuuk often dealt with the other Goddesses of the Lake!"
 ikogshaantus_events.2.b: "There is no need for this."

 ikogshaantus_events.3.t: "An Offer from Ikogshaantus"
 ikogshaantus_events.3.d: "An envoy from Ikogshaantus arrived today, offering us high quality bronze in exchange for military assistance."
 ikogshaantus_events.3.a: "Agree to the deal."
 ikogshaantus_events.3.b: "Tell the envoy to go away."

 ikogshaantus_events.4.t: "Zabutodask Accepts"
 ikogshaantus_events.4.d: "Our envoy to Zabutodask returned today, telling of the graciousness of the people of Zabutodask and the kind treatment they received. Their sovereign was quick to agree to the deal and claims this will assist them greatly."
 ikogshaantus_events.4.a: "Great!"
 ikogshaantus_events.4.b: "That feels a little too enthusiastic…"

 ikogshaantus_events.5.t: "Zabutodask Refuses"
 ikogshaantus_events.5.d: "Our envoy to Zabutodask returned today in tears, telling of the harsh treatment they received from the barbarians in Zabutodask."
 ikogshaantus_events.5.a: "May their skies be filled with comets!"

 ikogshaantus_events.6.t: "Call To Arms"
 ikogshaantus_events.6.d: "Under the Lake Federation, the three peoples engaged in the worst kind of parasitic laziness, feeding off each other rather than striving to build off their own labour, causing a collective and foolish decline into decadance. With the Federation shattered, some have proposed that we reforge our relations with our sister peoples, albeit into an equal and reciprocal form.\n\nUnfortunately, our country is a pariah among the other states of the lake, many of whom still cling onto the old ways. This has created some anxiety among our people who believe that our fair country is liable to be invaded at any time by some jealous outsider. Luckily, an opportunity has presented itself for us to bolster our military forces. Recently, a group of Orachav from Zabyos-tlar have offered us a deal: in exchange for liberating their homeland from its backward rulers, they promise that they will be a loyal ally to us. Though they do also have an additional request – for us to give them much of our bronze, their preferred metal of choice for their weapons, which are in short supply."
 ikogshaantus_events.6.a: "Enuuk often dealt with the other Goddesses of the Lake!"
 ikogshaantus_events.6.b: "There is no need for this."

 ikogshaantus_events.7.t: "Friends Among Splinters"
 ikogshaantus_events.7.d: "The Orachav that we made a deal with have declared the creation of a new state in the south. They accompanied us during our conquest of the region, assisting us as local guerillas, and when the previous administration was defeated, they set to work negotiating with local leaders and bureaucrats, hastily constructing a functioning government. And as a final act of defiance against the old regime, they have recently publicly executed many of its top politicians and governors, declaring the beginning of a new golden age for the Zabatlari."
 ikogshaantus_events.7.a: "This will be the start of a fruitful relationship."
 
 ikogshaantus_events.8.t: "The City-Makers"
 ikogshaantus_events.8.d: "In an unremarkable room by the lakeside, three representatives stand before $MONARCH$. With the recent unification of the Khamgunai people, it has become apparent to the influential players of the realm that $MONARCH$ has plans to move the capital to a far more significant city than the one which they reside in now. Of the many cities which sent delegates hoping to petition $MONARCH$, only three have been allowed to precede to this informal meeting: Kovtalzar, Qarshtuluu, and Zurkanrek.\n\nOf the three, the plenipotentiary from Kovtalzar is the most dignified – he dresses in simple traditional robes and talks in the soft accent of eastern Khamgunai. He gives a short speech summarizing the long history of Kovtalzar, being sure to remind $MONARCH$ that Kovtalzar is the first and most ancient city of the Khamgunai. Finally, he presents a simple amber pendant to $MONARCH$, the representation of the city’s prized gemstone industry.\n\nWhen the delegate from Qarshtuluu steps forward, one can hear the sound of one thousand scintillating gemstones. They have dressed in an elaborate outfit which covers most of their body and obscures their face. They speak of the opulent palaces, the prismatic towers, and the great libraries of their home city. After they finish their speech, they genuflect, and hold up a glittering sword – their gift to $MONARCH$, and say that it is the blade of Avakirmiin, a legendary Khamgunai warrior.\n\nFinally, the man from Zurkanrek begins to speak. He has not the assurance of the others; He speaks of the future, not the past. Zurkanrek is a city that has only grown into prominence in recent years, having used the influence of the Treasure Fleet to transform itself into one of the primary ports of the lake. His gift is the largest of the three: a nephrite vase onto which foreign symbols have been carved – and housed within lies a miniature tree bearing golden fruit. He says it was carefully negotiated from the most recent treasure fleet, and was produced over decades by master botanists in Yanshen.\n\n$MONARCH$ is careful not to indicate their position, and with the offerings complete, the three delegates can only wonder: who will be chosen?"
 ikogshaantus_events.8.a: "Kovtalzar, the first city"
 ikogshaantus_events.8.b: "Qarshtuluu, the richest city"
 ikogshaantus_events.8.c: "Zurkanrek, the upstart city"
 
 ikogshaantus_events.9.t: "Tied Hooves"
 ikogshaantus_events.9.d: "Of the many camps in Nuzurbokh, the one called Iinacslodhar is the largest. The core of the settlement is a trading post located along a river which runs through the centaur heartlands. A casual observer would be unaware of this, for surrounding this original collection of buildings lie kilometers of ramshackle huts and tents vaguely reminiscent of traditional centaur designs.\n\nAfter all, Iinacslodhar is one of many encampments which have arisen over the past few decades, as the remaining centaurs of Nuzurbokh attempt to escape the overbearing authorities of the land, and the hordes of Urmanki settlers. Centaur society in Iinacslodhar is an uncertain and fearful one, a byproduct of the countless laws restricting the traditional migratory lifestyle. Soon, as all its inhabitants know, Iinacslodhar will be seized by some eager group of colonists, and they will have to retreat further inland and further west. The centaurs of Nuzurbokh are trapped, unwilling to abandon their ancient homelands, yet unable to defend against its quickening erosion.\n\nThe cycle of life in Nuzurbokh is an unsustainable one, and all of its inhabitants wait for the government of Ikögshaantus to make a final decision."

A poor farmhand in Yarikhoi could come to Nuzurbokh and soon come to preside over tracts of rich farmland, as it is said.\n\nSuch optimism is misplaced.\n\nTo the east lies a chain of unnamed mountains, which cast a long shadow over Nuzurbokh. These mountains can be seen by all in the new frontier, and despite their mundane appearance, many have said that they were constructed by Enuuk herself at the beginning of creation. \n\nFor beyond these mountains is a venerable land, whose people speak a language so achingly familiar, but just beyond our comprehension. And they speak of a great cataclysm, which transformed their formerly prosperous land into a barren waste. And they claim that below the sands lie the marvelous cities of old, constructed by a grand race of city-builders.And they claim that people was guided by a motherly spirit in the skies.\n\nSuch allusions should strike fear into the heart of any Khamgunai, for it is clear that Enuuk has made her presence known. Nuzurbokh was given to us by Enuuk, yes, but not as a land to make our home. Instead, it shall be a bridge to the east, a wealthy staging-ground for us to uncover the past and fulfill the dreams of our goddess!"

We came to Nuzurbokh, but we were sorely disappointed; the soil was worthless, desolate. So we moved further, to what is now Zurkanek, and beyond, leaving the great expanse behind us untapped, untamed, unused.\n\nNo longer. Now we have tamed the steppe. Where once was barren steppe, now vast cultivated farms make use of the land, that stretch from one end of Nuzurbokh to the other. A hundred works, where but a quarter of it would feed our entire people.\n\nBut in expansion, comes extension. To remedy this, to ensure the bounty of the plains can be enjoyed by our people, each province shall have a guild, responsible for the final ordering of their land, and bound to a single, central authority. With this force, under their watchful eye, none but the best farmers will supply our homeland. With this, we shall never know hunger again! "

The Council watches with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and a few of the softer guildsmen flinch at the noise. When the sawdust and gunsmoke clears, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sees that every target is gone. He turns to the Gunsmith beside him. “And you said that your guild can make how many of these?”\n\n“Each of us can make one in a month, so I would put my estimates in the thousands.”\n\n“Ennuk’s grace…” [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] whispers. \n\n“That’s not all, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

When they fire, this time there is no trace of the targets. \n\nThe smith smiles proudly at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s shock. “Three months, that was the work of.

Built as a collaboration between the greatest Anarkhudi geomancers and the Architectural Sanadazjal, the Arakheösh was an elaborate combination of the two distinct building styles which now housed the forefront scholars of the realm.\n\nA large concave hill was constructed in a clearing within [Root.Capital.GetName], onto whose slopes were carved a collection of terraces and aqueducts. Each terrace housed a unique species of plant painstakingly collected by the greatest botanists of the realm, whose myriad colors resulted in the illusion of a square-patterned tapestry. A hexagonal core was carved out of the middle of the artificial hill, creating an open-air atrium. The interior of the hill was hollowed to house the top academic institutions of the country, which were in the process of moving their collections and operations to Arakheösh.\n\nThe collaboration was a success – especially when taking into account the similar building constructed in the largest city of the Anarkhudi. Already, the Architectural Sanadazjal and the builder’s guilds have announced the beginning of multiple joint projects with Anarkhudi organizations."

To those fools, one need only discuss the story of the Ironworker’s Sanadazjal.\n\nJust decades ago, the Ironworker’s Sanadazjal did not exist – after all, Yarikhoi is infamously lacking in the metal they are named for. It stands in harsh contrast to Nuzurbokh, which is overflowing with it. With our arrival to the mainland, a small group of esteemed metalworkers began to study the iron of the frontier and refine a technique for working it. With support and funding from the wider Sanadazjal, this group was able to engineer a highly effective method for the extraction and molding of iron, and off the back of this productive innovation, founded the Ironworker’s Sanadazjal.\n\nToday, this Sanadazjal is among the most powerful and is highly innovative in all the realms related to the dynamic metal. In no place can this better be seen than in one of its subdivisions, the Cannonmaker’s Sanadazjal. This capable organization is responsible for the proliferation of the cannon in our realm, and has worked tirelessly to integrate its techniques into our military, yielding stunning results."

They are clearly deluded, for any sane worshipper of Enuuk would be crying tears of happiness at the sight. The smog – Enuuk’s holy smoke! – is an indication of our rapidly rising industries and how far they have come. They are a sign that our industry is capable of rebuilding the land of the Rünsukhi, the civilization of our forefathers.\n\nThe heretics and heathens may blanch at the sight, but our cities and countryside, so full of manufactories and workshops, is beautiful in a way only we understand. We have become a land of industrialists, and as such, it is time we fully change our government to accommodate for the challenges ahead.\n\nOur state will be led by a council of those who are in charge of the coming transformation of Kashlaalg, the most influential industrialists and leaders of the Sanadazjal.

The workers inside no longer leave the buildings. All libraries, monuments – any unproductive plot of land – have been seized and co-opted by the Sanadazjal. All animals, pets, and plants within the city have been slain or destroyed, and their valuable flesh sent to Kashlaalg to feed the growing populace there.\n\nBut this is not chaos. In truth, this scene has been carefully coordinated by the Sanadazjal. With the Escalation Protocol, they have been given absolute power to do as they wish for the purposes of restoring our ancient homeland. Every person capable of walking has been mobilized and given a task to complete. Bureaucrats and ministers are rounded and sent to factories, where they assemble shovels and pickaxes. Teachers and shopkeepers, no longer needed, are sent to the fields to assist farmers in growing crops and livestock. At every street corner there is a group of Sanadazjal agents handing out tasks and orders. Outside of the city, the Sanadazjal has begun the construction of massive warehouses, where the population will eventually be moved for the purpose of more efficient organization and coordination.\n\nOf course, the rest of the nation has been spared, as this is only the initial test of the Escalation Protocol. Many are already uncomfortable with the extreme lengths which the Sanadazjal are willing to go to rebuild Kashlaalg, but it is undoubtedly effective. For the Sanadzjal, It is finally time for the Escalation Protocol to become a national decree. Others are still burdened by their doubts.

Hüülüdii could barely stay quiet for the first hour, after all, this was $MONARCH$’s first visit to one of the New Cities. But eventually even he corresponded to the quiet of both $MONARCH$ and the empty skyscapes. $MONARCH$ looked ahead.\n\n“Ah, an end at last. Well, I’m comforted to know the Sanadazjal has some limit to their capacities…” The duo arrived at a circular platform. From here, $MONARCH$ had a panoramic view of the whole city. A still lake, unbothered by animals or people, caught his attention. \n\n“Was that lake already there, or did your people make it?” \n\n“There was nothing here before. Just an empty desert. We diverted water from one of our canals…” Hüülüdii paused. “You seem especially quiet. Is there something wrong? Have we not reached perfection? Please, assist us, point out the flaws in our creation!” $MONARCH$ took a deep breath and leaned against the enclosing wall, not minding the hundred meter drop below him.\n\n“What can I say? I am amazed at the… potency of this place, I can scarcely believe the hands of men constructed this. Here, I feel the air of an alien world. I have begun to wonder if we Khamgunai are even worthy of beholding the glory of Enuuk… I can barely comprehend those gargantuan towers as-is. The scale. Do we even have enough people to inhabit this place?”\n\n“Of course. All of this was precisely calculated by the mathematical Sanadazjal. If you wish for us for decrease–”\n\n“No, no, there is no need. You have done well.” $MONARCH$ looked up at the clear sky – but even looking as high as he could, the shimmering towers still grasped at the edge of their vision. They could see the whole city from here, yes… there was no other choice. “Dusk is soon approaching. You may leave, but I think I will lay down here for the night. There is much to contemplate.” Nodding his head, Hüülüdii quietly walked away.\n\nAnd so $MONARCH$ sat there for a long while."

It stretches one thousand meters vertically and horizontally, and in so doing, stretches the comprehensible itself. The quote is credited to an unknown leader of the ancient city-builders, but it does not adequately describe the Sanadazjal today. Industry was perfected, but Enuuk did not return – so the Sanadazjal are beginning to look beyond the physical. \n\nIn the inner sanctum of the grand temple, buried under a kilometer of artificial halls, is where the Sanadazjal have gathered their greatest scientists and engineers. They are there to study the most potent artifacts gathered from every continent of Halann, and they have already begun to produce astonishing results. \n\nToday, the scientists have been entranced by a particular experiment. They stand watching an enormous, misshapen portal on the Sanctum’s far wall, lifted from some forgotten Precursor ruin or other. A scientist gives an arcane command, and suddenly, a stone-hewed statue rises, a golem cast in Fangaulan style. The object stands, walks to a colossal core of inscribed Aniwan and damestear, hefts it effortlessly, as a watching Hill Troll scoffs, but gives a nod of respect.\n\nThe statue carries the boulder a ways, as the scientists watch with bated breath – then a breathless heave, and it hurls it with all its might, straight at the portal.\n\nJust like before – just like the previous three hundred and eighty five attempts to provoke a reaction – the portal flickers. The stone disappears. And yet, a difference – one of the scientists suddenly yells, excited, enraptured: “I see her, I see Enuuk! She is right there!”\n\nThe scientists rush to replicate the conditions, interrogating their colleague for everything he saw. But try as they might, another sighting was not forthcoming. After another few months, the portal was deemed a failure. And so the Sanadazjal moved on to their next experiment – and the search for Enuuk continued."

You and your fellow diplomats have arranged to meet with a powerful Rünsukhi chieftain to establish a more formal relationship. For hours, there has been no sign of life in your vicinity, no sound but the mulling of your compatriots, and the shifting sands of the desert. Perhaps the Rünsukhi have chosen to ignore Ikögshaantus. A shame, but not too bad. When settling a new land, the cooperation of the local population is helpful, but not required.\n\n“Are you ready?” Behind you, a man emerges from behind a dune. How long have the Rünsukhi been watching?\n\n“Well – I suppose,” Your comrade says, quickly regaining their composure, “we can begin discussion on the topic of formal dip–”\n\nBut the man cuts him off. “There is no need. I and my fellow chieftains have unanimously agreed to cooperate with your authorities. But I – we – just want to know one thing: how do you intend to do it? I mean, to restore the land of our ancestors? My people have been waiting for centuries for this. it would be regrettable, if we decieved them. If your nation is incapable.” Silence from your compatriots: they seem unable to formulate any kind of response. So you begin to speak.\n\n“You speak of Enuuk’s dream? The restoration of the Khamgunai’s ancient homeland?”\n\n“Khamgunai homeland? Do you forget who you are speaking to? We admire your nation’s determination to reclaim this land, but for thousands of years we have dreamed of the prosperity of ancient times – for we alone have had to live in the harsh reality of the present! So yes, I refer to the restoration of the homeland. Our homeland.”\n\nAn angry voice instantly responds from your side: “So what do you want from us? Stop this nonsense talk!”\n\n“I want to cooperate. How can you not see it? Our goal is the same. I want your governors to stop all the nonsense of attempting to control our people – you are only hurting yourself.

Your repeated desecration of shrines and temples is an act of destruction, not labour – do you intend to destroy our people and settle our land as your nation did with the centaurs?” The eyes of the Sanadazjal officials fill with anger at the sacrilege. If you do nothing, they will surely have this chieftain arrested and replaced with a loyal puppet.\n\nExasperated, the chieftain rises from his seat, and bids you follow him into a back hallway. Expecting some kind of confrontation, the Sanadazjal remain in the meeting hall. Instead, you and the chieftain emerge into a large pentagonal atrium filled with religious artifacts – no doubt the heart of the palace complex. At the midpoint of the atrium lies a large geometric shrine, depicting a scene with spirits, rising to the arched ceiling. Straddling the walls of the atrium are various models of Khudi monuments, some of which you recognize.\n\n“You see now.” The chieftain’s words shock you out of your observations. “Our peoples are not too dissimilar. We both recognize the value of good architecture!”\n\n“How does this relate to anything? Stop playing!” Whatever trick he is playing, you want him to stop.\n\n“What I am trying to say is that the relation between our two nations does not need to be one so unequal – I assure you, if you allow your missionaries to destroy our faith, you too will lose something great in value! Our belief in the great spirit is what has allowed us to construct all these wonders.

We were forced to abscond back into the mountains, but the presence of such a strange people, and the capable weapons and magic they used, all but confirmed our suspicions of this land’s arcane capabilities. With this in mind, we continued further north, straddling the mountain range, until the forest of the demons ended and we were met with a vast desert, much like the one in Nuzurbokh. It was here where, lacking in supplies, we chose to descend. \n\nWe were able to meet with some local Rünsukhi, whom we had not known lived so far south. Their settlement being too small to house us for long, they advised us to accompany the trade caravan which passed through their town every few weeks. With little to do other than wait, our men were able to learn much about the lands to the south from the townsfolk. We learned of the kingdoms of the red Hobgoblin people, who are deeply in tune with magic but also highly xenophobic towards outsiders who have nothing to give them. However, we believed that the Hobgoblins would not attack us if we asserted our close association with the state of Ikögshaantus. \n\nTherefore, we accompanied the caravan to a southern city known as Iona Saothar.

Most of my team found little of interest in these, but one young engineer, named Kalaas Naanjorek, began to tinker with these cubes in his free time.

 ikogshaantus_events.29.b: "It’s not worth it."
 
 ikogshaantus_events.30.t: "An Unfamiliar Familiarity"
 ikogshaantus_events.30.d: "The Soulseeker Ogres are a curious bunch. Despite their appearance, their behavior is a far cry from that of the ravenous ogres to the west. Instead, through extreme determination, they have reshaped their natural instincts into something far more pragmatic. \n\nThey are a highly utilitarian race, reusing and investigating any artifact or structure of old they stumble upon, and having no taboos in regard to the technology they use for their esoteric goals. The Soulseekers worship an extinct race of elders, which they claim were once created towering cities which stretched to the stars. \n\nWe may find their emaciated appearance and ascetic habits alien, but it is hard to deny that their culture has many echoes of our own. Their belief in an extinct race of creators, to their hard-working pragmatism… among these misshapen people, we encounter an unfamiliar familiarity. The contradiction itself is intriguing. Perhaps it would be worth integrating them into our realm?"
 ikogshaantus_events.30.a: "Enuuk has clearly blessed them."
 ikogshaantus_events.30.b: "It’s not worth it."
 
 ikogshaantus_events.31.t: "Integration Finished"
 ikogshaantus_events.31.d: "The integration of one of the monstrous races of Nomsyulhan, once seen as monstrous, has finished. Already, the Sanadazjal are starting to establish contacts and establish new guild branches within the lands they reside in. Our administration no longer needs to quell constant revolts from them."
 ikogshaantus_events.31.a: "Good"
 
 ikogshaantus_events.100.t: "The Consecration"
 ikogshaantus_events.100.desc: "Thousands of Sanadazjal members descend onto the province, ready to examine and refine the artisans of the land. The task of the Sanadazjal is massive: they will go to every workshop, every manufactory, to ensure that production is up to the standard of Enuuk. Yet they are a capable organization, and they have an elaborate but effective system of coordination and logistics. A goal which would take decades for a lesser organization will only take a couple of years for the Sanadazjal."

 ikogshaantus_events.101.t: "Consecration Complete"
 ikogshaantus_events.101.d: "After years of hard work, the agents of the Sanadazjal all congregate once again to review their accomplishment: thousands of workshops and manufactories examined, tens of thousands of workers tested, thousands more machines and tools replaced. Nothing about the region may look different on the surface, but it is far more productive now. Yet there is no celebration among the Sanadazjal, only a steadfast determination to exercise the will of Enuuk."
 ikogshaantus_events.101.a: "We inch closer to perfection."
