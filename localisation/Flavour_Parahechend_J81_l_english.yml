 J81_1_1_leverage_the_scavvers_desc: "Make connections. Get your hands a little dirty. Raise some funds.\n\n“You know who I hate? SCAVENGERS. Like wild dogs, picking over the scraps of REAL elves, more glorious than they’ll ever be! I’ll be dead and buried before I see a Rakulacan picking scrap! But the outsider guilds, come to slum in the wastes of Parahechend from their homes in Nanru Nakar…? They aren’t Rakulacan – and even rabid dogs have their uses. Keep them happy, children, throw them a bone – scratch their back, and maybe they’ll help scratch yours!” – Denariatam Rakulacan, 1014, before negotiating a deal behind the Mudaliars’ backs"

 J81_1_2_an_offer_irrefusable_desc: "Make good on your debts. Reorganise your finances. Make enemies into outsiders.\n\n“Royakottar… oh yes, I’ve been there before. Jagged scrap walls cradling a crated core, like one of the old gods punched a hole right through the ground! Enjoy a girl and a drink at the House of Vice, buy a scrap-shield from the Kattyva Compound… but mind those Families that run them. Always with their eyes on each other – hah, a knack for cunning rare outside our family! But they all have skills you can use... and they’re keen to keep their competitors from getting a leg up on selling them. Make one of them an offer they can’t refuse, and the rest will come running like dogs desperate for dinner scraps!” – Harandar Rakulacan, 1315, before negotiating an alliance with the Kattyva"
 J81_1_4_a_lesson_in_economics_title: "A Lesson in Economics"
 J81_1_4_a_lesson_in_economics_desc: "Play around with numbers. Take a trip to Nagar Vyechei. Pretend you understand compound interest.\n\n“Yes, the profits will be considerable. It was a classic economic venture, that is the design, uncle. Yes, I understand how it looks– I assure you, the reputation of the Rakulacans has not been– yes, my operations in Orenkoraim are set up for that express purpose. Will they– will they cross us again? Uncle, I rammed a dagger into his brother’s eye. I had his child beaten to death in front of him. I think that’s more than enough to assure repayment! No– no– yes– um, yes–? Wait, I’m sorry– I don’t understand– do you actually not know what a loan is, or are you making a jape?” – Thelriatam Rakulacan, 1663, shortly before teaching his Patriarch what a loan is"
 J81_1_5_avarice_immortal_title: "Avarice Immortal"
 J81_1_5_avarice_immortal_desc: "Make new friends. Make more money. Make the biggest deal of your immortal life.\n\n“Of all the interlopers, I do really admire the Cannorians the most. No pretensions of moral superiority or a civilising mission, no grand plans to remake Taychend in their image. Just greed. And a pure sort of greed too– the sort of barely concealed avarice that makes a partner predictable. Oh yes… the perfect mark for a con. And their traders have a hunger for precursor relics so great, our thirst for wine looks comparable to… shall we say, the poultry’s desire for slaughter? We have to keep a realistic perspective, of course – they aren’t our friends, they’re our ‘business partners’. If they stop being so partnerable? Well… we already have all the cunning tricks we need– and with their money, we’ll buy the maul!” – Thelriatam Rakulacan, 1749, after negotiating a deal with the Kingdom of Busilar"
 
 J81_2_2_keeping_it_in_the_family_title: "Keeping it in the Family"
 J81_2_2_keeping_it_in_the_family_desc: "Expand the Rakulacan’s holdings. Consolidate your power as Patriarch. Keep it in the family.\n\n“There’s only one thing worth a damn in this world – blood. Thicker than water, more vital than grain. Flesh carries steel – blood keeps it loyal! And gods, do we have blood by the bucket full… a Rakulacan in every major city, from Clemetar to Vuls Tenvach. We lost our home, we lost our pride… but we will NEVER lose our family! That’s right, boy. It’s all about FAMILY. Working together, Rakulacan standing alongside Rakulacan! That’s how we’ll reclaim whats rightfully ours– that is how we will CONQUER THE WORLD!” – Kulacamothi Rakulacan, 751, whilst plotting the Rakulacan’s return to the Kalavend"
 J81_2_3_the_hammer_of_anathazhilan_title: "The Hammer of Anathazhilan"
 J81_2_3_the_hammer_of_anathazhilan_desc: "Delve into the Ruins for an artefact of ancient power. Reclaim the weapon of the Tyrant King. Ensure you are worthy of his legacy.\n\n“IMPUDENT WHELP! You throw away MY gold, you debase and diminish MY name, delving into damp ruins with your dissolute friends, and you DARE to come to me now with that hunk of metal in your hands?! Your only offering, the only scrap of usefulness you can summon up… a hammer! An oversized hammer! That’s all you dragged up from the infamous, impenetrable ruins of Anathazhilan?! Look at me, boy! At the resplendent silver-steel that adorns my body! This is glory– this is respect for the past! What is your hammer, against my Ruin-plate?” – Karanarma Rakulacan, 366, shortly before his untimely demise at the hands of his son, Varelrudu"
 J81_2_4_for_old_times_sake_title: "For Old Time's Sake"
 J81_2_4_for_old_times_sake_desc: "Conquer Yodhanchend. Smash some peasants. Get ready for another round.\n\n“Well, it looks like the peasant WRETCHES have risen up again! But we’ve been here before! Our honoured ancestor, Varelrudu, the Tyrant-King, has been here before! And he taught us that an unwashed farmer’s cotton chestplate does NOTHING against the MIGHT of Rakulacan steel! There’s a reason they call us down whenever their pitchfork-wielding warlords get uppity– and I have NO intention of throwing that reputation away today! So surge forwards in your assault, carry the fight to the enemy, scream your defiance in his face, STAB him, KICK him, BITE him, CUT OUT HIS LIVER– AND RAAAAAAAARGH–!” – Ultazhil Rakulacan, 1771, three months after last feeding on blood"
 
 J81_3_1_cunning_trick_crushing_maul_title: "Cunning Trick, Crushing Maul"
 J81_3_1_cunning_trick_crushing_maul_desc: "Reassure allies. Prepare a dastardly scheme. Get ready for a fight.\n\n“The Mudaliars… bah! Even the mention of their name makes me sick! Ungrateful, arrogant, selfish – and they think to lord over us! WE saved their empire from the peasants, WE saved their city from the Larankarha, WE saved their hides time and time again! And for what? They exile us, steal our home and hearth! And what have we ever done against them?! But they can’t get rid of us that easily, oh no… and now we’re nestled right in close at their darkest hour. All it takes is a cunning trick, and a swing of our crushing maul, and we’ll get back what’s RIGHTFULLY OURS–!” – Andrellatam Rakulacan, 1444, whilst scheming to betray the Mudaliars"
 J81_3_2_revenge_of_the_rakulacan_title: "Revenge of the Rakulacan!"
 J81_3_2_revenge_of_the_rakulacan_desc: "Make things right. Reclaim your home. Crush the Mudaliars.\n\n“Go, girl– take one long last look at the city you called home. The Citadel of the Tyrant King, towers tall, statues grand, slave-pens stocked and feasts aplenty! We gave them stability, we gave them order… my great-grandfather Varelrudu saved Nanru Nakar’s hides, and then my grandfather Geledish saved them from their so-called rightful kings! But who cares about the Nakari– who needs them?! Swear it on your blood, daughter-mine. Exile today– but one day, we’ll be back… and the Mudaliars will pay for what they’ve done to us! We’ll show them what it’s like to live in the shadow of another – what it’s like to feel the REVENGE of the Rakulacan!” – Kamnavna Rakulacan, 453, after the fall of Nanru Piristel"
 J81_3_4_enough_to_go_around_title: "Enough to Go Around"
 J81_3_4_enough_to_go_around_desc: "Get the family together. Divvy up Taychend. Put a Rakulacan on every throne there is.\n\n“Oh, sister– why the long face? Just because I’m getting married to a Sangamar doesn’t mean you can’t find a suitable match yourself! Go marry an old grey-beard, push him down a flight of stairs, take his city! There’s more than enough of those to go around– and the gods know that Taychend can’t get enough of our vast, Rakulacan… tracts of land. But to be truthful, I think I admire this Gelekar more than he admires me. An imperial scion, destined for greatness, a claim on the throne… and now a Rakulacan in his bed! It’s like they don’t even notice!” – Elazhila Rakulacan, 1249, five hours before her wedding to Gelekar Sangamar, seven hours before his assassination"
 J81_3_5_the_empire_of_blood_title: "The Empire of Blood"
 J81_3_5_the_empire_of_blood_desc: "Conquer Taychend. Surpass your ancestor. Found a new empire.\n\n“Where is my hammer? Ah– a fine weapon. When I was younger… the… boisterous exclamations. The rush of adrenaline. The joy of destruction– SWING AND SMASH! Ha… ha…. my own father, torn apart by its blow. Glorious… deserved. Hear me, boy– throw it out. Away… into the river. Yes, I am serious. They do not deserve it. Geledish will wave it around… but he doesn’t have the voice. Harashan the cunning, Dathna the might… all I’ve done…\n\nI thought I would be the one, did you know that? When I slew the Trickster-Goddess… I cried– TYRANNY–! A scream… and victory. I gloated, grinning wide– laughing, triumphant. I thought I had turned the Cycle with a single blow. Glory no longer, but order. I could have usurped the empire, claimed it, sought out glory… but I didn’t. They will, no doubt…\n\nBut what does it matter… it will be a long time yet… but someone will come along. Smart, cunning, powerful. And they will know what true tyranny is. To command without word… hold authority without title. Perhaps they will end this… sorry state of affairs.\n\nBut I will be looking on… and when… if… they join me in Dhivumanhu… I will tell them all about what it was like… to hold the WORLD at my fingertips! Not an emperor… not a warlord…”\n\n– the Tyrant King of Pirsitel, Varelrudu Rakulacan, 410. Last words"
 
 J81_4_3_rakulacimai_reborn_title: "Rakulacimai Reborn!"
 J81_4_3_rakulacimai_reborn_desc: "Destroy the upstarts. Reform the Old Kingdom. Rule tyrant-like over the Kalavend.\n\n“As your… husband? That’s the basis you plead on? You’d think me so soft of heart? Now I admit, I don’t have my father’s stature… his strength with the hammer, his… tyrant’s voice. That ability to inspire loyalty and dread-fear at the same time. But what I do have – and in great quantity, mind you! – is CUNNING! And you ought to RESPECT IT, because that cunning instinct is telling me one thing… the warlords are coming for YOUR head, NOT mine! So, you fire-haired harlot– I’m going to give them– what– they– want–! Argh– fine time to show a bit of spine–! Thought I could make it clean… soldiers, get the Empress’ body out of here–! And tell the others to purge as many of her bastard kin as we can while we’re at it! Hark, warriors– the age of the Mudaliars is over! Their empire buried with their blood! The day of the Rakulacan is here – and the ascendancy of Rakulacimai is nigh!” – Geledish Rakulacan, 415, at the murder of Elechana Mudaliar, and fall of the Mudaliar Empire"
 J81_4_4_return_to_the_steppe_title: "Return to the Steppe"
 J81_4_4_return_to_the_steppe_desc: "Subdue the Chendhya. Revive an old scheme. Dominate the borderland.\n\n“Gods… I hate Chendhyans. My great-great-grandfather hated them too! When Olhokar was around, he was the FIRST to join him on the steppe! Yes– No– Ok– the first KALAVENDHI. But that’s besides the point! We set up a fortress in the borderlands, ready to watch those jaguar-riding maniacs in case they ever tried to strike again! And we stood ready, we stood TALL! Until my great-great-grandfather went a touch… bankrupt. But trust me, Emperor! Give us Old Avucamvaida back, and this time, we’ll set up a watch that will last till the end of time!” – Jumondar Rakulacan, 1255, successfully negotiating with Emperor Dhalikar II Sangamar, seven years before the destruction of New Avucamvaida"
 
 J81_5_1_the_scythe_that_rattles_title: "The Scythe that Rattles"
 J81_5_1_the_scythe_that_rattles_desc: "Donate some horses. Buy some chariots. Harness the rattling scythe once more.\n\n“Hear that, boy? The rattling wheel, the whistling scythe. Don't see that much in Taychend anymore - the others abandoned the chariot... but we RESPECT the past! Metal death charging at you, severing your legs, running through your lines and coming back for more! The Rattalai – the scythed chariots of Parahechend – are hungry, just as we are - so remember to feed them!” – Harandar Rakulacan, 1317, before preparing to ally with Sarath Erradal against the Mudaliars"
 J81_5_2_dismember_the_upstart_title: "Dismember the Upstart"
 J81_5_2_dismember_the_upstart_desc: "Sow some seeds. Whip up some cons. Sharpen your hatchets.\n\n“Brother, the reason I wanted us to join him is precisely because of his weakness! Can you not see the divides? The Advakhalla still hate him, disquiet permeates the Endioka, the last Enlarmadar still lives in Marhed Rayodana– and Erankar does not have the fates on his side! A single defeat, a single loss, and his entire realm burst apart! Sure, he’s put it back together– but if we rise through his realm, sow discord, cause a few distractions? We can deliver a mortal blow from behind, and ensure he does not rise again! Please, Andrellatam– do you really believe Rakulacan might is such, that we can defeat a stubborn bastard like him muscle-to-muscle, elf-to-elf, in open battle?” – Thanand Rakulacan, 1445, while convincing his brother to ally with Larankar"
 J81_5_3_reinventing_the_wheel_title: "Reinventing the Wheel"
 J81_5_3_reinventing_the_wheel_desc: "Expand the chariot-industry to the Endioka. Teach the Larankarha what a wheel is. Go beat up the Kheionai.\n\n“Bah! Fine– there are MANY reasons these chariots have fallen out of use! They are finicky, difficult to use… and expensive. Gods, they’re expensive. Plate and mail jackets for the horses, fine-sharpened steel for the scythes, high-quality wood for the wheels and frame– But hear this, mercenary-king! Use them right, prepare the enemy, soften their hearts and their grip just a little bit, like tenderizing turkey–? They can CLEAVE through a packed formation. And may Valkadevu pity them if they run at first sight! You saw it at Macriavolo, didn’t you? My chariots, punching clean through the enemy flank! The Larankarha never favoured the chariot… but under Rakulacan guidance? We can help you reinvent the wheel– and HAMMER THE ENEMY TO DEATH WITH IT!” – Andrellatam Rakulacan shouting at Erankar the Defiant, 1460, amidst preparations for the Battle of Volisi Vara"
 J81_5_4_the_rattalai_race_title: "The Rattalai Race"
 J81_5_4_the_rattalai_race_desc: "Build more workshops. Make more Rattali. Win the Race.\n\n“Expensive? Oh, you’d better believe it. But its worth the price. You know, cos, I think you really need to get your head around the idea of ‘net profit’. Sure, I’ll lose six, seven good drivers, fine horses, four chariots… but so what?! Pull some strings, restock the teams, a donation here, an intimidated elf there, they’ll be back up to normal in no time! And the cost? The amount we’ll be making off of the bet, we’ll recoup it ten-fold. Two first-day rookies overtaking an entire score of veterans through sheer blind luck and the aid of the gods… a story for the age, and perfect cover. Besides, the veterans need more pay anyway! Quality is all good, cos… but when you’re rigging a Rattalai race, quantity can’t be beaten.” – Sithramothi Rakulacan, 1509, shortly before “winning big” at a Clemetar chariot race"
 J81_5_5_glory_rigging_title: "Glory Rigging"
 J81_5_5_glory_rigging_desc: "Strap a cannon on that chariot.\n\n“Papa! Papa! Look, I drew a picture! It’s a chariot, but the cutty-thing is on the front–! And then the frame is all metal and cool and stuff– and it has these things on the sides that shoot fireballs! Dangerous? Mmm– should be! It’ll turn all the bad guys into itty bitty bits!” – Rialavu Rakulacan at age 9, 1742, shortly after conceiving the first “plans” for her future invention: the Taychendi war rig"

 parahechend_events.1.desc: "Sun was setting over the palace at Parahechend, the dark descending on a dining room that overlooked one of the gardens. Usually a lively place, there were only two brothers here today. Andrellatam Rakulacan, the ancient family’s burly, big-bearded, bellow-voiced Patriarch, grimaced at the setting sun. He turned to his coyote-eyed brother, reclining on a divan near-by, raised a fist and thundered: “Brother, I have a CUNNING PLAN!”\n\nThanand Rakulacan sighed deep, and set down his wine glass. “Does it involve a lot of hammering?”\nAndrellatam laughed as he stepped back into the room. “Oh yes– but first, we’ll grease the maul! The Mudaliars – CURSE the name! – have always underestimated us, ever since they exiled us to this barren waste! But the middle brother taking you into his confidence was their fatal mistake! We’ll make them think we’re scheming to take over, bait them into an attack, and then CRUSH them with our Rakulacan might! Piristel retaken– RAKULACIMAI AVENGED!”\n\nAndrellatam’s brother rubbed at his temple. He’d taken a massive risk coming here, to a brother he was supposed to be at war with, and this was what he presented him? “Brother… that is the worst scheme I think you’ve ever come up with. Just let the Mudaliars fight their war, mop up after they’ve exhausted themselves! Or– better yet, sell out to Larankar! Make a deal, pick the winner as we always do!”\n\n“BAH!” Andrellatam stormed back to the garden overlook. “Varamraya has changed you– always with the delaying, the cowardice!” Andrellatam turned in time to see his brother roll his eyes. “Think of our ancestor, brother… think of Varelrudu, the Tyrant-King! Would he wait? DITHER?!”\nThanand gave a quick chuckle. “Well– I’d think he’d do whatever it takes to win.”\n“But what IS victory, if it isn’t at our own hands?! It was by Varelrudu’s own power that he CRUSHED the peasant-goddess Vehasha– caved in her chest with the Hammer of Anathazhilan, seized the reigns of an EMPIRE! Don’t you want that once more, brother? The elation, the glory?” Thanand fell silent, frowned as he picked up his wine-glass again."

 parahechend_events.3.t: "Betrayal of the Rakulacan" #Parahechend Ver.
 parahechend_events.3.desc: "The Mudaliar brothers were stone faced as they eyed each other. They were standing across a bridge that marked the border between their districts, the immensity of Nanru Nakar looming over them from all sides. Only a sliver of light slipped through the piercing-high, slum-cored, war-scarred buildings, an arrow cast through the gap in skyscraping stone carved by the river. Only an extraordinary threat could bring them together – and the news that their Rakulacan vassals were preparing to revolt was just that.\n\n“So”, Elatam, the older brother, spoke at last, “do you now realize your mistake?”\n\nErannan, the middle brother, scoffed, indignant. “With Larankar gathering in the north… the Rakulacan are perfidious, grudge-holding bastards– but how could I have known they would be so stupid?”\n\n“Yes…” Elatam said, sadly. “And yet, in our darkest hour, so they are. Our family’s luck has faded. But I will not let our name fade alongside it.”\n\nErannan sighed. He already knew what needed to be done. “This doesn’t concede my claim.” He stated, even as he offered his hand. “But we must strike quickly, and strike true. I doubt we can even call our allies.” Elatam made to shake his brother’s hand – but Erannan pulled away at the last second. “If we had Darandar… there would be no danger. And… maybe we could come to an agreement. After.”\n\nThe older brother’s face hardened, frown turning to a scowl. “No. You, I can fight alongside. Not him. Never him.” Erannan sighed in resignation, and put forwards his hand again."

Warriors, traders, merchants, householders, petty warlords, from all over Taychend. The statues of Patriarchs past watched over them. In the family’s past, when they were exiled from their home-city, destitute and dissolute, these gatherings kept them together… but they were somber affairs. Now, the room bristled with anxious excitement.\n\nEvindash tried to grab the room’s attention, failed– then thought to wait a bit more, til it die down on its own. But Karamothi cut in, bellowed for silence. Evindash smiled weakly, thanked him, stepped forwards. “So– Rakulacan! We, um– it’s time to fight! This will be a difficult one, so, um… its– we should go ahead and get our plots in order! Yeah!” Evindash chuckled nervously, as the rest of his family smiled at him, bemused. “So… who’s first?”[Root.para_event_4_vassal_text][Root.para_event_4_rayodana_text][Root.para_event_4_army_text]\n\nEvindash waited to see if anyone had any more schemes that they hadn’t told him about, but nothing was forthcoming, so eventually he just shrugged, smiled nervously. “Well, I guess, that’s it…?” They probably expected him to give a speech – but as he looked around, they already looked quite entertained.

You captured us, you buffoonish oaf–!” Darandar doubled over as his guard kicked him in the stomach. Erannan scoffed. “What a sick joke…”\n\n“A JOKE?” Karamothi gave a hearty laugh, as he at last stood before the trio. “I think NOT! This is SERIOUS business, Mudaliar! Remember Varelrudu saving your empire, Kulacamothi saving your hides from the Larankarha… and US, of course, fighting against Erankar?! Remember all we’ve done for you? We’re just getting our due recompense!”\n\nElatam looked up at his captor, indignant. “Do you really believe that? Varelrudu’s son destroyed the empire you say he saved! Murdered my ancestor! We gave you Parahechend, and you betray us– spit every chance we give you right back in our faces… and you say we are in debt to you?!”\n\n“Well,” Thanand added, as he smiled softly, “you’re still here, aren’t you? All that murdering and empire-destroying couldn’t have been so awful, could it?” “Yeah!” Evindash cut in, more enthusiastic. “And when we see an opportunity, we seize it! So– so take that!” Karamothi thundered a laugh once more, thumped his cousin on the arm, grinning. “And how RIGHT you are, my King! And you know what?” The Rakulacan war-master looked around him – at the splendor of the Mudaliars. “You can keep your city… or what’s left of it. Because I think I see a PERFECT opportunity to do to Nanru Nakar what you once did to Piristel!”"

 parahechend_events.6.desc: "The sound was deafening – all-consuming. The cacophonic neighing of the horses, the cries and shouts of the drives as they whipped them forward, the crash and jolt and rattle of the chariot frames, every bolt and screw and lashing leather smashed and thrown about in their places, struggling to keep the Rattalai together. Thirendesh had never taken part in a charge like this before.\n\nThirendesh looked to his partner on the frame for a moment – saw the mad terror in his eyes. He understood why. But for whatever reason, he just had a good feeling about this. Even as the bristling, impenetrable wall of Kheionai pikes drew closer, and closer. If they charged into that, they’d all die. Simple as that. Instant death – at least, he hoped it would be. But then an all-mighty TWANG from behind him, and the whoosh of stone and fire-pot. Thirendesh smiled as he saw the wave of projectiles fly over his head.\n\nThe driver looked back at the Ambhen before him – began to grin as he registered them look up themselves. Then he finally saw the terror on their faces, close enough to relish. He gave an inaudible prayer to the Dread-Charioteers of ages past, and readied himself. There was a crashing sound, and fire and blood and shattering-spears and smoke and bone and then–\n\nRattling. Screaming. Slicing. Maybe a few seconds of it. Thirendesh’s world was smoke and sound – but then he left it, and open field stretched before him. He had lived – the plan had worked. When he looked behind him, he saw first the bloodied remains of the charge – holes ripped through the Ambhen line, as severed limbs and chunks of gore littered the path of the Rattalai’s entry. Then he saw the Rakulacan cavalry, pouring through, following up on the one-two knock-out blow. He turned back, and whipped his horse to turn as best it could."

Their catapult-bombardment had broken the walls, scattered the defenders on the parapets. But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew there would be more inside. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] smiled as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stepped past the smoke, and a dozen elves – elite warriors all – rushed at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. The Patriarch hefted the Hammer of Anathazhilan in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands, and swung wide as the first guards approached. The whoosh of air– then the hammering of bone. Smash and crack and scream! [Root.Monarch.GetName] bellowed a might laugh as three elves fell to a single blow.\n\nBattle, blood, victory – at last, only a single elf stood before the Trickster’s statue, and the cowering high priestess at its base. He was clad in Precursor Steel – the captain of her guard. “HAHAHA!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] thundered. “A GLORIOUS TRY–!” The guard raised his sabre to strike. “–BUT NOT ENOUGH!” Swing, smash– then piercing, wailing, primordial scream, as the elf’s silver-steel breastplate burst apart. The shattering shards shredded the captain’s chest, blood and bone bursting from his back.\n\nThe Rakulacan warrior stepped aside as the captain’s body fell, lifeless. Then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] continued to the statue before him, shouldering the colossal hammer, a triumphant grin on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face. For a moment, the High Priestess looked as terrified as she had before – but she soon realised the futility of fear. She fell limply to the statue-base, despondent; she looked up weakly to her executioner. “You’re just playing around, aren’t you… this is theatre! An act– A jape!”\n\nThe Patriarch laughed heartily again. “Theatre? Sure! A jape–?! Not so, my dear farmer priestess! I’ve always thought the peasantry have let themselves down since the Tyrant-King last picked up this hammer of mine– caved in the chest of that upstart peasant doctor… DISGRACEFUL, really! So I thought I’d get them back into the fields, working till they bleed!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] took up [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestor’s hammer again, leveled it in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands. “But first… I figured I ought to pay a visit to the cult of his old enemy–”"

This cousin had dragged [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to a counting house in the depths of Nagar Vyechei, all for a spiel of numbers and blathering. “Bah!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] gave a hearty harrumph. “All this trick-terminology– what happened to a good old HAMMERING?! Explain it again– in SIMPLE Kalavendhi, or I’m gone!”\n\n“Well,” the bookkeeper began, “it’s a simple scam, really. We invent some nebulous investment opportunity in Ormam that needs a naval shipment of… say, expensive raw materials? That obviously needs capital– gold– to buy. So we go to those who have the cash. Promise big, lie big, get a bunch of important warlords to invest big– then stash their investments while we ‘spend’ the money ‘buying’ non-existent materials. Then, the non-existent boat carrying them all sets off– and ‘oh no! It’s been captured by pirates!’”\n\nThe cousin took over. “Everyone knows the Kheionai work through middlemen, and when you lose a ship off Devand its more or less gone forever. The goods are gone – but the money the investors spent on them isn’t. They’ll know something was wrong – but they won’t be able to do anything about it. No trail, perfect cover.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] crossed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arms, displeased. “But– we just took their money! Why not just– just SEIZE IT?!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stood suddenly, violently, slammed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fist on the coin-counter’s desk. “LIKE A TRUE RAKULACAN!”\n\nThe Rakulacan cousin jumped, fearful– but the bookkeeper simply smirked. “How can you seize what you don’t know about? You come around rattling the hammer, you won’t see a coin. They’ll hide it.” He turned to his trembling partner. “You told me about how the Mudaliars love to keep their gold in that undercity of theirs. You want to coax it out, you don’t need a blunt instrument–” he turned back to the Patriarch, looked [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the eyes. “You need an artist.”\n\n“The Mudaliars?” [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s disappointment evaporated at the mention – [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raised his eyebrow, curious. “Say… how many of these schemes of yours would affect them, exactly?” The bookkeeper shrugged, and lied big."

They were in the square at the city’s centre, standing before the torch-lit temple to Varelrudu Rakulacan, the Tyrant-King, their revered ancestor. Surrounded by the statues of Patriarchs past, of great Rakulacan heroes, gone to take their place in Dhivumanhu. Hundreds of them, perhaps a thousand or more – every member of the Family in Taychend, young old, foolish or valiant, boisterous and mighty or tricky and cunning – all looked up the steep-steps to their Patriarch and his priest-cousins, up at the sacrificial table.\n\nOxen-beasts had been driven up and laid to sacrifice; ninety-nine waiting to be slaughtered in the same fashion. A shard of precursor steel was bound to each of their necks, the hulk of living leather and flesh laid out on its side. The Patriarch lifted the Hammer of Anathazhilan high, then brought it down with smashing power upon the proverbial anvil around their neck. The soul-splitting scream of steel, the death-whine of the beast, the bowed heads and pressed-together hands of the supplicant Rakulacan – the Patriarch, bringing the Tuning Maul back, wiping its hammer with a cloth, nodding in due respect to the thing he has killed.\n\nThen anticipation – a hundred slain, and the Patriarch stepping forth atop the steps, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sacrifice made, his duty fulfilled. To the gods, to his family, to history. “RAKULACAN!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] called, and the masters of Taychend looked up in answer. “A thousand years ago, our ancestor ruled these lands! Commanded every corner of Taychend! Struck TERROR into the hearts of any who dared to stand against him! And a thousand years ago, it was STOLEN –“ The Patriarch held the Hammer aloft. “BUT WE HAVE RECLAIMED IT!” A raucous cheer, a cry of glory – [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned, to face his ancestor once more. “VARELRUDU, BEHOLD–” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] grinned bright and proud, and called to the heavens:"

They were standing across a bridge that marked the border between their districts, the immensity of Nanru Nakar looming over them from all sides. Only a sliver of light slipped through the piercing-high, slum-cored, war-scarred buildings, an arrow cast through the gap in skyscraping stone carved by the river. Only an extraordinary threat could bring them together – and the news that their Rakulacan vassals were preparing to revolt was just that.\n\n“So”, Elatam, the older brother, spoke at last, “do you now realize your mistake?”\n\nErannan, the middle brother, scoffed, indignant. “With Larankar gathering in the north… the Rakulacan are perfidious, grudge-holding bastards– but how could I have known they would be so stupid?”\n\n“Yes…” Elatam said, sadly. “And yet, in our darkest hour, so they are. Our family’s luck has faded. But I will not let our name fade alongside it.”\n\nErannan sighed. He already knew what needed to be done. “This doesn’t concede my claim.” He stated, even as he offered his hand. “But we must strike quickly, and strike true. I doubt we can even call our allies.” Elatam made to shake his brother’s hand – but Erannan pulled away at the last second. “If we had Darandar… there would be no danger. And… maybe we could come to an agreement. After.”\n\nThe older brother’s face hardened, frown turning to a scowl. “No. You, I can fight alongside. Not him. Never him.” Erannan sighed in resignation, and put forwards his hand again."

But he believed whoever had first rediscovered the ruins, and then delved far enough to apparently place the Varelrudu’s hammer there, had accounted for that. This was a trial… but set by who?

 parahechend_events.23.t: "Slip and Fall"
 parahechend_events.23.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] scurried up the side of the crucible, some of the skin ripping from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand as he climbed the steel. Larandesh had coursed his magic through the damestear-infused grooves on the stone – evoked a sticky substance that could hold your weight. It did the job – [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the last one up – then a chant, and the mage let the spell fail.\n\nThe party recovered their breath, and their nerves, atop the catwalks – the Challúmata below tried to climb themselves, but couldn’t make their way up. That didn’t stop them from trying, though.\n\nEventually, the Rakulacans began to stand, dust themselves off, collect their gear. They couldn’t stay here forever, watching the Challúmata claw at the crucibles, after all – and they still had to get their hammer."

 parahechend_events.24.t: "Charge of the Challúmata"
 parahechend_events.24.evindashdesc: "As the party delved deeper into the slaver-noble’s private mage chambers, they passed workshops filled with discarded magical implements and bone-white statues, unfinished and inactive. Clearly, the Slaver-Noble who owned this place was a crafter of Challúmata, mannequin-like necromantic golems, unceasingly doing their masters bidding even a millennium after their demise. No doubt, this place was full of them – they could only hope that Varelrudu had dealt with most of them – and they did pass through a few inactive, shattered Challúmata. \n\nUnfortunately, this was a false hope. Eventually, they came to a great chamber, filled with totally dull damestear crystals and the faint remains of discarded magic circles. Six tall, intricately grooved and engraved crucibles were lined up in the room, their tops connected by catwalks to an observation chamber. The personal foundry of Anathazhilan. They’d only taken a few steps in before they were set upon.\n\nMost of the Challúmata were cast in humanoid shape, men or women – most of elven type, but some were short and stocky, some had strange, short, rounded ears. Those ones were hollow, easy to smash in, send tumbling away or pin down – split limb from body, hack at their joints the same way you’d cut apart an elf of flesh and blood. But some of the golems were monstrous – one was like a walking lizard, mighty and tall.\n\nKaramothi fended it off, now– sabre batting the beast’s attacks away. Evindash was behind him, cowering – the Rakulacan was so done with him he could have used him as a shield. He knocked an arm off – sent the statue’s frame tumbling away with a kick. “We have to go–” But it simply picked its severed limb up, rammed it back in its socket, and kept on fighting. “NOW!”\n\nKaramothi made a mistake – missed a strike, breath catching as he braced for a blow from his enemy – but the party’s mage caught it first, sent a firebolt careening into the false lizardman’s maw. “I have an idea!” He cried, as he tapped his staff on Karamothi’s back quickly – then gestured to one of the crucibles."

 parahechend_events.25.t: "The Tuning Maul"
 parahechend_events.25.desc: "They found what they were looking for in what appeared to be some sort of bedroom. Perhaps where the old Slaver-Noble slept while he was deep in his studies or his fanciful machinations. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had always wondered about what it was like to be immortal – to spend thousands of years with unlimited resources. The things you could do… well, making a massive hammer wasn’t on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal list. But the thing was impressive regardless.\n\nThe Hammer of Anathazhilan rested on the Slaver-Noble’s desk, it’s head bigger than the Patriarch’s. A core of bone-white metal – the same Chenochallúm that the golems that had assailed them were made of – was encased in rippling Ruin-silver – even the shaft was made of Precursor steel. A letter had been laid atop the Tuning Maul’s head. “Only a Tyrant may wield this hammer.” It read. “May the screams of the righteous ring out once more.”\n\nThe Patriarch gingerly wrapped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands around the steel handle – for a moment, there was no Rakulacan boisterousness or bravado, just reverence. Then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt the surety of the grip – the throbbing vibration of the steel – and the power returned. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] hefted the maul, straining for a moment, before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] became accustomed to the weight. Then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned, leveled the maul – looked around the room for a moment, before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] settled on something – an engraved, circular sheet of Precursor steel – some type of plate. “Bring it to me!”\n\nOne of the sell-swords did – set it down before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] King when he ordered so. [Root.Monarch.GetName] took a breath – then heaved, swung and smashed. The plate practically burst as the Tuning Maul made contact – and it let out a terrible, piercing, primordial scream as it shattered so. Once the shock wore off, the Patriarch smiled, and raised the Hammer of Anathazhilan high."

 #New Vampire Event Chain
 parahechend_events.30.t: "An Offer from the Past"
 parahechend_events.30.desc: "Thelriatam Rakulacan was at a dead end. Fifteen years he’d been working for the Rakulacans, as their operative in Orenkoraim – he’d been in charge of making deals with Cannorian traders, selling the relics of old for gold and glory. Unfortunately, that glory never went to him. Skill, cunning, a complete denial of morality – it had gotten Thelriatam’s family everything… and Thelriatam nothing. The Rakulacan clasped his hands together, elbows on the table, exasperated – stared into the eyes of the women who sat in front of him. “I sell things.” He said, curtly. “I don’t buy them.”\n\n“Is that right?” Her perfectly calm demeanour almost made Thelriatam forget her dishevelled appearance, her blood red hair, her bone-white skin. The fangs at the corners of her mouth. The fact that she’d insisted on seeing him at night. “I heard you deal in relics… I have one.” She smiled. “I am one, actually. I could make you one too.”\n\nShe’s mad, Thelriatam thought. He returned her smile – decidedly more pitiful. “And how, pray tell, would you do that?”\n\nThe woman took out a gauntlet from her coat – the Rakulacan’s eyes widened as he saw what it was. The Bloody-Hand of Kadradar, the most powerful spell focus for blood magic known to elvenkind. “That’s…” Thelriatam shook his head, recollected himself. “A forgery. It has to be.”\n\nThe Cannorian woman smiled, as she put the gauntlet on, held her hand aloft so Thelriatam could see the damestear crystal pulse with mana. “Maybe. But you can see if it is, or not. You see… I’m…” Her smile broke, for a moment – a fleeting wave of somber remembrance – “I lost something of mine.” Then a flash of anger. “And I want it back.” The woman stood, held out her hand. “Close your eyes, and take my hand… and I will give you immortality. And in return… I want a family again. I want your family. I want you. Is that a good enough trade?”"
 parahechend_events.30.a: "“Oh, it’s more than enough…”"
 parahechend_events.30.b: "“Immortality belongs in the past…”"

 parahechend_events.31.t: "Two Princes"
 parahechend_events.31.desc: "The Cannorian woman – Mihaela – spoke matter-of-factly. “We’re Vampires – and I’m an Errant Prince. The first to be turned, the strongest. We all have our clans, sire-lines going down generations… you could turn some more, start one of your own if you want. It’s hierarchical like that, you see.” She stared forwards, eyes vacant. “They’re supposed to obey you. You need to make them, sometimes.”\n\nMihaela and Thelriatam had been relaxing amidst another training session – testing the limits of Thelriatam’s new, myriad powers, as they’d done for the past ten years. Then, all of a sudden, it was like a switch turned on. She told him everything so freely he hardly believed it. “And… there are more of you?” The Rakulacan thought back to that first meeting. “The people who took something from you– they were other vampires?”\n\nMihaela kept staring silently for a moment. “There’s a pack of us. They have their fancy little Blood Court now… just putting a name to their cabal of– of–” She shook her head, slightly, closed her eyes. Thelriatam had never seen her like this before. “They murdered him. And I let them.” He didn’t presume to ask who “him” was. Mihaela opened her eyes, turned to Thelriatam again – and the vacant sadness was replaced with regret, and spite, and rage. “I’ll never let that happen again. Let worry or fear stay my hand. Keep me from doing what I want! If they come for you… for us? I’ll make them suffer!”\n\nThelriatam could only bear her gaze for a moment. He turned, put a hand to his chin, mind suddenly racing. Not blood magic, but immortality by another means… the ability to create an entire clan of immortals… to truly usurp the power of the Slaver-Nobles! And Mihaela? This Blood Court had taken her family, no doubt… but he had one. The Rakulacans– and with her, he could get the respect she wants, the glory he desires– as Patriarch! POWER UNBRIDLED! Thelriatam began to laugh, a deep rumble that only grew to a thunderous crescendo. He turned quickly on his heel. “You want freedom? You want power? Just the two of us– we won’t be able to secure it. Not really.” Thelriatam threatened a smile. “Tell me… my sire. How would you like to be an Empress?”"
 parahechend_events.31.a: "Mihaela grinned. “I think I’d like that very much!”"
 parahechend_events.31.b: "Mihaela frowned. “Maybe ruling from the shadows is for the best…”"

 parahechend_events.32.t: "The Family of Blood"
 parahechend_events.32.desc: "The feasting hall was dead-silent. Hundreds of Rakulacans had been listening to their Patriarch give a speech. Then Thelriatam Rakulacan stood, smirking, slowly clapping. The Emperor halted, gobsmacked. “Such bluster…” Thelriatam had said. “But really… what is the point of all of you?” A round of gasps. The Patriarch opened his mouth to denounce the fool – but a hooded woman suddenly appeared next to Thelriatam, and waved her hand with a flash of power. The Patriarch began to choke on his words. “Rakulacan!” Thelriatam called. “We stand, the successors of the Slaver-Nobles of old. We have might, we have Taychend – but there is one power we have not attained… IMMORTALITY!”\n\nThe hooded woman climbed up on the table – and threw off her cloak. Surprise shook the hall – some were so shocked they rose from their seats involuntarily. A human, a Cannorian dressed in the light fabrics of Taychend – skin white as snow, and hair red as blood. And in her hand, a gauntlet that she held high, flexed for all to see. The Bloody Hand of Kadradar. The woman spoke in accented Kalavendhi, as the Patriarch fell dead to the floor. “I may not be from around here– but we share a common value! AMBITION!” Suddenly, a commotion– the Patriarch’s son drew his sabre and charged at the Cannorian. She kept talking anyway. “Raise me and Thelriatam to power!” The son rose to swing – “fight for me, die for me, AND–!” then a sudden turn – thunder-crack kick – shin-striking face – the son’s upper body bursting into red mist – and Mihaela’s voice cutting through, vainglorious: “– I WILL GIVE YOU THE WORLD!”\n\n“GLORY!” “TYRANNY!” “EMPRESS!” The vampires Thelriatam had already turned gave their instant, boisterous assent, cheering their acclamations. The rest either shrunk back in fear, or stood and joined the cry, eyes thirsting for the promise of power. Mihaela just cackled maniacally. When the cheers finally died out, Thelriatam’s sire, delight written across her face, turned to him – Mihaela no longer. He grinned at a scheme well executed, and introduced the Pale-Queen to her new family."
