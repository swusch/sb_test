 dartaxagerdim_the_green_helmets_title:0 "The Green Helmets"
 dartaxagerdim_the_green_helmets_desc:0 "Green has traditionally been seen as the colour of faithful purity in Bahar, so it was only natural for the followers of Ašuru Telissaku to wear a helmet wrapped in green cloth when sent on a mission, earning them the name Šebhuliam or Green Helmets. Originally only a radical splinter group of the Cult of Purity which rejected the conclusions of the Council of Brasan, the Šebhuliam have become a sect of their own in the decades following the Purge of Medurubar. The persecution of their fellow believers under orders of Taelarios have left them with a deep and abiding hatred of the sun elves, whom they consider treacherous servants of the Malevolent Dark intend on deceiving the Bulwari faithful.\nHidden deep within the Šad Kuz mountains, they have built their mountain fortress of Azka-szel-Parkellu, the ‘Fortress of the Seekers of Purity’, on the ruins of an abandoned harpy roost. From this hidden stronghold Ašuru and his inner circle recruited new followers attracted by their message of hatred, who were more than eager to carry out their assassination missions against sun elven officials in order to be initiated into the Šebhuliam.\nIt is no wonder, then, that the Green Helmets have become the first and most ardent supporters of Dartaxes’ rebellion aimed to overthrow sun elven rule over Birzartanšes."

 dartaxagerdim_reconquer_elusadul_title:0 "Reconquer Elusadul"
 dartaxagerdim_reconquer_elusadul_desc:0 "The ancient and venerable kingdom of Elusadul, oldest amongst the Gelkari kingdoms, has been another victim of sun elven misrule. During the Decades of Devastation, when petty ambition and overweening pride of the sun elven rulers of Bahar led to untold suffering amongst those they were claiming to guide and protect. By the time the goblins of Greysheep swarmed out of their mountain holes, the incessant conflicts of the past decades had left the former lands of Elusadul devastated and unable to protect itself, making them easy prey for the invaders.\nSurakel, in His mercy, saw to it that only a decade prior Dartaxes successfully threw off the elven yoke, and founded a new realm devoted to the protection of its people. Both within and beyond its borders. Thus Dartaxes could offer the Bulwari inhabitants of Elusadul fleeing the goblin horde overwhelming their homeland a new home safe from oppression.\nWith the refugees properly settled and the worst damages from the Decade of Devastation dealt with, some prominent members of the Elusaduli now living in our lands have lobbied the Akal to begin a war of restitution. A war of reconquest, to reclaim their homeland in the name of Surakel once more."

 dartaxagerdim_breaking_marble_title:0 "Breaking Marble"
 dartaxagerdim_breaking_marble_desc:0 "Ever since the Age of Three Kingdoms has Akal-Uak been the queen of the fertile Našra valley. But for most of the more than two millennia since then it has been overshadowed by its rival to the north, Aqatbar, the ‘Jewel of the North’ and self-proclaimed center of Bahar. Neither city state could ever truly claim control over all of eastern Bahar, but it did not stop them from trying.\nMighty Aqatbar has fallen, however, and been humbled by a horde of goblin savages, whose voracious appetite for loot combined with their benighted disregard for priceless monuments of the past has caused unimaginable chaos and destruction to this venerable city.\nThis cannot stand, and we must set aside past grievances and come to the aid of our brethren, who are languishing under the burden of foreign rulers that might even be more ill suited to reign over Bulwari than the Sun Elves, as hard to imagine as that might be. The goblins shall be chased back to their mountain homes, and if they resist, it shall be their thick heads instead of our marble edifices that will be broken from now on."

 restore_azka_szal_azka_title:0 "Restore Azka-szel-Azka"
 restore_azka_szal_azka_desc:0 "Azka-szel-Azka, Citadel of Citadels, was once considered the greatest fortress not only of Bahar, but of all of Bulwar. A man-made mountain guarding the fertile valley of the Azkapas, it once contained within its walls not only a fortification thought utterly impenetrable by many, but one of the greatest cities of Bahar.\nEver since the War of the Sorcerer King, when it was held by the lickspittle servants of Black Castanor only to be besieged and eventually conquered by the accursed Phoenix Empire, Azka-szel-Azka’s storied history has taken a downward turn. Over the last centuries the still imposing fortress has fallen into visible disrepair, its role as the heart of western Bahar replaced by Re-Uyel. But now, as the true lords of Bahar once more hold sway over this unique redoubt, it falls to us to restore this Citadel of Citadels to its former glory, so that none shall contest our control over western Bahar ever again."

 dartaxagerdim_wealth_of_bahar_title:0 "Wealth of Bahar"
 dartaxagerdim_wealth_of_bahar_desc:0 "The people of Bahar have always longed for the sea, ever since in far antiquity the cedars of our wooded homeland have become a treasured commodity sought after by shipwrights all across the Divenhal. Only the Ayabnati hailing from the many islands of the eastern Divenhal can lay claim to a longer history of maritime mercantile ventures.\nIt is thus only natural that we should encourage this ancestral proclivity amongst our subjects and send them out once more to trade with the many peoples of the western lands hungering for the riches of Bulwar. With the proper investments Aqatbar, Re-uyel and Deškumar are predestined to become the central mercantile hubs of our newly revitalized trade with Cannor."

 dartaxagerdim_tungr_copper_desc:0 "The bonds of friendship between the Copper Dwarves of Dur-Adhurud, or Ovdal Tûngr in their language, and the Bahari stretch back not just centuries but millennia. Ever since God-king Iraskar the Benevolent invited the Marble Dwarves of Shaztundhir to resettle the abandoned hold, our two peoples have maintained amicable relations, even in the face of conflicts forced upon them by foreign imperial powers such as during the Jaherian blockade.\nTheir claim to their mountain home is as old and strong as ours is to the gently rolling hills of Bahar surrounding it. By filling our ancient friendship with new life, we all stand to benefit. A hold prospering from the profits made by revitalised trade, and a realm benefiting from the ingenuity of dwarven inventions, in particular with regards to their battlefield applications."

 dartaxagerdim_mages_and_astronomers_desc:0 "The art of astronomy has always been held in high regard in Gišhuram, earning it the moniker ‘City of Astronomers’. The Great Planisphere housed beneath the blue dome of the House of Stars is but the most prominent result of the untold centuries of astronomical scholarship amassed by the Gišhurami.\nIt is of little wonder then, that this vast treasure trove of knowledge regarding the celestial sphere has caught the interest of many mages over the centuries, who in turn contributed to the insights stored in the private libraries and the House of Wisdom or ‘Azahazin’ of the city, with the elven mages of Varamhar only the last in a long line.\nLuckily for us, we have managed to take over these lands without relying overly on the Šebhuliam, thus ensuring that they did not have the opportunity to destroy priceless knowledge in their fervor against all things elven. Instead, we shall reap the benefits of the wisdom painstakingly gathered over the millennia."

 dartaxagerdim_mourning_the_past_title:0 "Mourning the Past"
 dartaxagerdim_mourning_the_past_desc:0 "The Cult of Purity that gave rise to the Šebhuliam is itself an offshoot of the Cult of Mourning, a branch of the Sar-Arukanaš born from the devastation the lands along the lower Suran suffered in the wake of the Red Xhaz over four centuries ago.\nThis suffering provided the deceitful elves with an opportunity to raise themselves up as the Chosen of Surakel, rightful protectors and masters of Bulwar. But now that we rule over these lands, we can finally ensure that all Bulwari victims of the machinations of the Malevolent Dark are granted the proper and equal remembrance they deserve, whether they have fallen under the Red Xhaz, during the sun elven kinstrife of the Cinder Wars or during the Purge of Medurubar, the tragic massacre of the faithful that birthed the Cult of Purity.\nLet us remember the fallen, and let their memory steel our resolve, so that no outsiders shall tread over the Garden of Surakel and butcher His children ever again."

 dartaxagerdim_revenge_upon_the_gnolls_desc:0 "After the time of mourning has passed, the time of retribution begins. For all the atrocities committed against our forefathers by the gnolls infesting the Šad Sur we shall be the avenging blade of judgement. Once, these mountains were home to the Šadnatu Akalate, the shield warding Surakel’s Garden against the vile gnoll raiders of the southern desert. It now falls to us to restore the proper order of things and return their homeland to their descendants, chasing the gnolls into the wilderness where they belong. May the Kasiyaru bloom again in the wild fields of Šadnatu."

 dartaxagerdim_prepare_storm_title:0 "Prepare for the Storm"
 dartaxagerdim_prepare_storm_desc:0 "The Light of Surakel burns brightly within the hearts and minds of the faithful. A light like this cannot be so easily extinguished as our many enemies may believe. Whether they be the goblins swarming through the hills and valleys to our north and west, the arrogant elves subjugating our people to the south and east or the many many minions of the Darkness slithering in the shadows, plotting our demise.\nBut we shall not go down without a fight, the fire of our faith and freedom shall not gutter out like a lone candle in a storm. Instead, the wildfire lit in our hearts shall burn our enemies and all they hold dear. With Surakel's Light to guide us, we will march to freedom and victory or to the liberation of His eternal embrace."

 dartaxagerdim_fall_of_imuluses_title:0 "Fall of Imulušes"
 dartaxagerdim_fall_of_imuluses_desc:0 "During one of the darkest periods of Bulwari history, when Surakels Garden was beset on all sides by the minions of Darkness, Jaher and his elves arrived. Amongst their number was Amarien, who chased away the Harpy raiders of Tounafira and shackled their queen. For her service in protecting his lands, the akal of Baharšes granted her and her descendants dominion over the province of Imulušes, and they have ruled these lands ever since. Out of Imulušes grew Birzartanšes, land of pencil-pushers and petty elven lords. Yet the Amarienzuir lost all claim to legitimacy when they bled the land and its people dry on the altar of their overweening ambition.\nIt is our destiny to finish what Dartaxes started more than two decades ago with his rebellion. The purple phoenix must bow before the rightful ruler of all of Bahar. All lands from the Harpy Hills to the Gulf of Glass shall be united once more under a righteous servant of Surakel."

 dartaxagerdim_akal_baharses_title:0 "An Akal of Baharšes"
 dartaxagerdim_akal_baharses_desc:0 "Dartaxes is not the first son of Bahar with the ambition to free his homeland from the grasp of foreign invaders. Nearly a thousand years ago Parxares the Great chased the descendants of gnollish matriarch Zheh the Scholar from their cushy thrones and continued to unite Bahar with his mighty sword arm and cunning silver tongue until his realm stretched from the Šad Kuz to the mountain abode of Ovdal Tûngr.\nWith his mighty deeds, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven worthy of this legacy and can lay claim to the mantle of Akal of all Baharšes. No more will Bahar be shattered into petty fiefdoms caught in a neverending internecine struggle, a mere plaything for would-be empires lurking on our borders, but a proud and strong kingdom for a proud and strong people. May all the many constituent parts of Bahar prosper under the benevolent guidance of [Root.Capital.GetName]."

 dartaxagerdim_wars_of_unification_title:0 "The Wars of Unification"
 dartaxagerdim_wars_of_unification_desc:0 "The unification of all of eastern Bahar under our rule is certainly cause for celebration, but it would be a fatal error to rest on our laurels. We may have reclaimed our home from invaders both recent and not. We may have succeeded in becoming the new hegemon of Bahar, a shining beacon of freedom for the faithful, a haven of prosperity surrounded by strife and devastation.\nBut our duty is not yet fulfilled, our task not yet done. Beyond our borders, the once prosperous plains of the Suran remain engulfed in chaos, torn between petty Sun Elven kingdoms which prefer to spill the blood of their subjects for their futile ambitions instead of warding the Garden of Surakel against the looming threats from beyond its borders.\nThe Šebhuliam already grow restless for lack of a foe to fight against, so we shall give them a new target for their hatred. The armies of Baharšes shall march once more and bring our southern brethren into the fold, as is the Will of Surakel."

 dartaxagerdim_destroy_irrliam_title:0 "Destroy Irrliam"
 dartaxagerdim_destroy_irrliam_desc:0 "Medurubar is the nest of the viper that has poisoned the minds and souls of pious Bulwari for centuries. Here, Taelarios Irrliamzuir has wrought his heresies and corrupted the true teachings of the Sar-Arukanaš for his own purposes and those of his elven kin.\nAnd it was here, in the heart of Irrliam, where his accursed henchmen of the Order of the Zenith massacred the devout faithful of the Cult of Mourning during the Purge of Medurubar. Only by the grace of Surakel could wise Xakkim flee with his most pious disciples and bring the creed that would become the Cult of Purity to our lands. If not for him and his son Ašuru Telissaku, who in turn founded the Šebhuliam, the ways of our faith might have been lost forever.\nIt is only natural then, that now that we hold the former lands of Irrliam, our fervent Šebhuliam are most eager to cleanse the land of any trace of Taelarios and his ilk. The burning fire of their devotion is not something we can hold back in this instance, but we may be able to influence how far their flames spread."

Like the two chambers of a beating heart, the lifeblood of Bulwar runs between these most august metropoles.\nThey truly are the crown jewels of Surakeš and it is our hallowed duty to take both under our steadfast protection, so that no harm may befall them ever again. Under our stewardship, they shall reclaim their former glory and become marvels beyond compare once more, spreading the fame of Bulwari civilization far beyond our borders."

 dartaxagerdim_a_rising_dawn_desc:0 "If there is one certainty uniting all followers of the Devotion to the Light, the Sar-Arukanaš, it is that even after the longest night, a glorious dawn will flood the land with His Light and chase away the Dark.\nOur night has now passed, and our dawn is at hand once more. Surakel’s Garden, the Kirimahsur, has once again found a worthy caretaker. It is now time to sheathe the sword and pick up the plough to free it from the weeds that have sprung up in the many centuries since the Garden last was properly looked after.\nWe shall reconsecrate the Kirimahsur and purify the lands of Surakeš until all traces of the corruption left by the machinations of the Malevolent Dark have been removed."

 dartaxagerdim_companions_of_dartax_title:0 "Companions of Dartaxes"
 dartaxagerdim_companions_of_dartax_desc:0 "Our glorious Akal Dartaxes was not simply born to rule, he took up the mantle of responsibility and chose to lead our people. After a stellar rise through the ranks he was granted command of the northern armies of Birzartanšes and shattered the Baharkandi forces at the battle of Habqez. During the early stages of the Great Rebellion he and his loyal forces became the de facto rulers of northern Birzartanšes, while ineffectual Arantir languished on his cushioned throne in Birzartansbar, his only contribution to the war effort intermittent useless orders.\nAfter half a decade of this moronic interference, the last vestiges of Dartaxes’ loyalty were torn apart by an ultimatum to return to the capital and face punishment for his loyal service. The fateful meeting between Dartaxes and Harum szal-Harumanz, leader of the Šebhuliam, convinced him to follow another path instead and take up the banner of Surakel. Thus began the great task of freeing the Bahari from foreign oppressors.\nBut an Akalate can only ever be as strong as the dynasty at its helm, and without an heir, one well-aimed arrow might mean the end of our most noble endeavour. Now that the borders are secure, Dartaxes must now put his mind to dynastic matters and find a suitable spouse from amongst the noble families of his loyal companions."

 dartaxagerdim_humble_the_bastard_title:0 "Humble the Bastard"
 dartaxagerdim_humble_the_bastard_desc:0 "The rump state of Azka-Evran is all that remains of once prideful Baharkand that thought to challenge Birzartanšes for hegemony of Bahar. But instead of becoming overlord of all Bahari, they merely opened the path to the Marblehead Goblins when they descended from their mountain homes to claim ancient Aqatbar for themselves.\nThe last akal of Baharkand, ignominiously slain by a goblin blade, left behind no surviving legitimate heir, only Deggarion the Bastard, who who led the last loyal retainers of his father on a desperate flight to the mountain fortress of Azka-Evran. He has since stewed in this remote stronghold, wasting the meagre riches of his petty fiefdom.\nPlotting ever more grandiose plans to reverse the tides of time and restore sun elven rule over Baharkand, his delusional proclamations may be a precious source of mirth amongst the court of Dartaxâgerdim, but we should not forget the people suffering under his mercurial whims. Let us humble the Bastard and put an end to his pathetic ambitions, once and for all. He is clearly as ill-suited to rule as his father was, and we shall relieve him of the burden of such ambition as well as his swollen head."

Untold riches just wait to be extracted and used to fund our sacred mission. All it takes to fill our treasury with the bounty of the earth is a concerted effort to restore and expand the mining operations that were disrupted by the chaos of the Decades of Devastation."

 dartaxagerdim_wishcrafters_of_bahar_desc:0 "While the art of Wishcrafting is but a pale shadow of its former glory during the reign of the Šedu, it is still one of the mainstays of Bulwari magic. By permanently investing magic into an item even non-magicians are capable of using magic in a limited fashion for their benefit. By supporting the Wishcrafters or Kurešimi in their endeavours, we are sure to reap many benefits from their ingenuity."

 dartaxagerdim_free_the_sheepmen_title:0 "Free the Sheepmen"
 dartaxagerdim_free_the_sheepmen_desc:0 "The ram is a fitting heraldic animal for the Gelkari people, for not only are their sheep herds of vital importance for their way of life and very survival during the cold winters in the mountain vales, but like rams, they do like nothing more than butting heads. They are fiercely clannish and would never freely allow one of their city states to rise above and rule over the others.\nHowever, as the harpies have shown time and again, the Gelkari are more amenable to shared submission under outside rule. Therefore, or so our vassal the king of Elusadul argues, it is only reasonable that we should ensure that the lands of Gelkar shall be gathered beneath our benevolent rule. That this would make him the first amongst equals of our Gelkari vassals surely has no bearing on his insistence on this course of action."

 dartaxagerdim_the_harpies_fettered_desc:0 "Ever since the harpies first descended from their mountain roosts we Bahari have been forced to either fend off their constant raids or submit to their demands for tribute. The hidden heart of the Šebhuliam itself, Aska-szel-Parkellu, has been erected on the ruins of Tounafira, the former capital of the harpies of the Šad Kuz.\nThey may have been part of Surakel’s Garden for far longer than the elves, but they, like the gnolls, have for the most part refused to accept the truth of Surakel. We are the foremost defender of the faithful, so it is only proper that we shall end this threat once and for all and fetter the harpies.Those matriarchs who are wise enough to bend before the throne of Dartaxes shall be allowed to serve as our vassals, but we shall clip the wings of any matriarch who dares to defy Surakel’s Order."

 dartaxagerdim_the_sacking_of_sareyand_title:0 "The Sacking of Sareyand"
 dartaxagerdim_the_sacking_of_sareyand_desc:0 "Sareyand, as the elves have named the city rebuilt on the bones of ancient Raxaklu, has been a stronghold of the Sun Elves ever since the time of Jaher. One of the most powerful successor states of the Phoenix Empire, the Akalate of Sareyand has assumed the role of hegemon of the upper Suran, a fulcrum of elven rule over Bulwar.\nWhile even the Šebhuliam reluctantly agree that the elves ruling from Sareyand are a lesser evil than the demonic gnoll horde gathered under Zokka, and have provided all of Bulwar with a valuable service by holding out steadfastly against the incursions of these demonic servants of the Malevolent Dark, this only serves to mitigate the crimes committed by the Sarelzuir and their lackeys against the faithful, yet it does not entitle them to clemency. The Šebhuliam are particularly incensed by the suggestion that there is something to be learned from the Sun Elves and our armies might do well to study the famed Ash Legion of Sareyand, applying their training methods to improve the discipline of our warriors. In their eyes only a purification by fire may redeem the sins of this city and turn it into a place worthy of being inhabited by the faithful."

 dartaxagerdim_curb_sebhuliam_title:0 "Curb the Šebhuliam"
 dartaxagerdim_curb_sebhuliam_desc:0 "The Šebhuliam have over time gained an excessive amount of influence in our Akalate. Always at the forefront of our armies, they have become the very image of pious warriors devoted to the Light in the minds of the common people, and their veterans have gained influential positions not only within but also outside of our military, some even rising to serve as trusted ministers and confidants to the Akal themselves.\nHowever, this rapid ascent has only fuelled their rivalry with the traditional nobility of the Barkabti. While the nobility have proven their loyalty to us, faithfully administering our newly won lands and serving as the voice of the Akal in far-flung provinces, the Šebhuliam's fanatical ambitions may one day tempt them to challenge the authority of the Akal himself. This is something that cannot ever be allowed to happen for the sake of the realm. Reining them in and removing them from their entrenched seats of power will certainly be a difficult and costly task, yet the alternative would be even worse. One does not allow a gangrenous limb to fester, it needs to be cut off swiftly and decisively so that the whole may live, no matter the pain and suffering involved in the process."

 dartaxagerdim_kizar_of_the_szal_fazil_desc:0 "Magušim, the art of magic practiced in Bulwar has an ancient and venerable history stretching back millennia, but presently it is in a quite precarious state. Due to the Jexisian Ban prohibiting the use of magic by human Bulwari in all Sun Elven realms for the last centuries, many esteemed magical traditions have either been coopted by elven mages or forced underground and on the verge of vanishing into obscurity. While the ban is not universally enforced to its full extent, only in the remote corners of Bulwar, far from the seats of power of the elven Akalates have some traditions managed to not only endure but thrive.\nOne of these are the magi of the szal-Fazil, a remote tribe of the Mašnsih wandering through the Far Salahad. And now, one of their number has reached the court at Akal-Uak with an intriguing proposal. Kisar szal-Fazil, daughter of the tribe’s head and a powerful mage, has offered to devote her service to our cause in exchange for our promise to turn Dartaxâgerdim into a safe haven for human magi and allow them to replenish their ranks with new students, in order to return the art of Magušim to its proper place of prominence in Baharšes."

There is already fervent speculation among scholars of djinn lore that it might well be the ruins of Is-Kuršag, one of the four main centers of the Šedu, where the djinn experimented with the effects of the Wish on our material plane.

As exorcist-priests they, unlike their brethren in the other Ereš, operate under the jurisdiction of the temples and practice their art solely for the glory of Surakel and to the benefit of His people.

Not just priceless historical artifacts from the dawn of Bulwari history, but wishcrafted marvels from the age of the Radiant Sultanates that still retain their genie-wrought wish magic.\nThe arcane scholars gathered at our new-founded academy have studied these discoveries extensively and have come to the conclusion that continued research on the operating principles behind their continued magical power even after being buried for several centuries will be essential for advancing our magical knowledge.\nThis will have to be done carefully and methodically, of course, given the propensity of reality-warping wish magic to cause catastrophically unpredictable results if being overtaxed, but the first practical results appear truly promising. Our Kurešimi have managed to mesh the inscriptions enabling our flying carpets with knowledge gleaned from these artefacts to craft massive flying battle platforms that will become the core of our Zamukaraš, our Army of Heaven."

To satisfy their insistent demands many at court suggest to secure a secure supply of it for ourselves, or at least find a reliable ally or subject willing to supply us with Damestear. Others point out that we might do well to secure the favor of the master Kurešimi residing in Kurešim-kišbar, the city of Wishcrafters nestled in the bosom of sacred Mount Lazzaward, who might provide us with access to Anniwan, an alloy of Damestear, tin and powdered lapis lazuli, which would greatly reduce our need for raw Damestear while retaining its magical potency."

Over the last centuries, they have faced persecution elsewhere at the hands of the Sun Elves and their minions within the so-called ‘New’ Sun Cult.\nAside from the Cult of Purity that originated in the lower Suran plains, and its firebrand offspring, the Šebhuliam, there are many other cults found within our lands. One of the most prominent ones is the Gelkari Cult of the Wise Master, which reveres one of the four Erbatraši, Lahmaš of the Lamassu, as chosen messenger of Surakel. Another cult with deep roots in these lands is the Way of the Moon, who believes that the Malevolent Dark did not slay Kuza, revered mother of Surakel, but merely forced her into a deep slumber from which she will awaken once Surakel finally triumphs over the Malevolent Dark.\nWhile we share a common history of maltreatment at the hands of Taelarios and his ilk with these and many other shunned cults, it is not enough to share a common enemy. To truly prosper and strengthen our shared faith, we must find a common ground, so that the former harmonious coexistence between the many cults, lost under the Sun Elven reign, may be restored."

It will take time and effort to draw out this poison and remove this taint from our sacred faith. One of the greatest failings of the Council was the conceit that it was desirable or even possible to unify the many disparate cults under one singular doctrine.\nOne truth we who have rejected the Council have always recognized is that there are many roads you may walk towards the Light of Surakel, all equally valid. Our faith is like the light of the sun itself - stemming from a single source, but with a myriad of rays that shine their light even into the darkest corners.\nThe fact of the matter is, without the many regional cults sheltering His Light during times of adversity the Sun Cult itself may have been extinguished in the two and a half millennia of its existence. By embracing this diversity that is our birthright as Bulwari, we will strengthen our faith as a whole."

Whether by a scorching fireball, a searing column of fire, or, in case of overwhelming enemy numbers, a final glorious conflagration consuming both the scorch priest and all enemies in their vicinity, their talents have already proven invaluable in several pitched battles.\nIt is long overdue to formally acknowledge their exalted role within our armies and let them deliver the wrath of Surakel upon our enemies.

But this ancient art has suffered increasingly over the last centuries of rule by the Sun Elven usurpers, and many of the remaining practitioners have been lost during the many conflicts in the Decades of Devastation in Bahar. It is our most solemn duty to revive this ancient art.\nHowever, for the time being we can only spare the resources to restore one of the four main Ereš, or knowings, of the Magušim to its former glory. Is it the Ereš-sašur, the art of forcing order onto nature and the elements, that our war-torn lands need the most? Or should we follow the example of Brasan and support the Ereš-dirkešir, the art of binding other beings from this plane or others to the will of the mage? Ereš-malthar, the art of inscription, on the other hand might allow us to create powerful magical items and artifacts. And let us not forget that the Ereš-sar, the knowing of Light, is the magical art most favored by Surakel. Which Ereš should benefit from our efforts?"

It is therefore of the utmost importance that our Akal chooses a proper Akali to beget a trueborn heir to the throne.\nWhile he is not completely bereft of blood relations, his nephew is not his son, and the fractious alliance that turned a rebellion into an akalate might quickly shatter if there is even the slightest question regarding the legitimacy of an heir.\nTherefore, to secure his legacy and ensure that his mission will not die with him, Dartaxes needs to choose a bride, and he needs to choose now."

The spearhead ended up with the line of Eletar, and in due course came into the possession of Deggarion the Bastard.\nAs they say, to the victor go the spoils, so with Deggarion’s body and his army laying broken at our feet, it is now upon us to decide what to do with this broken symbol of sun elven might.\nEven in its current diminished state, it is still a marvelous weapon, glittering with an inner light, its metal inlaid with glyphs of old and powerful magic.

While his blood runs in her veins, she has demonstrated at least a passing interest in the wellbeing of her subjects and an aptitude for governance. Nonetheless, her efforts were too little, too late, and with our forces in control of her realm, we are now faced with the choice what to do with the former queen of Birzartanšes. Should she be punished for the sins of her father, or have her efforts to undo her fathers miserable legacy redeemed her enough so that her life may be spared, as long as she is confined to one of the elven monasteries for the remainder of her existence? Others, the Šebhuliam first amongst them, clamor for her blood and that of her court.

 dartaxagerdim_events.5.d:0 "For the people of Bahar there are not many reasons to mourn the removal of their former sun elven overlords from their thrones. Their legacy in our homeland has been quite ambiguous, to say the least.\nYet one innovation they introduced to Bahar has received the grudging admiration of quite a few at court. The Jexisian examination system, reintroduced and improved upon by Keladora Birzartanzuir has led to a noticeable streamlining of bureaucracy, keeping corrupt individuals from positions of power, and overall greasing the wheels of governance.\nWith $COUNTRY$ now in control of the former heart of Birzartanšesi administration, a decision has to be reached on how to deal with this legacy. Should this smoothly operating apparatus of state simply be employed for a new, better purpose - our continued ascent -, with only the highest ranks staffed exclusively by loyal and competent Bulwari aristocrats? Or do we risk tainting all our future successes by relying on this creation of elven statecraft and should instead return to traditional forms of administrative control over the populace?"

An obvious choice would be to gather artifacts which have played an important role in Bahari history for this purpose.\nThe office of the court chamberlain has identified two heirlooms whose current owners might be persuaded to cede them to the royal household in return for a generous show of appreciation, some minor privileges. However, due to ancient dynastic rivalries both insist that only their heirloom may be turned into a symbol of our Akalate, and refuse to entertain the notion that both might be elevated to the status of regalia.\nWe must therefore make a choice between these two artifacts. On one hand, the Blackthorn Crown of Zirru the Leper, one of the Akaltar-Magi or ‘Wise Mage Kings’, who ruled Aqatbar in the decades after the Day of Ashen Skies, uniting all of Bahar and extending its reach to the shores of Milcorissia. On the other Hand, the Moonsilver Blade of Parxares the Great, who threw off the gnollish yoke over Bahar in the century after the Aakhetan Wars and forged a once more proud and united Bahari Akalate.\nWhich of these storied heirlooms is worthy to adorn our glorious Akal?"

Centuries ago, after the Council of Brasan proclaimed its falsehoods as righteous doctrine, our forebears in the faith gathered in this town to practice their belief in secret and shelter the true faith as they knew it. There they led a peaceful life of quiet devotion to Surakel. But the scourges of Taelarios were not satisfied with merely branding them as heretics and forcing them to publicly disavow their beliefs.\nNo, on a fell day in 1220 the vile arch-heretic Taelarios and his thugs amongst the Order of the Zenith stormed into the city, utterly convinced of their righteousness, yet unwittingly serving the Dark. Thus began the week-long ‘Purge of Medurubar’, a monstrous transgression that will live on in infamy for all time. The faithful were dragged from their homes, condemned in a mockery of true justice and burned alive by the thousands. The whole city became one horrendous pyre worthy of a Xhazobine. After the ashes settled, a quarter of the city’s inhabitants had died, and many more, our cherished ancestors among them, had left Medurubar in desperate flight.\nAs for Taelarios, his thirst for cruelty was not yet sated and he made Medurubar his new capital, erecting his palace on the ashes of his victims. But justice finally prevailed, and we now hold sway over the city. No longer shall the sacrifice of our ancestors be scorned or forgotten - we shall take the vainglorious monuments to Taelarios’ pride and turn them into sombre memorials."

The last revellers stumbling on their way home from a night of carousing and the few workers already preparing themselves for a new day of honest labor were greeted by a peculiar sight. Out of the east, at first obscured by the light of the rising sun, a quintet of dark spots could be seen high up in the sky approaching the city. A flock of large birds? A harpy raiding party? The curiosity of the onlookers was soon sated as it became clear that the mystery approaching them was a group of flying carpets who began their landing approach on one of the roof terraces of the akal’s palace.\nThose sufficiently tuned into the palace grapevine soon heard outlandish rumours. A group of human and elven mages hailing from one of the Mašnsih tribes of the far Salahad had come to offer their services to the akal in recognition of his righteous cause. Led by Kišar of the szal-Fazil, a raven haired beauty with piercing aquamarine eyes and adorned with an intricate swirling web of turquoise tattoos and body paint that glittered in the morning sun and almost seemed to move of its own accord, this delegation has presented the Akal with an intriguing proposition. In return for shelter and support in their quest for further knowledge, the oppressed mages of Surakeš represented by them are willing to employ their occult talents in the name of our sacred cause.\nA consensus among the royal council was soon reached, whether due to purely pragmatic reasons or an earnest wish to revive this part of our ancient heritage, and the akal formally accepted the pact, promising the mysterious newcomer a place amongst his closest advisors and the full support of Dartaxâgerdim in the noble endeavour of reviving the ancient art of the Magušim."

We ourselves undertook the first steps when we gathered under the banner of Dartaxes and put an end to banditry and lawlessness in the reaches of northern Birzartanšes. And with each step forward our gait grew bolder, until every step of our mighty realm shook the earth. Now we stand astride Surakeš, the sacred Garden of Surakel, ready to fend off any challenger attempting to intrude upon our sacred homeland with flaming sword in hand.\nIt has been a long, circuitous journey from rebel king ruling over a fractious pack of mercenaries, fanatics, peasant rebels and outcasts, to warden of Bahar and protector of the faithful, and finally to the undisputed overlord of the center of existence, the cradle of civilisation, this eternal garden basking in His glorious Light.\nAh, what a resplendent journey it was!"

At court, the divergent options are the topic of many fiery arguments. Representatives of the moderate majority amongst our followers suggest that, as long as the elves keep to their proper station from now on, it would be utter folly to frivolously divest ourselves of their talents and exiling them would only mean once more devastating the areas they have painstakingly recovered for civilisation after their arrival in Bahar.\nThe nobility tends towards the opinion that a proper penitence is required for all elves whose continued presence in our lands we tolerate. For their supercilious attempt to lord over the true children of Surakel they must now become servants of those they have oppressed.\nYet for some radical hotheads amongst the Šebhuliam, these measures are not acceptable, as they consider the complete expulsion of all elves from the soil of Bahar a necessary step in the cleansing of our homeland. Failure to agree with their demands is swiftly rebuked with accusations of impiety and spiritual corruption."

No longer shall they spread their lies unhindered, we will return the true teachings of the Sun Cult to their former subjects instead.\nThe ultimate architect of this affront against the true faith, Taelarios, is entombed at the heart of the city, within a vast and gaudy mausoleum.

With the shining city of Gišhuram and its inhabitants now in our hands, we must carefully decide on our next steps. While some decisions are easily made, such as the transfer of the rarest and most precious magical tomes and artifacts to our newly established academy on the shores of lake Garlas, our Eka-Uššupammun - the ‘Palace whose Foundations Hide Knowledge’.\nOther choices are much more contentious. While they attempted to hide all evidence of their foul deeds, the inner circle of magi around Karodir Varamzuir, former akal of Varamhar and archmage in his own right, could not deceive the faithful servants of Surakel who oversaw their arrest. It appears that they were involved in an arcane experiment of heretofore unimaginable magnitude and depravity, nothing less than an attempt to craft a false god of light with nothing but foul sorcery.\nOf course, once news of this truly disturbing secret reached them, the Šebhuliam howled for the blood of the self-proclaimed ‘White Phoenix’ Karodir and all who abetted him. But as our loyal troops are in full control of both his prison and the city as a whole we are not obligated to cater to their every whims. Instead, some of the more pragmatic voices on the royal council have suggested sparing the life of him and his accomplices in return for unhindered access of our own magi to all the magical secrets and hidden knowledge these heretics have plundered from ancient Bulwari sources and devised themselves during the many years of their research."

At the end of this fateful day much of Sareyand was engulfed in flames, from its densely packed rookeries and labourer quarters to the elegant villas of the elven nobility and the Ash Palace, which in a tragic repetition of history once more fell victim to flames kindled by conflict.\nLearning from the storming of Medurubar, the noble officers participating in the siege lost no time and sought out the elven quarter to ensure that the murderous fervor of the Šebhuliam found no easy victims this time, instead safeguarding those amongst their elven counterparts who swore to submit to the akal’s justice.\nTheir counterparts at court have been most persuasive in their argument to have the elves serve their proper penance by instructing our soldiers in the unique training regime that gave the vaunted Ash Legion their edge over almost any opponent they faced. Unsurprisingly, the representatives of the Šebhuliam rebuke this proposal in the harshest imaginable terms, stopping only short of accusing their aristocratic rivals of being heretics of the worst kind, interfering with the execution of Surakel’s justice for their own gain."

Any member of the royal household joining their ranks became just another warrior of the faith, while any scion of the Šebhuliam clans marrying into the royal house transferred their loyalties to their new home.\nHowever, this might change, as the royal heir has expressed interest in becoming initiated in the ranks of the Šebhuliam and studying their secret teachings. This has caught the attention of the leaders of the Šebhuliam, who have extended an invitation for the heir to join their ranks.\nThe akal is now faced with a difficult decision.

We may not be able to craft Wishblades like they are described in our legends, but the inscripted tools of the Kurešimi can provide an immense benefit for our craftsmen.

The Szalmušar thus command the absolute loyalty of the thousands of shock troops that make up an integral part of the akalate's armies.\nBut the current head of the Szalmušar clan has set his sights on a lofty goal - he wants to establish the hereditary position of supreme spiritual arbiter of the realm, the high kašra, entitled to dictate matters of doctrine even to the Kašra of the major temples in our realm.\nThis would create a spiritual counterpart to the temporal role of the akal, turning our akalate into something akin to a Diarchy, where the power is shared between akal and high kašra. Royal advisors not under the influence of the Szalmušar have swiftly pointed out the potential long term risks to the stability of the realm and have instead suggested to create the position of high kašra but merge it inextricably with the role of akal, turning it into a rulership both temporal and spiritual."

Our armies need to enforce the will of our Akal and be ready to advance our borders in all directions while deterring any would-be invader. For this, we need to invest in the formation of an elite core of our armies, the Dartaxian Legions. Their role will be to anchor our auxiliary troops in battle and smash through the lines of the enemy. By studying and combining the methods of our vanquished foes, the famed Ash Legions of Sareyand first among them, with our own training regiment and providing superior equipment funded by the imperial treasury we will establish a superior fighting force without equal."
 dartaxagerdim_events.30.db:0 "A righteous empire of the faithful such as ours can only continue to fulfill its sacred duties with a mighty military fit to vanquish any foe and fend off any hostile incursion of the servants of the Dark. For this, we need to invest in the formation of an elite core of our armies, the Dartaxian Legions. Their role will be to anchor our auxiliary troops in battle and smash through the lines of the enemy. And who would be better suited for this than our valiant Šebhuliam, who have proven their utter devotion to our cause time and time again."
 dartaxagerdim_events.30.a:0 "Let all the world quake beneath our footsteps."
 dartaxagerdim_events.30.b:0 "We are Surakel's sword!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.50.t:0 "The Šebhuliam Seize a Noble's Estate"
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.d:0 "A council of Šebhuliam-aligned clerics have found a prominent local noble guilty of heresy, for which the customary punishment is burning at the stake, his lands and possessions devolving on to the royal treasury. Many of the noble's allies have come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to plead for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] intercession on behalf of the condemned. At the same time, representatives of the Šebhuliam have also arrived at the royal palace, urging the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to not interfere with matters of faith."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.a:0 "The Šebhuliam overstep their bounds. Clear the noble of all charges."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.b:0 "Our Faith must be kept pure. Heresy cannot be tolerated."

 dartaxagerdim_events.51.t:0 "Šebhuliam Request Land for a New Stronghold"
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.d:0 "The Šebhuliam have long held out against the attacks of the kingdom of Birzartanšes, using their network of unassailable fortifications centered around the Kuzak Mountains to foil any attempt to subdue and eradicate them. These remote redoubts have ensured their survival for decades and have in turn evolved to serve as strongholds and centers of operations for the Šebhuliam as the Akalate has expanded.\nWith the recent conquests of new territories the Šebhuliam have expressed a desire to establish a new stronghold in these lands to anchor their presence there and act as a hub for their efforts in this province."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.a:0 "Strengthening the Šebhuliam means strengthening the akalate."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.b:0 "They have enough as it stands, the time of constant sieges is over."

 dartaxagerdim_events.52.t:0 "An Invitation from the Serpent"
 dartaxagerdim_events.52.d:0 "After arriving at the mage academy on the shores of lake Garlas, our Akal has been received with all honours by the heads of the academy. During the banquet in his honor many speeches were held exhorting the wisdom of our Akal to continue to support the efforts in uncovering the lost secrets of our magical heritage and how it is the birthright of every magically gifted Bulwari to study the arcane lore of his ancestors and wield the power that stems from it. After the festivities have reached their end late in the evening and most participants have already stumbled towards their quarters, our Akal is approached by a group of senior mages who request a discreet audience with him. They reveal that they are emissaries of a hidden sorcerous cabal striving to work for the greater good of all Bulwari by uncovering the lost secrets of the Magušim art and return Bulwari magic to its rightful place. What exactly that would entail is left somewhat vague in their presentation. They explain that they have been granted permission to invite the Akal into their ranks. While the Akal is not a scholar of magic or ancient history, even he has heard tales of the followers of Hašahu, the Serpent-king, who have espoused very similar goals."
 dartaxagerdim_events.52.a:0 "An intriguing offer to consider..."

 dartaxagerdim_events.53.t:0 "Silence in the Garden"
 dartaxagerdim_events.53.da:0 "The forked tongue of the serpent may whisper the sweetest promises, but any true child of Surakel knows of the poison hidden behind it. Upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] return from the academy of Eka-Uššupammun [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered his closest advisors for a closed session of the royal council. Only supernaturally observant onlookers with eyes everywhere at once might have stood a chance to notice the complicated dance that ensued, with cryptic messages and signals passed on from courtiers attending the akal’s council to palace servants and in turn to plain tradesmen, simple soldiers and many others. But the results of this clandestine operation were far from subtle.\nThe mages of Eka-Uššupammun were soon greeted by the sight of a small army encamped along the shore of lake Garlas, consisting of our most elite soldiers and those amongst the Kairu mages whose loyalty was beyond question.\nWe will eradicate these poisonous vipers that have burrowed deep into the bosom of Bulwari magic. These treacherous acolytes of Hašahu, the current head of the szal-Fazil, Zerafak, first among them, will rue the day they tried to suborn our righteous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 dartaxagerdim_events.53.db:0 "From the times of Brasan the Emancipator onwards, magic has been the birthright of all Bulwari, and more often than not, the sign of a ruler blessed by Surakel.\nIt is only fitting then, with our hold over all of Bulwar that we turn to this most venerable tradition and take on the mantle of mage-king. With the aid of a most sacred rite faithfully preserved by the scholars of the Cult of the Serpent the slumbering arcane potential within our exalted [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can be kindled, like the flames of a bonfire ignited by a focussed ray of sunlight. Given our unmatched mastery of the arcane arts, the ceremony was of course a complete success. At its completion, the maga leading the rite, possessed of an ethereal beauty with cerulean eyes, lost her stern countenance and broke out in a secretive smile and intoned ‘Praised be the Serpent-king, all shall bear witness to his destined return!’.\nJust as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is no longer a mere [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but the All-knowing Serpent, rightful successor of Hašahu, we are no longer merely Dartaxâgerdim, but a Mušaskalam reborn, ready to remind an unsuspecting world of the sublime might of Bulwari magic."
 dartaxagerdim_events.53.a:0 "Ever onwards towards our destiny we stride!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.54.t:0 "Followers of Dartaxes"
 dartaxagerdim_events.54.d:0 "A mere eight years have passed since our former overlords in Birsartansbar were forced to accept our independence in a formal peace treaty. While both sides know that this peace cannot last while both still stand, this uneasy truce has bought us the desperately needed time to transform our loose coalition of religious fanatics, soldiers loyal to a rebellious general and the desperate inhabitants of a borderland tired of constant conflict into a true akalate.\nWhile we are proud to call ourselves followers of Dartaxes - Dartaxâgerdim - some voices amongst our newly assembled court have suggested adopting another official name might provide our holy cause with much needed legitimacy in the eyes of the wider world.\nMany have suggested to take on the mantle of the venerable kingdom of Akal-Uakbar, whose ancient capital we have chosen as the seat of our akalate. Others are convinced that naming ourselves after the home province of Dartaxes, Farramaz, would send a strong signal of unity to all our detractors.\nWhile the Šebulhiam are in favor of keeping the name that served us well during the Great Rebellion and the subsequent independence war against both Birsartanšes and Baharkand, the nobles of our new lands have been very persuasive in their attempts to convince Dartaxes to adopt a name that is suitable for a true realm that is more than just a motley collection of bandits, cutthroats and turncoats."
 dartaxagerdim_events.54.a:0 "We shall remain Dartaxâgerdim until all of Baharšes is freed!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.54.b:0 "Akal-Uak is the natural choice for a capital and Akal-Uakbar our proper name!"
