 Y65_begin_deforestation_desc:0 "As our nation expands, so too does their desire for land to live on. As luck would have it, there are vast stretches of rainforest under our nominal control. Plans have been drawn up by our ministers to utilise the army to deforest large swathes of the jungle and reveal the arable land beneath for our settlers and farmers."

 Y65_countryside_conversions_desc:0 "Unable to cower beneath the shade of their rainforest, the dark heresies of our countryside can finally be exposed to the light.

 Y65_oust_the_binhrung_desc:0 "The dominion of the Kai over the Binhrung coast has hindered our trade efforts to the east, while their military ambitions in the Lupulan Rainforest competes with our own. The Lupulan Peninsula only has room for one regional power, and we intend to make sure it is us, not the Kai."

 Y65_western_arrivals_title:0 "Western Arrivals"
 Y65_western_arrivals_desc:0 "Coming from strange lands from around the cape of Sarhal, the Cannorians bring extraordinary technology and an enterprising, mercantile culture not unlike our own. They also bring with them a sense of religious unity, apparently forged in their homeland in the wake of several great wars of religion. Our people have already become fascinated with these Cannorians and what they have to teach us."

 Y65_welcome_their_traders_title:0 "Welcome Their Traders"
 Y65_welcome_their_traders_desc:0 "Offering a generous fee, the Cannorians have requested the use of our ports and shipping lanes. In return, along with the upfront payment, they have offered to help us reform our own trading techniques to become more in line with the rapidly globalising trade economy they have established over their own home continent and the new world beyond the Sea of the Lost. They also promise the potential of future cooperation between our people."

 Y65_welcome_their_officers_title:0 "Welcome Their Veterans"
 Y65_welcome_their_officers_desc:0 "In exchange for a small payment, our Cannorian partners have offered to send us some of their veteran officers in order to refine our military. They promise to bring it closer to their modern ideal, both technologically and tactically. Already our generals have created strategies to use these newfound military advantages against our neighbours."

 Y65_modernized_army_title:0 "Modernised Army"
 Y65_modernized_army_desc:0 "With the aid of our Cannorian partners, we are confident that our armies, although smaller perhaps than many of our neighbours, will be a force to reckon with through technological supremacy. Our tactics and weaponry will eclipse the old fashioned armies of the ancient nations of Haless.\n\nArawkelin’s time in the sun has come."

 Y65_drill_the_troops_title:0 "Drill The Troops"
 Y65_drill_the_troops_desc:0 "For too long our army has languished, resting upon the laurels of its Phoenix Legion origins. It has served for too long as simply a guard against the encroaching jungle. For us to truly push back against the foul spirits that dwell within the wilds, we must assault them in such force that even the jungle will bend."

 Y65_reign_in_the_expedition_title:0 "Rein In The Expedition"
 Y65_reign_in_the_expedition_desc:0 "The Brenulan Expedition, sent into the jungle long ago by a Yanglam king and placed under the control of Arawkelin, has since become increasingly autonomous. These desires of freedom culminated in their treacherous rebellion. But now, with our army modernised, we will bring our expedition to heel, and return them to their original purpose."

 Y65_conquer_kuta_title:0 "Conquer Kuta"
 Y65_conquer_kuta_desc:0 "The Yanglam city of Kuta, while tiny, is nonetheless positioned around a natural harbour. Their geographical importance threatens our mercantile control over the region with all sorts of folk gathering in their ports instead of ours: pirates, other merchants, and even the mysterious sea elves shelter there beyond our control.\n\nWhile plans for their conquest are being drawn up by our generals, important merchants within our nation have already begun schemes to shift trade from their harbour, to the fortress of Aksa Sanuyego."

 Y65_expand_into_the_interior_title:0 "Expand Into The Interior"
 Y65_expand_into_the_interior_desc:0 "With the Brenulan Expedition back under our rightful control, the time has come for them to once again expand into the forest.

 Y65_root_out_the_mystic_accord_title:0 "Root Out The Mystic Accord"
 Y65_root_out_the_mystic_accord_desc:0 "With our control over the Lupulan undisputed, the time has begun to purge the last remnant of spirit worship from the continent.\n\nFor too long the people of the jungle have been shackled to these aloof and uncaring beings. For them to truly be free, they must embrace our philosophy and see the tyranny of the otherworldly beings they have been living in servitude under."

 Y65_integrate_the_expedition_title:0 "Integrate The Expedition"
 Y65_integrate_the_expedition_desc:0 "With the Lupulan Rainforest purged of the influence of spirits, the Brenulan expedition has served its purpose. While many within the expedition feel they have developed their own culture, the truth is that they were always part of Arawkelin, and the administration of their lands is our right alone.\n\nIt is time for them to return to the fold, and for their military administration to be dissolved."

 Y65_kelino_syncretism_title:0 "Kelino Syncretism"
 Y65_kelino_syncretism_desc:0 "The Kelino culture has always been a blend of many disparate peoples, and, with the addition of the Lupulan tribes to that melange, it has become even more so. None on Haless are more welcoming of strangers than us, and none more accepting of even the most bizarre foreign customs. Those we rule live in peace, assured of our magnanimity."

 Y65_first_halessi_gnomes_title:0 "First Halessi Gnomes"
 Y65_first_halessi_gnomes_desc:0 "The traders from Cannor have brought with them a bizarre folk, a race of short humanoids, not unlike the dwarves of the Hinphat, except slighter in their build. Similarly to the dwarves, these so called gnomes have a penchant for creation, although unlike the master dwarven artisans, they delight in strange and wondrous artifice. Already their peculiar inventions have gained popularity in our trade ports as novelties, although some of their creations are undeniably useful."

 Y65_attract_the_gommo_title:0 "Attract the Gommo"
 Y65_attract_the_gommo_desc:0 "Having brought the first gnomish innovators to Haless, it would serve us well to allow their influence in the country to expand in exchange for their insights on artificery. The gnomes we have invited to settle tell us of an international organization run by their fellow gnomes that is wholly dedicated to the pursuit of artificery.\n\nMembers of this “Gommo” establish branch offices around the world to better study areas and topics of interest to them, creating an increasingly global network of artificery centers. With a demonstration of artificer expertise and our sources of arcane precursor relics that have become available recently, we may be able to convince the Gommo to establish such a center of innovation within Arawkelin."

 Y65_welcome_their_missionaries_title:0 "Welcome Their Preachers"
 Y65_welcome_their_missionaries_desc:0 "Our Cannorian brothers in the Ravelian faith have come to us with an offer: they wish to form their own expedition into the jungle to spread our faith.\n\nWhile their techniques are unconventionally violent, usually converting whole villages at gunpoint, it is undeniable they are effective. These rifle missionaries are merely waiting on our assent to begin their work."

 Y65_convert_the_countryside_title:0 "Convert The Countryside"
 Y65_convert_the_countryside_desc:0 "As we converted the heretics of the rainforest to High Philosophy, so now must we convert them to Ravelian. Our faith will spread like a raging fire, bringing light to the unenlightened, and power to the disenfranchised. As we cast off the shackles of spirits, we will now cast off the shackles of the new tyrants: those who seek to control knowledge and magic for their own."

 Y65_a_bright_new_age_title:0 "A Bright New Age"
 Y65_a_bright_new_age_desc:0 "Arawkelin’s destiny was always to bring light to the dark places of the peninsula, and through fervour and wealth and knowledge we have. We need now only to take the last steps, to place the final pieces and usher in a bright new age for the Kelino people of Arawkelin."

 Y65_prepare_the_fleet_title:0 "Prepare The Fleet"
 Y65_prepare_the_fleet_desc:0 "For our nation to establish its dominance over the Lupulan peninsula, we must first secure its waters. For too long the pirates of Pinghoi have harried any shipping passing through the Merchant’s Gate.\n\nWe must prepare ourselves not only to defend our shores, but to strike back at hostile navies."

 Y65_dread_queen_no_more_title:0 "Dread Queen No More"
 Y65_dread_queen_no_more_desc:0 "The Dread Queen of Pinghoi has taken control of many of the nearby Ringlet Islands, giving her fleets free range in the Ringlet Sea to swiftly strike at merchants, then retreat into her island ports. We must mitigate her control, invading the islands with our improved fleet and superior army to once again secure the Bay of Lupulan for merchant shipping."

 Y65_finish_the_pirates_title:0 "Finish The Pirates"
 Y65_finish_the_pirates_desc:0 "The pirates of Pinghoi took advantage of the Tamran’s weakness during their civil war to take the port city of Cây Cam Sinh. Now that we have weakened the pirates, we have an opportunity to press the advantage and obliterate their lawless ways once and for all."

 Y65_expand_yan_contacts_title:0 "Expand Yan Contacts"
 Y65_expand_yan_contacts_desc:0 "An unending torrent of trade flows from the mouth of the Yanshen and one need only reach in their hand to find it coated with gold.\n\nWe must find a point to gain access to its wealth: an ally in the region where our merchants can find safe harbour. Then we will be able to divert some of the trade into our own hands."

 Y65_control_the_eastern_shipping_lanes_title:0 "The Eastern Shipping Lanes"
 Y65_control_the_eastern_shipping_lanes_desc:0 "As our influence along the northern coasts continues to grow, the presence of our ships in its waters has become commonplace. It is time to make a concerted effort to solidify our ambitions in the region. We will dominate their trade through our naval majesty alone, so that all the treasures of the Yan might flow south into our coffers."

 Y65_our_northern_brothers_in_faith_title:0 "Our Northern Brothers"
 Y65_our_northern_brothers_in_faith_desc:0 "The state of Feiten is surrounded by their religious enemies, just like us. With trade burgeoning along the coastline, many in our court see Feiten’s position as an opportunity to secure the region and ensure peace and growing prosperity.\n\nWe are confident that they will feel much the same way, with time."

 Y65_a_stable_source_of_food_title:0 "A Stable Source of Food"
 Y65_a_stable_source_of_food_desc:0 "Unlike the other great cities of the continent, Arawkelin cannot support itself through imported food from provincial agriculture, instead needing to dedicate significant amounts of the city’s own manpower to food production. With our nation’s growing wealth, it is vital we rectify this situation, so that Arawkelin can prosper to its fullest potential."

 Y65_new_cities_of_the_lupulan_title:0 "New Cities of The Lupulan"
 Y65_new_cities_of_the_lupulan_desc:0 "As Arawkelin City prospers, many look to it as an example, seeking to found new cities within the deep jungles of the Lupulan. By aiding in these pioneering efforts, wealth will flow from deep within the jungle, as these burgeoning cities begin to take after their inspiration."

 Y65_teak_furniture_title:0 "Teak Furniture"
 Y65_teak_furniture_desc:0 "The jungle of Lupulan’s greatest resource is its bounty of rare and valuable wood. Furniture wrought from their timber can fetch extraordinary prices on both foreign and domestic markets. By monopolising the production of teak furniture, we can ensure that it is our products they buy, and our trading ports they return to."

 Y65_welcome_their_wares_title:0 "Welcome Their Wares"
 Y65_welcome_their_wares_desc:0 "Arriving in their peculiar, bulbous ships, the Cannorians bring with them many treasures from their homeland: works of fine craftsmanship, bizarre gnomish inventions, but most valuable of all are their weapons of war.\n\nIf we move swiftly to establish ourselves as the principal point of trade from the west, we can take advantage of all their technological marvels and the desire for their goods. Kelino trading power will dominate the continent."

 Y65_modernized_navy_title:0 "Modernised Navy"
 Y65_modernized_navy_desc:0 "Our navy has always relied on its light, swift ships to dominate trade and suppress piracy. Now, as our nation takes its place on the global stage, it is only right that we spend the effort to make our armada of light ships the greatest in the world. With new, more mobile cannons, gnomish copper plated hulls, and rigging aided by artifice, the Arawkelin fleet will be feared and respected by every trade nation on Halann."

 Y65_monopolized_shipping_lanes_title:0 "Monopoly in Halann"
 Y65_monopolized_shipping_lanes_desc:0 "There isn’t a port in the world our ships haven’t visited. From Haless, to Cannor, to far Aelantir, the Arawkelin navy is present in every ocean in the world, representing and protecting our mercantile interests.\n\nEven the sight of the red and blue pennant flying above the mast can turn the most fearsome pirate into an honest sailor, and the mere presence of our navy makes foreign traders far more amenable to business with us."

 Y65_aksa_pusoayan_title:0 "Aksa Pusoayan"
 Y65_aksa_pusoayan_desc:0 "In the heart of the Ringlet Isles lies Gamdou, a former port of the pirates of Pinghoi. Now that we have purged them from the region, its true potential can be realised.\n\nNot only will Gamdou function as our own principal port, it will also be made a great fortress in the heart of the isles. It will serve as both as a defensive measure against any others with piratical ambitions and also as an expansive port from where we might field our grand fleet against our foes."

 Y65_lupulan_lumber_shipyards_title:0 "Lupulan Shipyards"
 Y65_lupulan_lumber_shipyards_desc:0 "In our solemn mission of taming the Lupulan rainforest to build a new home for our people, we have come to set up numerous logging operations to clear the land. As these logging projects begin to expand operations, we find our capital overflowing with excess supply of timber, a resource we know how to use well. Every great tree felled in the interior shall now find its way to the coasts of Arawkelin. Here, our workers may process the inevitable byproduct of clearing our home into new ships for an ever grander fleet."

 Y65_expand_the_fleets_title:0 "Expand the Fleets"
 Y65_expand_the_fleets_desc:0 "As our influence over trade around the peninsula has grown, the demand from our traders for protection has increased with it.

 Y65_yan_kelino_title:0 "Yan Kelino"
 Y65_yan_kelino_desc:0 "As our hold over the Ringlet isles grows firmer, the Yan people of the northern islands have grown closer to our own culture. The only thing standing in the way of full integration as Martao now is their religion. Once converted, they should happily join our great state."

 Y65_found_the_ringlet_company_title:0 "Found the Ringlet Company"
 Y65_found_the_ringlet_company_desc:0 "The Ringlet Isles are the original home of our people, and they have been severely depopulated since the rise of our realm as a great magical plague and famines befell the islands. These islands, while not remotely comparable to our grand city of Arawkelin, still are a critical region for commerce and rare trade goods, with traders passing through regularly on their way to and from Yanshen. Some enterprising merchants have already begun clamoring at court for the king to sponsor a colonial company dedicated to settling the islands and thus securing our control of the Ringlet Sea and its wealth. Surely, our distant kin would appreciate us returning home."

 Y65_settle_the_ringlet_isles_title:0 "Settle the Ringlet Isles"
 Y65_settle_the_ringlet_isles_desc:0 "When our ships docked at the isle of Lanobuk, they received a hospitable welcome from the descendants of the Gataw who remained. We fielded many questions about life in Arawkelin and what the ways of the world were beyond the islands they knew. Our hosts obsessed endlessly over the many goods we brought that were heretofore unknown in the Ringlet Isles. We promised them our return would mean an end to the cycle of stagnation and collapse which has plagued the Ringlet Isles for the last centuries.\n\nAnother group inhabiting these waters soon drew our attention, as well: the merfolk. It would seem that our presence here has become too great for them to ignore, and they have sent an envoy to discuss the intentions behind our presence here. It would be wise to listen to what they have to say, masters of the waters that they are."

 Y65_merfolk_alliance_title:0 "Merfolk Alliance"
 Y65_merfolk_alliance_desc:0 "Since our landing at Lanobuk, the merfolk have been more receptive to human activity, likely viewing us with more curiosity than the Gataw they are familiar with. The villagers on the island speak of the merfolk helping to guide their boats, but when asked about receiving the same favor our diplomats have been repeatedly refused. Having the assistance of the merfolk in matters of ship navigation and commerce would undoubtedly assist the goal of turning the Ringlet Isles into a great center of business, and perhaps even improve our navigational abilities abroad. Maybe a diplomatic show of goodwill to the communities at Lanobuk might change their minds."

 Y65_sarhal_haless_searout_desc:0 "The Merfolk Proposal has provided us with a powerful new business partner. The merfolk of the Ringlet Isles can now be counted on to help guide our boats far beyond where they have traditionally sailed. This venture can bring us to a shore our merchants used to see maybe once in a lifetime: Sarhal. Here, too, merfolk dwell beneath the waves, and the winds of trade blow more fairly than we could ever imagine. Establishing a privileged route of commerce for our merchants to cross from the shores of southern Haless to Sarhal is sure to bring in wealth far beyond our wildest imaginations."

 Y65_more_than_just_a_fort_desc:0 "As Aska Sanuyego grows in importance, so does the community that has formed around it. No longer a mere fort and trading post, many in our nation now consider it their home with a bustling city flourishing around the majestic, Jaherian fortress.\n\nAs we continue to develop the city, more will come, growing the already present communities of elves and half elves into a truly metropolitan light amidst the dark jungles of Lupulan."

 Y65_land_in_the_coffee_coast_title:0 "Land in the Coffee Coast"
 Y65_land_in_the_coffee_coast_desc:0 "One of the goods that flows freely along the coasts of Sarhal is greatly coveted back home in Haless. Coffee is a signature good of Bamaliwuni, having earned it the moniker of the “Coffee Coast.” Having gained direct access to this region, it is high time we made an effort to corner the market for this delectable beverage that is sought out in public houses and palaces across Haless. Our boats may freely ply the waters, but our merchants need a local base, a safe entrepot to store the harvest, where they can conduct their business from. Rimvuawuni will serve this purpose perfectly, provided we can seize the port."

 Y65_encroach_into_the_jungle_title:0 "Encroach into the Jungle"
 Y65_encroach_into_the_jungle_desc:0 "With the early success of the Coffee Coast venture, our merchants are eager to expand the fields that now grow coffee to meet the ever growing demand, planning large plantations rarely seen before in the region. Even now they clamor for expanding beyond the port outpost of Rimvuawuni, aiming to control Bamaliwuni outright and set up true plantations, like those we established in the deforested Lupulan.\n\nSuch encroachment may provoke the ire of the remaining independent states in Bamaliwuni, but they simply cannot understand the potential wealth they squander by sitting upon their valuable lands. This land could very well become one great plantation of coffee. Who are we, to ignore such a lucrative opportunity?"

 Y65_kings_of_coffe_trade_title:0 "Kings of the Coffee Trade"
 Y65_kings_of_coffe_trade_desc:0 "We stand as undisputed masters of Sarhal’s Coffee Coast, but the work has yet to commence on truly turning this land into a veritable garden for its signature produce. For now, our merchants and their laborers harvest coffee plants in the harsh jungle environment, an exhausting and time consuming process.\n\nWith the unprecedented success of deforestation of the Lupulan to support our growing kingdom, our traders argue there is no reason Bamaliwuni could not be transformed in a similar manner. Deforestation would solve multiple issues, making the Coffee Coast much more habitable, but most importantly, wildly profitable."

The nation’s finest minds are desperately searching for a solution."

 flavour_arawkelin.16.d:0 "For the last decade, Arawkelin has been laid low. The city that stands as a proud testament to the tenacity of Hanto Hanto and his inception of the Kelino people has not seen a threat like the pirate queen Ping Shuang since the Padhahkan of Lembingtana, who almost single-handedly held back further Kelino encroachment upon the native Yanglam until 1271. For a kingdom and people that have weathered the test of time and once even were elevated to the role of bulwark of the Phoenix Empire, very little of that past glory seems to remain.\n\nGone is the great fleet that once kept the kingdom and its interests safe across Haless, stolen by the pirate queen, now ruling the pirate republic of Pinghoi. Likewise gone is much of the once bustling commerce that allowed the city to thrive, now threatened by the very fleet that once protected it. The centuries-old desire for Arawkelin to assert dominance over the Lupulan has also waned, with the Brenulan expedition largely left to their own devices.\n\nIf the kingdom is to emerge from these dark times, it must remind both land and sea that Arawkelin is a city worthy of reverence just as the radiant sun above."

 flavour_arawkelin.17.d:0 "Many of the legacies the Sun Elves left behind in Haless are left crumbling or forgotten, subsumed by the endless cycles of imperial rise and collapse that color much of Halessi history. One monument that stands in defiance of this cycle is the Citadel of the Flaming Leaf, Aksa Sanuyego.\n\nOn orders from Jaher himself, a naval bastion rivaling any the world had seen before was raised on the edge of the Lupulan, protecting the commerce flowing between the Phoenix Empire’s great cities of Sramaya and Tianlou and administered under the watchful eye of his faithful new Kelino allies. The Phoenix Empire may be long gone, and yet the fortress remains.\n\nNow, it furthers the interests of those who have faithfully maintained it, those that outlasted the empire. Due to this citadel, Arawkelin projects a naval dominance over the Ringlet Sea and Gulf of Rahen that is unthinkable to rival, much less dismantle. Much of that power ultimately depends on this stronghold, rebuilt and refurbished after centuries of habitation to stand as a testament to the power the Kelino hold as the middlemen of Halessi trade."

 flavour_arawkelin.18.d:0 "When the Kelino of Arawkelin had just begun their centuries-long endeavor to build a home in the Lupulan, their city had an equal, and her name was Kuta. Equally ambitious and equally determined to dominate the local Yanglam tribes. For generations, the sailors of Arawkelin and Kuta competed over the sea routes used by the ships rounding their coast bound towards bigger cities.\n\nNot long ago, Kuta received an unexpected blessing in the form of the pirate queen, Ping Shuang, who laid low their rival. Yet they failed to consider that this blessing might also become a curse. The lax attitude of Kuta towards the pirates of Pinghoi and their cruel affairs channeled much ill-gotten wealth into the pockets of Kuta’s elite, who had grown accustomed to such lucrative dealings and refused to move with the changing times. They foolishly believed that the pirates they empowered would always come to their defense.\n\nThe loyalty of pirates, however, is not something to rely upon, as we have shown. Today Kuta kneels before its sister city, its rulers deposed and exiled and the debauched depredations of their reign laid bare. Many of those who prospered in this den of thieves now leave for greener pastures as Kuta is poised to be subsumed into the Kingdom of Arawkelin, further weakening the stranglehold of piracy on Halessi shores."

 flavour_arawkelin.19.d:0 "As our efforts to transform the Lupulan into a prosperous land are well underway, the wealth that is extracted from the jungle flows to but one city: Arawkelin. The shining City on the Sunharbour River, our capital has never known prosperity quite like this.\n\nWhile much of the success can indeed be traced to our clearing of the jungle, another source of prosperity has changed our society irreversibly. When the Cannorians showed up on the shores of Haless, many rulers had mixed opinions of their meddling in local affairs. Arawkelin, however, embraced them wholeheartedly just as they had embraced the Sun Elves.\n\nImporting works of science, art, literature, magic, and treatises on government, the Kelino have adopted Cannorian culture in a way few others have, transforming an already open-minded plutocracy into a truly modernized state. Cannorians themselves come in increasing numbers to Arawkelin to learn the ways of Haless and many attempt to make a living in our thriving industries.\n\nThe kingdom now stands as a beacon of enlightenment above the jungle whom it has forced to submit, bolstered by the embrace of new and powerful philosophies."

 flavour_arawkelin.20.d:0 "They appeared confused at first, hesitant to approach our boat. The Gataw fishermen who accompany us make complex hand gestures, indicating that we are friends an`d have no ill intent. Finally the merfolk surface, reaching out to the ropes we have thrown overboard. They hang on to stay with our ship and begin to speak in a limited vocabulary with the fishermen. Questions are exchanged, the merfolk pointing at us repeatedly and glancing in confusion. Who are we? Where did we come from? What do we want? The fishermen answer to the best of their ability, making hand motions to help the merfolk understand what our offer is.\n\nIn exchange for resources from above the waves to bolster their growing underwater kingdom, the merfolk are to help our ships make the passage from Haless to the rich coasts of Sarhal, where most of their brethren reside. In hopes to befriend the formerly isolated merfolk, gifts are exchanged; weapons, tools, examples of the treasures we extract from the Lupulan. The merfolk eye the gifts with great interest, conversing amongst each other for a few moments under the waves. Finally, one of the merfolk surfaces and exchanges a few words to the fishermen with a newfound warmth. One of the fishermen smiles and turns to us, clearly bearing good news."
