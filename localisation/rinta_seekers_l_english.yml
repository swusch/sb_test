 rinta_seeker_events.1.t: "Wandering Darwiiz"
 rinta_seeker_events.1.desc: "A wandering Darwiiz has appeared in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Darwiiz, as rural practitioners of witchdoctery and channeling, do not appear often in royal courts and upper class towns. This Darwiiz asks for hospitality, looking for a place to stay. He promises to reward [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s hospitality through the channeling of his magics to bring prosperity to [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s realm. While on one hand, the Darwiiz are well respected amongst the people, in higher class courts their counsel is often less trusted than the ideas of a Mwalim. In the end, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides to…"
 rinta_seeker_events.1.a: "Give the Darwiiz hospitality in the court"
 rinta_seeker_events.1.b: "Provide him somewhere else to sleep outside of court"
 rinta_seeker_events.1.c: "Prepare a feast, let us prove our faith in the Darwiiz!"
 rinta_seeker_events.1.d: "Have this man banished from our court!"

 rinta_seeker_events.2.t: "The Poetry Competition"
 rinta_seeker_events.2.desc: "As part of a minor local festival, a poetry competition is being held in [Root.Capital.GetName], with a multitude of skilled entrants. At each round of the competition, participants have been challenged to produce a verse on different aspects of our religion, such as the first Rinta Seeker Kabil Hadni or certain constellations, and the theme of the championship round is the sacred numbers. It has come down to two final competitors, each given the opportunity to deliver their verse before the court to be judged by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The first is a learned Mwalim, dressed in fine robes stitched with complex geometric patterns of many rich colors. His verse is technically perfect; the sum total of each line’s syllables creating a complex sequence of prime numbers and its content aptly capturing the significance of numerology in many facets of Baashidi life. The second contestant is an unassuming Darwiiz, barefoot and wearing ragged clothes. The verse he delivers is simple in its beauty, expressing a transcendent truth connecting sacred numbers to the grandeur of the natural world and its people. With both contestants finished, it is down to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide the victor."
 rinta_seeker_events.2.a: "The mystic’s poem exemplifies the essence of our faith"
 rinta_seeker_events.2.b: "The scholar’s poem is unmatched in its excellence!"

 rinta_seeker_events.3.t: "Books Of Wisdom"
 rinta_seeker_events.3.desc: "During a recent archaeological dig, certain books from scholars of old were found in fairly good condition. The only problem with them is that they seem to have been placed there purposely. Whoever dumped the books there is also assumed to be the reason why the books that we found had been written over with crazy ramblings. Looking at the books, it seems they could still be restored in some quality though, as the texts written by these scholars are still visible. We could take the time and attempt to remove the ink, restoring the original manuscripts to as fine a quality as possible, but it will cost us a good portion of money. Hopefully, the restored texts will provide us with broader knowledge of the world."
 rinta_seeker_events.3.a: "Let’s do it!"
 rinta_seeker_events.3.b: "Nah"

 rinta_seeker_events.20.t: "The Tale Of Nasiiye"
 rinta_seeker_events.20.desc: "Nasiiye of the Divine was a prophet from the 13th century who promoted ideas of peace and freedom for the impoverished, hoping for an era where death became a distant past. He was perhaps best known for his purple eyes, which held mystical powers that included seeing the future. As he was skilled in magic, he used his powers to help those recovering from the various wars and droughts that had riddled his home country of Beeragga. His word spread far and wide, and it was said that once Nasiiye crossed the borders to other countries, tranquility arrived alongside him. This unfortunately made him a target of those fighting in conflict, and thus, when he made a visit to Baddabi to spread his word, he was assassinated. To this day, Nasiiye has remained popular amongst the people, and those who see his word as truth find it saddening that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has not taken action to rectify the misdeeds of the past and to honor Nasiiye as a representative of the mystic ideology of Rinta Seekers. They call for something to be done to honor his legacy."
 rinta_seeker_events.20.a: "Provide a temple in his honor for people to enjoy"
 rinta_seeker_events.20.b: "Construct a statue in our capital for the people to enjoy"
 rinta_seeker_events.20.c: "Do nothing"

 rinta_seeker_events.21.t: "Prime Spirits"
 rinta_seeker_events.21.desc: "In Habab Zar, it is believed that some spirits, Prime Spirits, are so powerful that they return to our world after their first life, binding themselves to material existence to enact their sometimes esoteric agendas. This belief has always been controversial to the Rinta Seekers, who believe that the refined and erudite escape the physical world forever - the reincarnation of such learned souls implies an unsettling ignorance and retained attachment, not fitting with the great sages of history. Such conflicts are common in this faith, as where there are Seekers of Knowledge, there are also those who hold strong to the beliefs of Habab Zar.\n\nRecently, a very wealthy noble with many connections across our country perished. Due to his faith in the Habab Zar religion, many have called him a Prime Spirit, and as a strong and hardy soul. This has brought turmoil to the local community, as those who follow the Rinta Seekers faith consider this an act of heresy and demon worship. They demand the family renounce his status as a Prime Spirit. They come to the royal hall now to let [Root.Monarch.GetName] end the debate once and for all. The family begs and pleads for their kin to remain with a title sacred with them, and offer monetary compensation.\n\nWhat shall [Root.Monarch.GetName] do?"
 rinta_seeker_events.21.a: "Force them to stop using such heretical concepts!"
 rinta_seeker_events.21.b: "Let them do as they wish"

 rinta_seeker_events.22.t: "Knowledge Expedition"
 rinta_seeker_events.22.desc: "A small group of Darwiiz has called for an expedition into an undocumented part of our lands. Generally, the Darwiiz would voyage themselves with a small expedition, but on this occasion, the Darwiiz find themselves in need of backing from the government due to the supposed harshness of the terrain. Many consider this a waste of time, as the land is said to be unprofitable, with nothing more than dirt lying below.\n\nThe Darwiiz remain hopeful, calling it "An inquisition of the mind through the mapping of new lands."
 rinta_seeker_events.22.a: "Fund the expedition!"
 rinta_seeker_events.22.b: "Give them the lions share!"
 rinta_seeker_events.22.c: "More could be learned at home"

 rinta_seeker_events.40.t: "Halfling Beliefs"
 rinta_seeker_events.40.desc: "Halflings were some of the first foreign people to adopt the Rinta Seekers faith into their lives. Since then, they have flourished in their studies. Interestingly enough, the Vyzemby have begun mixing in their old faith with the Rinta Seekers beliefs. Many consider this to be unjust, while others are intrigued and see this as the Vyzemby way of studying knowledge. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is told that a decision is required to make sure these slight tensions do not bubble further."
 rinta_seeker_events.40.a: "Let them be"
 rinta_seeker_events.40.b: "They are misguided. Let us help them."
 rinta_seeker_events.40.c: "They must learn to adopt our ways of learning"

 rinta_seeker_events.41.t: "Visitors to the Court"
 rinta_seeker_events.41.desc: "While walking the palace grounds today, [Root.Monarch.GetName] came across three men sitting at a garden table, engrossed in a conversation over the value of their respective religions. The first tried to elucidate the virtues of High Philosophy, while another described the power of a living god in the form of the Khet, and the last explained the rightful guidance of the Transmutative Path. The trio weren’t exactly arguing, but each held steadfastly to their belief in the verity of following their own faith. [Root.Monarch.GetName] motioned for his advisors to stop and listen to how the conversation continued for several minutes before moving onward."
 rinta_seeker_events.41.a: "The order described by the High Philosophy seems most harmonious"
 rinta_seeker_events.41.b: "The Khetist presents a compelling case"
 rinta_seeker_events.41.c: "The follower of the Transmutative Path is surely not astray"
 rinta_seeker_events.41.d: "Our own faith encompasses all knowledge necessary for knowing the world"

 rinta_seeker_events.42.t: "A Dance Craze"
 rinta_seeker_events.42.desc: "Reports have reached our court of a group of Darwiiz in [event_province.GetName] that have begun dancing. This wouldn’t be out of the ordinary, were it not for the fact that the dance is especially eccentric, and has been going on for several full days at this point. Many local citizens have also become enthralled, joining the dance alongside the mystics. It has become a matter of some concern, and multiple have even fallen dead of exhaustion after their continued dancing."
 rinta_seeker_events.42.a: "Have the local guard detain the practitioners"
 rinta_seeker_events.42.b: "It is only right to let the dance continue"
 rinta_seeker_events.42.c: "We must witness this blessing in person!"

 rinta_seeker_events.43.t: "Hubris Of Knowledge"
 rinta_seeker_events.43.desc: "Recently, a talented advisor has come to prominence at court, and begun boasting about his accomplishments. This advisor claims to be the wisest in a variety of studies, and hopes to use these skills to provide to his people. Although many citizens find him to be an attractive governor who promises change, others see him as nothing more than an arrogant man with little to prove his claims. Often, those who suffer from arrogance and misconstrue the knowledge of the world are forced into exile, fined heavily, or even given physical punishment. Despite their hubris, this advisor seems to show latent talent for certain tasks in the court. Maybe their ego can be turned towards something more useful?"
 rinta_seeker_events.43.a: "Keep them around, they are too useful, flaws aside."
 rinta_seeker_events.43.b: "Enough is enough!"

 rinta_seeker_events.60.t: "Conflict On The Streets"
 rinta_seeker_events.60.desc: "In a country where Mwalim and Darwiiz are supposed to be in tandem, it is only natural that many of their opposing ideals would come into conflict. An undignified episode has made this clear in recent days, with Darwiiz and Mwalim breaking into sometimes near-physical arguments in the street over a current debate of unusual controversy. Many citizens have witnessed the unprofessionalism of the supposed greatest minds of the country, and are deeply disappointed. We must take action to make sure this doesn’t happen again."
 rinta_seeker_events.60.a: "Favor the Mwalim"
 rinta_seeker_events.60.b: "Pick No Sides"
 rinta_seeker_events.60.c: "Favor The Darwiiz"

 rinta_seeker_events.61.t: "Divided Scholars"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.desc: "It’s not often that circles of Mwalim feel the need to beseech a secular ruler for their opinion on a matter of religious practice, as they generally settle debates within their own scholarly associations. However, the resident community of Mwalim in our capital have come to a disagreement on proper religious practice that seems to be so intractable that they’ve sought the ruler’s opinion as the ultimate source of law within the realm. When raced to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the topic of debate is impossibly arcane and theoretical, leaving most of the court entirely perplexed. At the end of it all, both sides look to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] expectantly..."
 rinta_seeker_events.61.a: "They waste our time coming here with this nonsense!"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.b: "Pay for them to meet with other regional scholars to solve the debate"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.c: "Defer to your advisor on the topic"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.d: "Explain a profound reason as to why one side is correct"

 rinta_seeker_events.62.t: "Star Gazing"
 rinta_seeker_events.62.desc: "Late last night, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] found themselves gazing up at the stars, puzzling over the configuration of the sky’s constellations, when they were suddenly struck by the realization of a complex pattern hidden deep within the positions of the stars. They rushed to sketch a copy of the pattern so that they could more closely examine its meaning yet, after a night of frenzied study, could not decipher anything of note. To this, the court steward offered to summon a learned individual who would be able to provide an alternative perspective."
 rinta_seeker_events.62.a: "Bring me the most knowledgeable Mwalim from the nearest observatory"
 rinta_seeker_events.62.b: "Only a true mystic can discern the hidden truth of this observation"

 rinta_seeker_events.80.t: "Studies Afar"
 rinta_seeker_events.80.desc: "The faith of Rinta Seekers teaches its followers to seek knowledge. Our people have done so, but many look to pursue such even further. More and more of our young have decided to study abroad, in hopes of bringing back the knowledge they learn and passing it on. This leaves us without manpower, as able-bodied peoples travel away from our lands. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must take action to decide whether to stop this trend or to let it continue in hopes of good returns."
 rinta_seeker_events.80.a: "Let it be"
 rinta_seeker_events.80.b: "Restrict it to only those who are worthy may go."
 rinta_seeker_events.80.c: "Don’t Let Them Leave!"

 rinta_seeker_events.81.t: "Returning Students"
 rinta_seeker_events.81.desc: "Students of the Rinta Seekers faith are constantly seeking out knowledge, even if that means going out to study abroad. Recently, we’ve had a massive influx of students returning and bringing knowledge from across Sarhal and even further afield. One of the most notable of these is a young scholar who is coming back from studying in Tianlou. He brings with him many new ideas, some of which have intrigued even the greatest minds of our country.\n\nUnfortunately for us, these ideas come along with certain mystical aspects that many consider fraudulent and heretical. The scholar claims that this is just the nature of what he has learned, and there is proof of his ideas being correct. Many are divisive on whether to accept these teachings or to send him back to Haless to confer with other heretics."
 rinta_seeker_events.81.a: "Let him stay"
 rinta_seeker_events.81.b: "Kick him out!"
 rinta_seeker_events.81.c: "Keep him, but make sure he doesn’t say anything too crazy"

 rinta_seeker_events.82.t: "A Puzzling Discovery"
 rinta_seeker_events.82.desc: "Today, a herald brought news to the court of the findings of an expedition within lizardfolk territory. While delving deep within a lizardfolk temple, they happened upon a glyph that exactly resembled one of the most sacred of geometries, the 8-segmented circle surrounded by inward facing triangles. The work is so distinctly in a Baashidi style that it seems like it could not possibly have been made by any other group, yet it bears the same level of wear as the surrounding ancient glyphs. The finding has mystified scholars at home, with some claiming it as a sign of the timeless truth of our teachings. Regardless, they have taken to searching for any logical explanation as to the glyph’s existence."
 rinta_seeker_events.82.a: "Logic is unnecessary, it is enough to meditate on another what is merely another emanation of truth"
 rinta_seeker_events.82.b: "This geometry has a very particular meaning, if we outfit a team to study the surrounding glyphs, they will likely show that the glyph was used to express a similar concept."
 rinta_seeker_events.82.c: "Have some members of our court lead an inquiry; if we delve further into the geometry itself, the underlying connection will surely be revealed"

 rinta_seeker_events.100.t: "Government Sponsored Studies"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.desc: "Recently, a famous organization of Mwalim from a college have asked for government funding in a study that they are doing. They state that they seek to use the money to delve into new experiments and ideas through the expansion of the school. Many Mwalim have shown support for this idea, despite its price. What should we do?"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.a: "Give them a generous donation"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.b: "Give them a small donation"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.c: "We’re spending too much money!"

 rinta_seeker_events.101.t: "Knowledgeable Leaders"
 rinta_seeker_events.101.desc: "Leaders amongst the Baashidi have often proven themselves some of the most knowledgeable in the world. Unfortunately for [Root.Monarch.GetName], people have begun to doubt [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] knowledge. A group of Mwalim have appeared to [Root.Monarch.GetName] in court, antagonizing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. This is obviously heresy of the highest degree, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] fears that if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] rids them from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] presence, then it will confirm their beliefs. What should [Root.Monarch.GetName] do?"
 rinta_seeker_events.101.a: "Maybe a "donation" would keep them quiet?"
 rinta_seeker_events.101.b: "I may not be the wisest, but I am always willing to learn."

 rinta_seeker_events.102.t: "Time To Study"
 rinta_seeker_events.102.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is often considered a fairly studious ruler. He has taken interest in many different subjects. Unfortunately for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], the obligations of rulership provide strain to the amount of time a ruler has available. It has noticeably taken a toll on [Root.Monarch.GetName], who seems to be longing to delve into a new study.\n\nThis has been coming to a head recently - with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] obligations taking up the entirety of the day, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been assigning more of them to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors. Close friends of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have seen [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] reading literature, while [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors have poorly managed the country, and have even taken bribes to enact things without [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s permission! What should be done?"
 rinta_seeker_events.102.a: "We need a leader, not a reader."
 rinta_seeker_events.102.b: "Moderation is key."
 rinta_seeker_events.102.c: "Let [Root.Monarch.GetName] do what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wants"

 rinta_seeker_events.103.t: "Stagnation in the Abodes of Knowledge"
 rinta_seeker_events.103.desc: "Much of our scholarly society is organized into technical and academic associations, and local guilds of architects, astronomers, mathematicians and the like can be found in cities throughout the realm. These guilds are headed by bodies of their most learned individuals, who have studied and practiced for decades before holding their positions. Yet advancement in the guilds can often be as determined by one’s social aptitude as their intellectual capability, and a whole generation of journeymen scholars are beginning to call for systemic reform, lest they secede from the guilds and threaten their continued growth. These younger academics claim their aged counterparts are no longer dynamic in the methods by which they seek to rationalize the nature of Halann, and have become stagnant in their search for knowledge. They themselves claim to represent a new intellectual dynamism that can bring new life to the dying guilds, if only their skill could be properly recognized. As tensions rise, members of both sides appeal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to support their goals."
 rinta_seeker_events.103.a: "These youth do not realize that to understand Halann requires a depth of study and patience."
 rinta_seeker_events.103.b: "To truly progress our study it must be necessary to occasionally reorganize."

 incident_rinta_dark_magic_title: "Dark Magicks"
 incident_rinta_dark_magic_desc: "The gaping ‘Hellhole’ in Ardimya is renowned for releasing the scourge of Qeyikul upon the continent for the last millennia. Many have tried to put a stop to it, only to end up as food for the monsters. Recently though, the re-discovery of the Viscus of the Desert and the Nail of the Damned has given a rise in hope for Ardimya to be saved.\n\nThere is just one issue: Doing so requires heavy knowledge in the same infernal magic that brought the hole here in the first place. Now, our shamans and mages will have to use their wits and balance the precarious acts of wielding dark magicks and stopping the spread of its after effects, to finally put an end to the infernal menace."

 #Events for Dark Magicks
 rinta_seeker_events.200.t: "Hidden"
 rinta_seeker_events.200.desc: "Dont look"
 rinta_seeker_events.200.a: "Noooo"

 rinta_seeker_events.201.t: "Rediscovery of the Viscus"
 rinta_seeker_events.201.desc: "More than a thousand years ago, Almadhab the Gold and Alahmar the Red rebelled against their mother, Ardimya the Great. The two half-breeds knew they couldn’t withstand the unlimited strength of a full genie, that they would be crushed for their simple inability to be born full blood. This was the price of having a human father, after all. \n\nThus, to even the playing field, they decided to look deep into the dark arts: Necromancy of proportions inconceivable. They tainted the desert dunes red with sacrifices to the occult for a great period, all in hopes that they could forge a weapon great enough to destroy that which they despised.\n\nUltimately, they succeeded in creating the Viscus of the Desert: a hammer and nail imbued with an energy so profoundly inimical to life that merely striking hammer on nail into the surface of the earth broke the boundaries between hell and earth. What they failed in was the wielding: they were plunged immediately into this fissure of their own creation, banished from our realm. While Ardimya managed to contain the breach of reality at the time, when she dissipated it was left to fester. Qeyikul soon came to ravage Ardimya, trading homes and lives for blood and gore. \n\nToday, we may just be able to fix the kin’s mistake, by doing what they could not. We will study the tools they made and learn how to use them properly. These magicks are nothing to be trifled with, marred with impurity and hatred for the living, but they can be harnessed. We will close the breach for good, and save the Jasiir Doog."
 rinta_seeker_events.201.a: "We will save Ardimya."

 rinta_seeker_events.202.t: "The Return of The Magi Conference"
 rinta_seeker_events.202.desc: "Brooding conversations and murmurs of confusion echoed through the grand halls of the Kaniisad in Qasri Aqoon. Mwalim and Darwiiz wondered why they had been summoned, promised ‘a revelation’.\n\nTheir qualms were sullied as soon as the Great Mwalim Yableh unsheathed the Viscus, whisking into reality a power so deep, so profound that its presence brought shudders to even the most wise of Magi. \n\nTopics of conversation immediately shifted towards one idea: Can we now close the damned pit in the middle of the Jasir Doog? Can we save Ardimya? \n\n“We do not know how we can, or IF we can… but if there wasn’t a chance to do right by our ancestors, then I wouldn’t have summoned you here. If we overcome bitter rivalries and petty disagreements, we can restore the Jasiir Doog to its former glory. We will be rid of the Qeyikul.”\n\nCheers over prospects of glory and the end of evil erupted within the hall. People would be saved. People would be free."
 rinta_seeker_events.202.a: "Now, let’s get started."
 rinta_seeker_events.202_tt: "A new mage every day will have the prospect of wielding the relic. As they study the relic, make sure to manage your use of it. If you cannot show restraint, expect dire consequences."

 rinta_seeker_events.203.t: "To Store Evil"
 rinta_seeker_events.203.desc: "Containment of a relic as powerful as the Viscus of the Desert has felt increasingly impossible. Its effects on the environment and people around it have proven… negative… to say the least. The Magi Conference has floated multiple solutions within the past year to attempt to figure out how to keep the Viscus’ effects from spreading.\n\nAll of them have proven futile. Only one of the few proposed solutions left has caught the eye of many of the remaining magi still willing to pursue the storage of the relic:\n\n“A giant counterspell.” \n\nThe Great Mwalim attending all furrowed their brows at the words of the young Darwiiz Angad. Doubt spread throughout the room at first, but some considered the idea, and ultimately came to agree: This was most likely the best solution. The opposition claimed that it would ruin the environment it was stored in, just as in Kafwah, just as in Mashan, just as in Daroor. Angad spoke again:\n\n“Nobody can truly know what will happen until the spell falls, and even then, we can have as much time to prepare as we need for that. Hold it in a box, above the sands, and have the spell be maintained until we must transport it again.”"
 rinta_seeker_events.203.a: "Seal It"
 rinta_seeker_events.203.b: "Let's hold off on it, for now."

 rinta_seeker_events.204.t: "The End To The Relic"
 rinta_seeker_events.204.desc: "Ten years ago, demons scorched the lands of the ancient empires of Ardimya. A land destroyed out of spite. An ugly war with consequences borne by uninvolved descendants. What kind of a foolish tale is that?\n\nSomebody has to write its end.\n\nAs the end draws to a close, and the dark magicks have been completely studied, the coalition of mages feels ready to end the nightmare, and save Ardimya. \n\nThe caravans walk…\n\nwalk…\n\nDays end… slaughter bells and tolls.\n\nwalk…\n\nDays begin… slaughter bells and tolls.\n\nAfter so much sacrifice, the end of many a demon, the loss of many of our friends, the mages begin their ritual…"
 rinta_seeker_events.204.a: "What comes next will change fate."

 rinta_seeker_events.205.t: "Ardimya Saved"
 rinta_seeker_events.205.desc: "“What do you think?” The Mwalim Sana asks a Wattoi mother.\n\n“As a woman yourself, I think you’ll understand it best if I put it like this: I wouldn’t have lived a year longer. I wouldn’t have been able to care for my children. I would have been able to grow old and watch my family. I don’t know how to fight. I know how to scavenge, sure… but those demons have… HAD… a strong life sense. They knew you were there. They knew where you weren’t. Scavenging doesn’t mean anything if you can’t fight. Those who could barely live longer than I.”\n\nShe turned to her husband, “How old am I?”\n\n“I think you’ve been here since somber Jalaal died.”\n\n“Twenty-six years then. Can you imagine that?” She turns to Sana. “I was preparing for my funeral, or whatever would happen when I died. I now have to deal with discovering what it means to grow old.”\n\nThe woman gives a genuine smile. A tear rolls down her cheek.\n\n“Thank you. Thank you a hundred, no, a thousand times over. I’m sure everybody here will tell you the same. You people have saved our lands. Your generosity will never be forgotten.”\n\nShe taps to the temple of her head.\n\n“We remember. We kept our traditions and cultures alive despite all of what happened. We will remember. We will.”\n\nSana smiles…"
 rinta_seeker_events.205.a: "We live to serve."

 rinta_seeker_events.206.t: "Almadhab’s Return"
 rinta_seeker_events.206.desc: "A farce is what it all is. Hope was a lie. The relic’s magic and wisdom was a misguided truth. Ultimately, it all came back to bite the Magi Council.\n\nWhat we learned, or what we DID, depending on what a few Wattoi described, was a ritual: not to close the hole, but to resurrect someone out of it.\n\nThey spoke as if they were sinners who had seen god face to face:\n\n“He smelled of sulfur, a gaping hole in his chest.”\n\n“What were they thinking… they promised us better…”\n\nA man shook in the corner; a woman cried out, her face singed:\n\n“He spoke in a tone I can’t even describe. How do you threaten someone with such a soothing voice?”\n\nThe clan leader of the Wattoi was staring off into the distance intensively. He too had abandoned camp, leaving someone else to rule the remainder of the Wattoi. \n\n“He has returned, and he told me to tell the leaders of the world: Submit, or face execution.”\n\nBrutally simple, brutally honest, brutally true. \n\nIn the end, Almadhab would most likely have it too."

 rinta_seeker_events.211.desc: "Almadhab has been staved off, with his Psychopomps vanquished through swords and magics. The once gaping infernal pit was sealed in a gigantic burst of life, leaving nothing behind but azure steam and a fading memory of a continent drenched in blood. \n\nFamilies return to their ancestral lands, tribes leave their weapons behind, children run out to graze the open fields, for the first time in many a century.\n\nThere are no tears, not even a sign of sorrow. \n\nFor the Ardimyans, all they want to do is smile. Enjoy a world clean of death. Cherish a life liberated from eternal pain. Bring those who died with them into a better future, hoping that they can see it from above.\n\nAlmadhab himself has disappeared into nothingness, not a trace of his legacy anywhere."
 rinta_seeker_events.211.a: "The dawn of the greatest day!"

 rinta_seeker_events.212.t: "The Plan Of Almadhab"
 rinta_seeker_events.212.desc: "The purpose of this conquest is to spread the infernal across the whole world. Intertwining the planes with one another: that sort of energy overlap will allow me to reset this world completely using magic. It's simple. \n\nOnce we are done here, the negative energy made will be cast back into the infernal, and the balance between planes will be restored. \n\nThere will be three outcomes to this mission:\n\nOne, society starts straight from the beginning. Humans will have no memory of the previous world.\n\nTwo: The complete erasure of immortality from all planes of existence. \n\nIt will be beautiful to watch the sun rise on a world where nobody has to be afraid of eternal greed. Without the threat of a god-king with a taste for conquest, or conniving genies wanting to play with lives for kicks. It will be beautiful to know that everything you touch and see, will eventually change into something else. \n\nEverything will be finite.\n\nI think that will be a pure world.\n\nDo you agree, darling Meja?"

Recently though, in our rush to find a solution to the problem of the gaping hole in Ardimya, certain mages have begun to feel that the environment around them has become resonant with an intoxicating vibrance.\n\nTo many, it has become clear that the wickedness of the Viscus has begun to spread around like a poisonous gas. The mages who currently wield the tool believe that they are close to an important discovery and wish to continue on with their testing despite the risks. Many Mwalim and Darwiiz both fear the worst outcome, and are begging that the Viscus be relocated."

 rinta_seeker_events.251.desc: "The Viscus Of The Damned is currently being tested by a few mages outside of any major population area. After a variety of tests and gimmicks, they desire to test the specific abilities of both the Hammer and the Nail. They have asked for permission to separate the tools for an extended period of time to run solo tests\n\nThey claim that this would allow for double the amount of testing, as each part of the relic could be deeply analyzed. \n\nOthers amongst the council claim that this conservative form of testing will have no effect; the hammer without the nail is non-functional. They don’t have an effect without each other. The closer they come, the more potent their magic is. When they touch, their resonance completes.\n\nHow should we rule?"
 rinta_seeker_events.251.a: "Yes"

 rinta_seeker_events.252.t: "Repeating a Sliver Of Magic"
 rinta_seeker_events.252.desc: "Some Darwiiz have come to the Council of Magi to discuss the possibility of replicating possible conditions surrounding the creation of the Viscus. Many a magi seem to be perplexed as to how this could occur, before a Darwiiz speaks:\n\n“Our voyages across the lands have allowed us a little bit more of an eye as to what happened two thousand years ago. From the tablets and scrolls we collected, it seems the ritual is replicable to a certain degree. With this information, we could try to make and unmake something with the same magicks as Almadhab. It may only be a part, and we may have to come back many times over, but it is one of our best options.”\n\nMurmurs disappear as the crowd slowly moved towards agreement, until another Darwiiz alongside the first speaks.\n\n“We should remind you though, these are Dark Magicks. It is difficult to be sure what effects could ensue if we try to do this. I believe wholeheartedly though that if we have the backing of a few magi to help us contain the damage, if anything even does happen to go wrong… then these experiments could teach us how to undo the void in Ardimya.” \n\nDebate sings out in the hall, but ultimately, the last voice to speak is you.\n\nAs you open your mouth, a few words echo throughout the hall."
 rinta_seeker_events.252.a: "Go ahead."
 rinta_seeker_events.252.b: "Just reverse engineer another similar relic."

 rinta_seeker_events.253.desc: "After weeks of studying the process of creating relics with the same dark magicks as Almadhab and Alahmar, the results were presented to the court of mages:\n\n“We have successfully made a tool able to summon dark beasts from the shadow plane. It’s not as powerful as the Viscus, but it is something…”\n\n“It *was* something. We unmade it as well.”\n\nThe crowd of mages cheers. A great battle won in the war against the infernal. Saving Ardimya feels closer than ever before."
 rinta_seeker_events.253.a: "Let's continue then!"

 rinta_seeker_events.254.t: "Failure In Magicks"
 rinta_seeker_events.254.desc: "The Darwiiz who set out to learn how to make and unmake the evil of the Viscus have not returned. All we have heard is of the tragic tale in the far off hills of an unknown location, the details changing every day. \n\nSome mystical explosion here, or there, always ending with “nothing left.”\n\nIf the Darwiiz had been less stingy about not letting their path be followed, then maybe we could have saved them. Unfortunately, they stuck to their ideology through thick and thin. \n\n“We have lost great mages today for some stupid experiment. From now on, let us be more careful when approaching Dark Magicks… please? Remember that they can’t be negotiated with, but they can be tempted by our unknowing.”"
 rinta_seeker_events.254.a: "We pray for this to never happen again."

 rinta_seeker_events.255.t: "Progress in Dark Magicks"
 rinta_seeker_events.255.desc: "“As we study in the field of all that is hated of the mystical, we have learned much. The courts of all nations under the Rinta Seekers faith have assisted the Magi Council greatly in pursuing their goals. I, [Root.Monarch.Getname] have devoted much time to learning about the whatshappenings of mages and their works. Hopefully other rulers can show a similar level of devotion to bring an end to this threat. There will be no more demons in our fatherlands!”\n\nThe Magi Council grows excited from [Root.Monarch.Getname]’s speech. They back down from the central podium, and by sundown are already making preparations to leave Qasri Aqoon.\n\n[Root.Monarch.Getname] turns to his most trusted advisor and begins to speak:\n\n“Akooson?”\n\n“Yes my lord?”"

 rinta_seeker_events.256.desc: "Our efforts to right the wrong done by Almadhab many years ago have garnered some global attention. A trickle of international voyagers have come to the Jasiir Jadid, seeking our council. Upon their entry into our halls, they asked if they could be of assistance to the project. Mages from Cannor, Haless, and even the Forbidden Plains have brought trinkets and artifacts rumored to have power great enough to stop the overflow of the infernal into the prime material.\n\nThe Magi Council bursts into discussion…\n\n“They can help us!”\n\n“They will taint our work, it’ll take them too long to adjust!”\n\n“We can teach them!”\n\n“They won’t know…”\n\nOn and on and on…\n\nUntil ultimately, a decision is made."

 rinta_seeker_events.257.desc: "A ruin in [rinta_ruin_found.GetName] has been found to contain a scroll talking of Almadhab and Alahmar’s magical potential. As half genies, they were already extremely potent in their ability to make wishes. As mages, this power was further enhanced to heights unreachable by even the most exceptional conventional mages; the gap between them and us was almost as monumental as the distance between the ends of the earth. Each scroll that they have left behind provides the Mage Council a fraction of their power; each brings us one step closer to ending this madness.\n\n[rinta_ruin_found.GetName] has been wary of allowing outside entities from entering their country for this, but with a little convincing, the Magi Council is sure that they can be tempted to allow for us to investigate the ruins. What is more worrying is the prospect that the buildup of this scroll’s innate resonance with the Dark Magicks might affect the surrounding environment. Only time will tell what the effects of desecrating this ruin can bring."

 rinta_seeker_events.258.desc: "Dark magicks are inherently chaotic. They ebb and flow in jagged lines, leaving marks wherever their presence is felt. Current work done by the Magi Council in studying the Viscus has resulted in marks appearing to the general population: vast spires of obsidian, ritualistic statues of beasts, corn fields of every color, impossible mountain shapes churning into form.\n\nDark magicks are as chaotic as can be. We can only pray that the effects may bless us with something… or at the very least not hurt us."
 rinta_seeker_events.258.a: "What is it this time…"

 rinta_seeker_events.259.t: "Cleansing the Evil"
 rinta_seeker_events.259.desc: "With all the testing being done, it is only to be expected that the dark magicks leave behind an evil presence wherever they are used. We try to mitigate its effects as much as we can, but the Magi Council can only do so much in the face of the raw wrath of the devious and blighted. \n\nOver time though, we can prevail. The efforts of many a mage have allowed for [rinta_tarrem1.GetCapitalName] to be cleansed of its ill effects. Hopefully, for the other areas inflicted with this illness, we can remove the presence of the infernal soon."
 rinta_seeker_events.259.a: "Blessed be the wicked healed by our hand."

 rinta_seeker_events.260.desc: "Recent experiments in [rinta_tarrem1.GetCapitalName] have resulted in surrounding towns being affected by the presence of the infernal. People have gone mad, either seeing demons or hearing voices. Nobody wishes to leave their homes, believing it to be the gods returning. The Council of Magi, worried of the chaos such infernal breakthrough could bring if it becomes widespread, debates amongst itself as to what it should do. Five hundred mages each give their own proposals, bickering over whether this can be handled at all, or if it is even worth their time.\nA Magi from [rinta_tarrem1.GetCapitalName] speaks out:\n“My people are afraid. Afraid of what? We can’t allow this to spread because of our devotion to ending the Viscus and Infernal. We are losing sight of the main purpose: to end the suffering of people. We can’t just exchange one suffering for another! We can’t let more innocent people bear the burden!"

 rinta_seeker_events.305.desc: "The Adeen, the state-owned slave soldiers of the Baashidi who serve as the artillerists and marines of their armies, have grown in influence as the militaries of the Baashidi states have begun to modernize. They have reached a level of influence where they are reflecting on their place as a significant group within Baashidi society, and it falls upon the state to mediate this transition. A tumultuous period is in store for the Baashidi, as for a faction as militarized as the Adeen, such a negotiation is sure to be violent."
 rinta_seeker_events.305.a: "They will find their place or be forced into it."

 rinta_seeker_events.306.t: "Adeeni Magi"
 rinta_seeker_events.306.desc: "Adeen with magical ability are an irregularity, and there is no established precedent on how they should be handled. Under the status quo, magically gifted Adeen remain as property of the state, and the usage of their magic is handled on a case by case basis. Their abilities are generally only put to use in warfare, and any Adeeni mage who appears threateningly powerful is swiftly dealt with. Maintaining this stance, however, would only raise tensions with the Adeen, especially any potentially powerful mages hidden among their ranks, while at the same time alienating our Mage guilds, who covet this source of potential talent. Alternatively, their ownership could be transferred directly to the guilds, giving them more power and placating them, but once again angering the Adeen. Finally, these gifted Adeen could be manumitted outright, so as to freely choose their paths as enlightened individuals."
 rinta_seeker_events.306.a: "These magically attuned Adeen are still the servants of the state."
 rinta_seeker_events.306.b: "They are under the purview of the House of Exorcism."
 rinta_seeker_events.306.c: "They should be free to use their abilities in search of truth."

 rinta_seeker_events.307.t: "Adeeni Faith"
 rinta_seeker_events.307.desc: "There is no standard religious outlook among the Adeen, with some of their internal factions taking a much narrower or wider View of Knowledge than society at large, and many among their ranks still practice elements of their native beliefs. Both our Mwalim and Darwiiz are interested in guiding the Adeen towards enlightenment through knowledge, and members of both groups have established study circles, ritual groups, and strong personal followings among different factions of the Adeen. Yet now open conflict has broken out within the Adeen over the matter, seriously diminishing their use as a unified fighting force. The Adeen generally believe they have the right to sort out the matter among themselves, but influential Mwalim believe the state should intervene on their behalf, while their Darwiiz counterparts oppose a restriction on the individual’s right to seek truth for themselves - whether they are Adeen or not. They instead claim that if we allow them to freely proselytize among the Adeen, the soldiers will become zealous warriors inspired by their faith."
 rinta_seeker_events.307.a: "Leave the matter to the Adeen themselves."
 rinta_seeker_events.307.b: "Enforce unity of outlook."
 rinta_seeker_events.307.c: "Sanction Darwiiz activities."

 rinta_seeker_events.308.t: "Adeeni Wealth"
 rinta_seeker_events.308.desc: "In many cases, Adeen have been able to leverage their skills to engage in some sort of economic activity when not on active duty. While their employment is generally small-scale, like as sales clerks or minor traders, some Adeen have managed to amass significant wealth.These wealthy Adeen prefer to hire from within their own ranks, especially those who share their ancestry, a practice which has caused our Baashidi merchants to grow increasingly restive. They claim that slaves should not even be able to hold such personal wealth, and that the Adeen’s ability to do so hurts their traditional positions within our markets. Some have even claimed that wealthy Adeen have used their fellow employees as armed enforcers to violently impede the activity of free merchants."
 rinta_seeker_events.308.a: "Confiscate Adeeni wealth and shut down their businesses!"
 rinta_seeker_events.308.b: "Restrict Adeen from hiring other Adeen, but allow them to continue operating."

 rinta_seeker_events.309.t: "Adeeni Land"
 rinta_seeker_events.309.desc: "Traditionally, if Adeen have been allowed any land at all it has been in the form of Halqa, autonomous communal gatherings on land controlled by their owner, the crown. Veteran Adeen, reaching the end of their suitability for active military service, have submitted a petition to the crown that they be granted land once reaching an advanced point in their career, so that they may prepare themselves and their families for their retirement from service. Our nobility have immediately and forcibly opposed such a system, claiming it would establish a new hereditary class of landowners that would totally upend the traditional hierarchy."
 rinta_seeker_events.309.a: "Decline, but set aside additional funds for the Adeen’s retirement."
 rinta_seeker_events.309.b: "Agree, but only for non-hereditary temporary land grants."

 rinta_seeker_events.310.t: "Adeen Demand Autonomy in Bada Bilad"
 rinta_seeker_events.310.desc: "Despite defining a clearer policy regarding the Adeen in our country, tensions amongst themselves and between them and other social classes of our realm continue to flare up into heated conflict. It seems that everyday new quarrels are brought to court for adjudication: land disputes, business disagreements, religious controversy, and simple violent altercations. A leading faction within the Adeen has brought to the $MONARCHTITLE$ a radical solution: grant our Adeen a measure of self-governance on the island of Bada Bilad. They promise to continue serving loyally in our armies, and be forever grateful for the opportunity to administer themselves under our benevolent rule. Other advisors are quick to object however, claiming the Adeen should instead be bound more tightly to the firm hand of the state, and that granting them any measure of autonomy would inevitably upend their long standing tradition of servitude. The Adeen are resolute, stating that their compromise offer is final, and if declined, our Adeen may rise up as a whole against us."
 rinta_seeker_events.310.a: "Grant them this boon, it will ease tensions and ensure their future loyalty."
 rinta_seeker_events.310.b: "Decline the Adeeni offer, they are slaves and will remain slaves."

They have rebelled against their former masters, seeking to establish their own free society on the island of Bada Bilad. Aiding their cause would certainly avail us of our own troubles with our Adeen, and their emissaries have promised to ensure the future loyalty of our Adeen should they be victorious."
 rinta_seeker_events.311.a: "We shall aid them in their revolt."

 rinta_seeker_events.312.desc: "Rarely do rebellions avoid failure. Even rarer still do they ensure positive, lasting change for those in whose name they are started. But today the Adeen of Maakhibkhii stand proud and victorious, having at long last regained some measure of control over their own destiny. Their kin still held in bondage across the Baashidi states may not enjoy the same freedom as they do now, but their island realm will become a shining beacon for all Adeen, providing a glimpse into a brighter future. It is certainly true that the present wave of Adeeni unrest has subsided with the secession of Maakhibkhii, and a sense of normalcy has returned to Baashidi society, at least for now."
 rinta_seeker_events.312.a: "Let us now write our own story."
 rinta_seeker_events.312.b: "Our Adeen will be grateful for the role we played."
 rinta_seeker_events.312.c: "Those insolent slaves will know their place once more, but not yet."
 rinta_seeker_events.312.d: "An interesting conclusion to this tumultuous chapter."

 rinta_seeker_events.313.t: "An End to the Adeen Crisis"
 rinta_seeker_events.313.desc: "A pen is put to paper, hands are shook, pronouncements made. With that, the futures of countless lives are relegated back to ignominious degradation. A future where these slave-warriors could live with at least a modicum of freedom was briefly glimpsed, but it has faded into obscurity with the failure of Maakhibkhii’s secession. Those Adeen who led the rebellion, if not killed in the fighting, have been made examples of, so that their compatriots will never forget their proper place again. With the collapse of Maakhibkhii, the wave of Adeeni unrest which overtook Baashidi society has also ended, its last ounces of energy spent in the fervent death throes of an impossible dream."
 rinta_seeker_events.313.a: "Alas, our efforts to stoke their flame were for naught."
 rinta_seeker_events.313.b: "Finally, we can put an end to this sordid chapter of chaos."
 rinta_seeker_events.313.c: "Our own Adeen now know better than to emulate their cousins."

 rinta_seeker_events.315.t: "Heavenly Spiral Eye"
 rinta_seeker_events.315.desc: "The Ilmada are the most powerful eyes in history, said to have been a gift directly from genies to human clans for their service unto their domains. Ilmada itself means “Honor Eye,” with its occurrence being so rare that their wearers are recorded with an almost godlike reverence within history.\n The last known wielder of an Ilmada was Nasiiye, a great mage with eyes of a deep purple hue, spiraling into yellow pupils. With those eyes he saw the past, present, and future. He foretold better days if only people were to follow his gaze. Those who chose to join him were called his Abshirites. The common folk saw him as a hero of destiny, carrying the banner of the poor and wealthy alike. Only the hidebound minds of the scholars in Baddabi spoke against his word, and eventually dramatically escalated the simmering tensions by having him executed on his pilgrimage to the city of Qasri Aqoon. His eyes were lost that day, rumoured to be kept by the kings of Baddabi as a treasure of a hollow triumph.\n The Abshirites eventually found themselves subdued as slaves, punished for spreading their word of peace to sullied ears deaf to their message, all in the hope that they may yet achieve tranquility in their time. Out of these enslaved Abshirites, the Adeen coalesced, with elders secretly teaching newcomers to their ranks the increasingly distorted Abshirite doctrine and ultimate goal: A truly equal society coming together in Bada Bilad, with all flowing together towards tranquility.\n Fate’s dire hand weaves a great reckoning, a perfect storm. Nasiiye may have foreseen all of this, or maybe it was truly just the inevitable consequence of mortal greed and cruelty.\n In the end, does it matter where he was from, or who he was born from? These things never seemed to matter to the crowds he spoke to. Maybe this upheaval is where all things have led to.\n For finally, a new prophet is born unto us. Blessed with those sacred spiral eyes, yellow pupils in the center, ever falling down into singularity.\nHe will save the poor, and save the wealthy. Nonetheless, tranquility will come at a steep price for all; but in the end, it will all be worth it.\n He has seen the past, present, and the future - our course is clear.\n “Isha… you may call me Isha. That is the name given to me by my captors. In time, it will become the name of salvation.”"
 rinta_seeker_events.315.a: "“It's in those eyes… I know it.”"

 rinta_seeker_events.351.t: "Factional Skirmish"
 rinta_seeker_events.351.desc: "While the Adeen are united in their desire for greater recognition within society, many within their diverse ranks are divided over how to achieve this goal. Some take a more hardline stance while others believe in gradual pragmatism, and some only advocate for their ethnic group at the expense of all others. These multifarious motivations often lead to conflict, and conflict within a professionalized fighting force often turns violent. Skirmishes between two competing factions have turned violent in $PROVINCE$, requiring an official response."
 rinta_seeker_events.351.a: "Send in the regulars to reestablish order."
 rinta_seeker_events.351.b: "Let each side tire themselves out."

 rinta_seeker_events.352.t: "Officer Assassinated"
 rinta_seeker_events.352.desc: "Radical Adeen appear to have assassinated a noble officer from the House of Might, asserting their own prominence in military affairs, and infuriating our nobility. They call for a thorough investigation into the matter, to find the killer and bring them to justice, or at the very least make an example of someone to discipline the unruly slave soldiers. Doing so would definitely anger the Adeen, but letting the matter drop would only further incense our nobles."
 rinta_seeker_events.352.a: "Conduct a ruthless investigation and enforce discipline."
 rinta_seeker_events.352.b: "Avoid stirring the pot, the nobility will have to get over it, eventually."

 rinta_seeker_events.353.t: "Refusal to Train"
 rinta_seeker_events.353.desc: "Reports from our barracks and forts have reached the court speaking of a unit of Adeen flat-out refusing to train or perform their duties, while posing demands to be treated with the dignity afforded regular soldiers. Local officers have found themselves helpless to end this nonsense, with the mutineers remaining steadfast in the face of normal punishment. They look to the crown for direction, lest the situation turn into a full-blown revolt."
 rinta_seeker_events.353.a: "Execute the ringleaders, and whip their followers back into shape."
 rinta_seeker_events.353.b: "Accept some minor demands, and reshuffle assignments to break up the group."

 rinta_seeker_events.354.t: "Local Secession"
 rinta_seeker_events.354.desc: "A small group of Adeen have withdrawn to their Halqa, outright refusing to recognize any sovereignty or outside authority over their own. Such a practice is generally reserved for protests in grave matters of disrespect, such as an owner’s murder of one of their group. In this case however, they claim to be responding to transgressions committed against the entirety of the Adeen, and the persistent lack of autonomy in spite of their loyal service. They demand a recognition of their justified demands and a status appropriate for their influence. We can try to ignore this group, hoping their act stays isolated, or nip it in the bud before their action spreads."
 rinta_seeker_events.354.a: "Storm the settlement and burn it down."
 rinta_seeker_events.354.b: "Permit this while tensions are high."

 rinta_seeker_events.355.t: "Hardliners Take Up Arms"
 rinta_seeker_events.355.desc: "A group of incensed Adeen have taken their demands for recognition and respect as a vital part of Baashidi society to the street, taking up arms and declaring revolt against our ruler’s authority!"
 rinta_seeker_events.355.a: "This cannot be allowed to spread. Put down these radicals at once!"
