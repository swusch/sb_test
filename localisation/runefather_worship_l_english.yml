 runefather_worship.1.t:0 "Choose Your Allegiance"
 runefather_worship.1.d:0 "Our years of loyalty to our chosen benefactor have been long and arduous, but we must decide if they were fruitful enough. Advisors scramble in the court, arguing for their choice of allegiance to suit their own goals, but the final choice lies with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nWill we continue our support for our original choice or risk their anger by betraying them and choosing another to show our loyalty to."

 runefather_worship.11.t:0 "Shadowhammer Clan Rally"
 runefather_worship.11.d:0 "The supporters of the Shadowhammer Clan have recently held a rally in our capital to support the conquest of the Serpentspine. Their calls for righteous vengeance and devotion to the Runefather has driven thousands of his most faithful to take up arms, while those on the domestic front have found a renewed sense of pride and purpose."
 runefather_worship.11.a:0 "Prodrî!"
 runefather_worship.11.b:0 "Let us invest further."

 runefather_worship.12.t:0 "Shadowhammer Fanatic Requests Generalship"
 runefather_worship.12.d:0 "A young and upcoming supporter of the Shadowhammer Clan has shown promise on the battlefield and they are now requesting to lead an army so that they may exact vengeance for the Runefather on the surface. While the majority of the army approves of such a promotion, the Fûrdanhund have objected to it, stating that while the Dwarf shows prowess as a fighter, they lack any true leadership experience and will only hinder the chain of command."
 runefather_worship.12.a:0 "Their services will be useful."
 runefather_worship.12.b:0 "Let us listen to the real generals."

 runefather_worship.13.t:0 "Shadowhammer Bureaucrats"
 runefather_worship.13.d:0 "With their influence growing ever growing and spurred on by our recent successes, the Shadowhammer Clan has begun providing further support for our administration in managing the newly conquered lands of the Dwarovar. A supply of fresh runes and young bureaucrats looking to make a name for themselves have arrived from the Serpentdepths to help with the cleansing of the traitors’ symbols, and their meticulous investigations into every dark corner of our realm has resulted in a more efficient integration."
 runefather_worship.13.a:0 "Splendid."

 runefather_worship.14.t:0 "Shadowhammer Overextension"
 runefather_worship.14.d:0 "The fanaticism of the Shadowhammer Clan, while necessary to carry out the Runefather’s will, has resulted in the clan overextending themselves, with a corresponding slowdown in our administrative capacities. While many point fingers at the Shadowhammer for this mistake, the Shadowhammer Clan themselves claim that they are only doing what is absolutely necessary to ensure our domination of the Dwarovar."
 runefather_worship.14.a:0 "What a mess..."
 runefather_worship.14.b:0 "Some crowns might fix this."

 runefather_worship.15.t:0 "Obsidian Conquest and Riches"
 runefather_worship.15.d:0 "After over 7000 years in exile in the Serpentdepths, we have finally returned to the Dwarovar. In the depths below, the constant conflict between the Shadowhammer and Darkstone Clans over the empire's future had long echoed throughout the halls of Hargûn Ruzazir. Yet as time went on, both sides learned that they could exploit the growing power of the other. While the Shadowhammer Clan advocates for the conquest of the Serpentspine, the Darkstone Clan turns the caverns they leave behind into an engine for the war machines. The traitors and savages shall tremble before the full might of our armies."
 runefather_worship.15.a:0 "A Healthy compromise."

 runefather_worship.21.t:0 "Steel from the Serpentdepths"
 runefather_worship.21.d:0 "With the flow of raw materials from our conquests back into the Serpentdepths, a surplus of durable alloys and other metals have entered into Clan Darkstone’s immense production chains, and have bolstered the quality of our manufacturing. This influx will no doubt allow easier armament and maintenance of our troops."
 runefather_worship.21.a:0 "They shall fear our steel."
 runefather_worship.21.b:0 "Buy up all we can!"

 runefather_worship.22.t:0 "Rune Makers Demand Resources"
 runefather_worship.22.d:0 "A delegation of the Amlruzskâppa Clan have approached the Obsidian Council asking for a redirection of resources from the Serpentspine. They claim that the Darkstone Clan has been monopolizing any and all metals and minerals from above, which they believe may even threatening the survival of the Empire’s blood runes entirely. The Darkstone delegates argue that there are plenty of resources to go around already, and that any reduction on their end will no doubt result in shortages for the Obsidian war machine."
 runefather_worship.22.a:0 "Side with the Amlruzskâppa delegates."
 runefather_worship.22.b:0 "Side with the Darkstone Delegates."
 runefather_worship.22.c:0 "Surely we can compromise?"

 runefather_worship.23.t:0 "Bejeweled Cannons"
 runefather_worship.23.d:0 "An overflow of exotic gems from the Serpentspine has resulted in a wave of aesthetic innovation, as Clan Darkstone’s smiths experiment with inlaying them in their creations. The most recent of these developments have been cannons bejeweled with hundreds of rubies, emeralds, and other precious gemstones. The result, while beautiful, provides no tactical advantage whatsoever."
 runefather_worship.23.a:0 "Well, they are quite pretty..."
 runefather_worship.23.b:0 "Take them out and sell them."

 runefather_worship.24.t:0 "Traders in the Serpentdepths."
 runefather_worship.24.d:0 "With our vengeance against the traitors in the Serpentspine progressing well, there have been numerous attempts from outsiders to open up trade relations with us. While many of these peoples have no ties to those who ravaged our homes and banished us millenia ago, they still could be a threat to our future position; however, some argue that there is still merit to trading with these outsiders in spite of the risk, especially considering the goods they can provide that we cannot find in our lands."
 runefather_worship.24.a:0 "We cannot give future enemies our secrets!"
 runefather_worship.24.b:0 "Trade will only strengthen us!"
 runefather_worship.24.c:0 "Leverage them into better deals"

 runefather_worship.25.t:0 "Superior Arms, Superior Tactics"
 runefather_worship.25.d:0 "Historians claim that there is no such thing as invincible armies, yet these so-called scholars have not met the growing might of the Obsidian Dwarves. The output of the Darkstone Clan and the advancements in tactics and armor by the Fûrdanhund has resulted in a modern military marvel. Cannons that can shatter any hold and infantry that can break the will of any shambling horde. The Dwarovar will be ours, and those who stand in our way will suffer."
 runefather_worship.25.a:0 "Welcome to Modern Warfare"

 runefather_worship.31.t:0 "Groedi-az-Ân Ensure Loyalty."
 runefather_worship.31.d:0 "Thanks to the efforts from the Groedi-az-Ân, the policies of the Dewara priests has resulted in a more unified doctrine towards the legendary Runefather. His faithful followers, through their guidance, are now more committed to the goal of reclaiming our legacy and exacting revengeance on the betrayers that banished us from our old home, and the monsters who have come to infest it."
 runefather_worship.31.a:0 "We honor him!"
 runefather_worship.31.b:0 "...but they can do more!"

 runefather_worship.32.t:0 "Groedi-az-Ân Purge"
 runefather_worship.32.d:0 "The Bâlvazha priests of the Groedi-az-Ân have opened a discussion with the Obsidian Council about the status of undesirables living in one of our provinces. They insist that these beasts be cleared out to make room for true followers of the Runefather. They claim that [event_province.GetName] is infested with traitors and other dissidents who stand in the way of his will. While this endeavor will be costly, the Bâlvazha assures the council that it is the fastest and most efficient way to spread the Runefather’s will."
 runefather_worship.32.a:0 "His will be done."
 runefather_worship.32.b:0 "His faithful stand ready."
 runefather_worship.32.c:0 "Let sleeping drakes lie."

 runefather_worship.33.t:0 "Runefather’s Sacrifice"
 runefather_worship.33.d:0 "There is no greater glory than giving your life for the Runefather, and no group that knows this better than the Groedi-az-Ân. Their Dewara priests have approached the council with a daring plan to ensure the Runefather’s plans succeed. Through a sacrifice of blood, sweat, and steel, those surplus soldiers not on campaign should help dig and construct more infrastructure in [event_province.GetName]. While it will be a noble sacrifice for the eternal one, the Fûrdanhund have raised objections, stating that it would be better for those soldiers to die fighting the enemy instead of constructing bigger holds."
 runefather_worship.33.a:0 "Listen to the Dewara"
 runefather_worship.33.b:0 "Listen to the Fûrdanhund"
 runefather_worship.33.c:0 "Utilize Amlruzskâppa Slaves."

 runefather_worship.34.t:0 "Obsidian Apostate?"
 runefather_worship.34.d:0 "The Bâlvazha and their inquisitors have brought forth a supposed apostate today who they claim does not worship the Runefather, instead worshipping different faiths of old. Numerous relics of dwarven kingdoms, orcish warbands, and goblin artifacts were found in his possession along with notes on their purpose.\n\nThe apostate claims that he is merely a historian, collecting the history of the Serpentspine for future generations. Further inspection of his contraband seems to strengthen his point, there being no sign of any worship of the traitors who once exiled us, nor the monsters who took their place. Yet the Bâlvazha remain firm in their accusations, dismissing arguments to the contrary as misinterpretations. They insist that we live up to the ideals of the Runefather and execute him for his transgressions."
 runefather_worship.34.a:0 "Let justice be done!"
 runefather_worship.34.b:0 "He is just a historian."

 runefather_worship.35.t:0 "History of the Obsidian Dwarovar"
 runefather_worship.35.d:0 "A new work of history has been published by the alleged apostate that the Obsidian Council showed mercy to 20 years ago. His book details the history and culture of the Dwarovar in the millenia since we were betrayed by our brothers, and does so in great detail. However, the historian has also worked tirelessly to show the faults and follies of the traitors, and the deserving fate exacted on them by history – proving the Runefather’s righteousness and the necessity of our actions to save our people. Runefather worshipers of all classes, from all across our realm, have viewed the book as a resounding justification for our actions across the Dwarovar."
 runefather_worship.35.a:0 "Get me a copy!"

 runefather_worship.36.t:0 "Obsidian Body and Soul"
 runefather_worship.36.d:0 "With support from the Shadowhammer Clan, the Groedi-az-Ân have become more experienced at cleansing newly conquered lands and rallying more brave soldiers for the Runefather. In the holds of the Dwarovar, all opposition has been ruthlessly hunted down, and as our glorious army marches forward, the Dewara and their priests cleanse the caverns for our loyal Obsidian Dwarf settlers to claim."
 runefather_worship.36.a:0 "The will of the Father is ours to carry out."

 runefather_worship.41.t:0 "High Quality Runes"
 runefather_worship.41.d:0 "The Amlruzskâppa have produced exceptional runes thanks to a surplus of slaves from our recent conquests. As a result, the safety of Adamantine barges and other runic networks in the empire have significantly improved, leading to a wide range of benefits across our empire."
 runefather_worship.41.a:0 "Praise the Runemakers!"
 runefather_worship.41.b:0 "...but we demand more!"

 runefather_worship.42.t:0 "Blood Slave Revolt"
 runefather_worship.42.d:0 "News has spread of a barge belonging to the Amlruzskâppa that has been hijacked by the goblin cargo it was carrying. The Amlruzskâppa delegates insist that we send a detachment of our soldiers to storm the vessel and secure control of it. While this seems rather extreme, the records show that it was one of our shipments of slaves, sent down from the Dwarovar, that revolted. On the other hand, Fûrdanhund delegates state that such an attack would be costly and it is better off to make our government pay and let the rune magic run out."
 runefather_worship.42.a:0 "Storm the barge!"
 runefather_worship.42.b:0 "Let them burn..."
 runefather_worship.42.c:0 "Test Experimental Tactics"

 runefather_worship.43.t:0 "New Rune Slaves?"
 runefather_worship.43.d:0 "With our departure from the Serpentdepths, we have come across a new enemy, that apparently destroyed the empire that had once betrayed us – Orcs. These barbarous brutes ravaged and pillaged their way across the Dwarovar until the recent Greentide thinned their numbers. With our recent conquests, we subjugated a significant population of these tremendous, if ill-disciplined, warriors. These new slaves could provide a better source of blood for our Runes compared to the scrawny goblins of the deep. The Amlruzskâppa are eager to try – yet some, led by members of the Darkstone Clan, fear that the orcs' physical strength could result in a stronger resistance than the Goblins."
 runefather_worship.43.a:0 "More fuel for the Runefather!"
 runefather_worship.43.b:0 "Purge them like the rest."

 runefather_worship.45.t:0 "Failed Blood Slave Revolt"
 runefather_worship.45.d:0 "Deep within [event_province.GetName], a massive revolt of goblins and orcs almost took control of the hold. The orcs charged the garrison to buy time for the goblins to seize control of vital chokepoints. Within hours, the coalition had near control of the keep, and were preparing to launch out and seize the rest of the hold. Had it not been for a nearby Fûrdanhund legion, then the revolt could have succeeded. The Harazherûd – leader of the Fûrdanhund – claims that the irresponsibility of the Amlruzskâppa nearly cost them an entire Dwarvenhold, all because they wanted some slightly stronger runes. But the Mâgunskâppa, leader of the blood-carvers, claims that the orcs were to be purged for the Runefather already, and that their blood did, in the end, provide for more effective runes.\n\nBut the costs were too great. In the end, the revolt saw most of the slave population of the hold being slaughtered, and much of the hold itself being devastated; after some debate, the Obsidian Council agreed to ban using orcish slaves for now."
 runefather_worship.45.a:0 "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

 runefather_worship.46.t:0 "Blood Orc Revolt!"
 runefather_worship.46.d:0 "Reports indicate that in [event_province.GetName], a massive slave revolt led by orcs and goblins has broken out. The sheer strength of the orcs allowed for them to push back the garrison while the goblins snuck around and seized vital checkpoints. Before any reinforcements could arrive, the army managed to seize absolute control of the hold’s fortifications.\n\nFrom there, the slaves began pilfering the hold, slaughtering the population, and destroying as much of the infrastructure as they could. The Mâgunskâppa of the Fûrdanhund has warned the Obsidian Council that with the hold seized, it would be necessary to put down this army and begin the lengthy and torturous process of retaking the hold. There is no doubt – the Amlruzskâppa’s experiment has come to a dramatic end."
 runefather_worship.46.a:0 "By the Runefather"

 runefather_worship.47.t:0 "Runic Inquisition"
 runefather_worship.47.d:0 "With the help of the Bâlvazha priests of the Groedi-az-Ân, the Amlruzskâppa has managed to produce a new set of blood runes to help our inquisitors scry, hunt down and purge any who are not dedicated to the great Runefather. In addition to this, the growing cooperation between these two factions have resulted in a further spread of blood runes across the administration, allowing for the Groedi-az-Ân’s Dewara to manage doctrine and organize the state better. The Obsidian Council has already given the approval of these new runes, and now the runesmiths have begun mass production."
 runefather_worship.47.a:0 "Blood Runes are destined to rule!"

 runefather_worship.51.t:0 "The Runefather’s Bravest"
 runefather_worship.51.d:0 "News has come in from the Harazherûd, the leader of the Fûrdanhund. Apparently, a new batch of recruits have shown exceptional ability in the field of combat. Other members of the Fûrdanhund report that these developments will improve our legions and aid us in our quest to bring the Runefather’s justice to the Dwarovar. A spell, after all, is only as strong as its weakest rune."
 runefather_worship.51.a:0 "All for the Eternal Father!"
 runefather_worship.51.b:0 "Let us give these recruits the funding they deserve!"

 runefather_worship.52.t:0 "Fûrdanhund Wishes to Massacre"
 runefather_worship.52.d:0 "Members of the Fûrdanhund have approached the Obsidian Council with news of the latest siege. They report that our glorious armies have taken control of the fortress, but they have taken prisoner a large amount of undesirables in the process. Normal protocol would be the complete annihilation of the prisoners to rally the troops, but some fear that the international backlash in doing so would provoke a strong reaction from our neighbours, that may not be strategically desirable."
 runefather_worship.52.a:0 "Let the Troops have their fun!"
 runefather_worship.52.b:0 "Enslave them instead."

 runefather_worship.53.t:0 "Fûrdanhund Devoted Disobeys Orders"
 runefather_worship.53.d:0 "A peculiar case has made its way up to the Obsidian Council at the request of the Harazherûd. A soldier serving in battle committed the treasonous act of disobeying the orders of her superiors, yet her actions saved her commander and fellow soldiers. The case has been slowly making its way up the military courts, until finally it has reached the highest authority of the empire. The Harazherûd argues that insubordination is punishable no matter what, while some members of the Darkstone Clan claim that her actions show her loyalty to the Runefathers' cause. The trial is long, raucous, and winding. Nonetheless, in the end, the Obsidian Council ruled that..."
 runefather_worship.53.a:0 "...she is guilty."
 runefather_worship.53.b:0 "...she is innocent."

 runefather_worship.54.t:0 "Legions harassed along the Dwarovrod"
 runefather_worship.54.d:0 "As our army expands across the Dwarovar, we find ourselves facing major issues with logistics. Our transportation networks from the Serpentdepths to the far reaches of our realm are plagued with harassment from traitors and monsters of all kinds, who wish to see our realm shatter and fall back into the depths. As a result, the Fûrdanhund have drafted a plan to take active soldiers and deploy them along vulnerable routes to protect valuable supplies. The only issue with such a plan is that it would spread our already thin manpower even further."
 runefather_worship.54.a:0 "Dedicate the Patrols."
 runefather_worship.54.b:0 "Forgo the Patrols."
 runefather_worship.54.c:0 "Utilize Amlruzskâppa Runes."
 runefather_worship.54.e:0 "Ask the Bâlvazha for help."

 runefather_worship.55.t:0 "Runic Warfare"
 runefather_worship.55.d:0 "As our armies continue to march across the Serpentspine in the name of the Eternal Runefather, there is a growing need to ensure that our military is always one step ahead of our enemies. Fortunately, the cooperation between the Fûrdanhund and the Amlruzskâppa has resulted in a glorious fusion of runic magic and modern military strength. Soldiers are equipped not just with the latest weaponry, but also runes to bolster their defenses. With these upgrades, our opponents will never stand a chance."
 runefather_worship.55.a:0 "The Runefather’s vengeance is assured!"

 runefather_worship.61.t:0 "Runic Brother War"
 runefather_worship.61.d:0 "Many Millennia ago, we fought in the grand campaign against the invaders of the Dwarovar. While our allies were fighting a losing battle, we chose to find a new path to win the war. It is there that we uncovered the holy secrets of blood rune magic which helped turn the tide against the invaders. Our so-called “kin”, in blind jealousy, rallied together and marched to put the ones who saved them down. It was in these crucial moments the Nameless King sacrificed himself for our people, and plunged us into the Serpentdepths.\n\nIn so doing, the Nameless King ascended to become the Eternal Runefather, and we began rebuilding our empire in the deep depths of the world. When we emerged thousands of years later, we found that without our help, the dwarves lost everything, as savages and monsters overran them. Yet, new Dwarven nations are forming across the caverns seeking to steal the Runefather’s birthright."
 runefather_worship.61.a:0 "Give the traitors their due"

 runefather_worship.62.t:0 "The Oldest Enemy"
 runefather_worship.62.d:0 "The Harazherûd has approached the Obsidian Council with information about the Runefather’s newest enemy… although they are not as unfamiliar as we may think. Our ancient enemy of goblins still roam the caverns and holds of the Serpentspine, threatening the periphery of our empire. Before the traitor dwarves, before the orcs, before the precursors, there were the goblins. Ever present, ever a nuisance.\n\nFortunately, we have had time to learn their tricks down here in the dark, the deep goblins we have hunted and enslaved providing the empire with the blood to fuel our runes. Compared to our place-of-exile, where the goblins possessed massive cities of their own, the squatters of the Serpentspine merely serve as another obstacle in our path to to reclaiming the Runefather’s birthright, and an opportunity to bring in more slaves to expand rune production."
 runefather_worship.62.a:0 "An ancient grudge match renewed!"

 runefather_worship.63.t:0 "The Cursed Orcs"
 runefather_worship.63.d:0 "Upon escaping our banishment, we discovered that the Dwarovar was overrun not by the goblins, or the armies of the long-eared immortals we tried to protect our home from, but by a new form of monster. These orcs arrived shortly after our banishment and over the thousands of years we were gone, they pillaged and marauded across the Dwarovar, until nearly all the Dwarven holds had been destroyed.\n\nToday, the orcs are still just as fearsome as they were over 7000 years ago. Their raw strength and power can easily topple any ordinary dwarf in combat. But we possess the blessings of the Runefather which nearly destroyed the armies of the elves before – and after some unknown calamity some years ago, the orc’s numbers have thinned. Our runic magic and perseverance will destroy this blight upon the world and reclaim all that was lost for the Obsidian Dwarves."
 runefather_worship.63.a:0 "All must die!"

 runefather_worship.64.t:0 "Strange Little Dragons"
 runefather_worship.64.d:0 "Returning to the upper Serpentspine after centuries of isolation, we discovered another race has begun to inhabit the caverns. These creatures look similar to the dragons and drakes from stories of old, and their fanaticism towards these great serpents seems to indicate a deeper relationship.\n\nMilitarily, these Kobolds lack physical strength and courage, but they appear to make up for it with their ingenuity and ability to reproduce at exceptional rates. Their strange weaponry, which allows even non-mages to wield the captive power of magic, has proven to be as effective against our runes and their trap making has already cost the lives of many of our scout parties. As such, doctrines are being established to counter such a strange race."
 runefather_worship.64.a:0 "Focus on crushing them!"

 runefather_worship.71.t:0 "Fate of the Blood Slaves"
 runefather_worship.71.d:0 "With our conquest of a hold from the Obsidian Empire, a large number of goblin slaves were found as prisoners in its depths, no doubt to be used in the production of their blood runes. It is now up to us to decide the fate of these slaves."
 runefather_worship.71.a:0 "Free them at once!"
 runefather_worship.71.b:0 "More slaves for us!"
 runefather_worship.71.c:0 "Just exile them."

 runefather_worship.81.t:0 "Debate over Military Doctrine"
 runefather_worship.81.d:0 "Troubling news has come to our attention, as it seems there has been some sort of deadlock within the military over the it should take. The envoys of Clan Shadowhammer claim that the mass mobilization of loyalists to our armies will allow us conquer the Serpentspine faster, while the Fûrdanhund claim that it would compromise the integrity of our military – its professionalism and integrity. While we wait for a compromise to be found, our general staff are too afraid to make a choice without permission, hindering our forces."
 runefather_worship.81.a:0 "We are fighting ourselves!"

 runefather_worship.82.t:0 "Clan Darkstone Drags its heels"
 runefather_worship.82.d:0 "The Groedi-az-Ân have been supporting us in converting the Serpentspine even since we proved the success of our surface campaigns, but the still-reluctant Darkstone clan has begun to drag their heels in the Obsidian Council, in an effort to withdraw material and clerical support from us in favour of their industrial complexes in the Serpentdepths. While we can plead the Groedi-az-Ân’s case and maintain their support, the Council appears to favor the Darkstone clan in this initiative."
 runefather_worship.82.a:0 "Politics is a mess..."
 runefather_worship.82.b:0 "We still have some sway."

 runefather_worship.83.t:0 "Groedi-az-Ân Blames the Army"
 runefather_worship.83.d:0 "The Groedi-az-Ân have begun a smear campaign against the Fûrdanhund and our army for an apparent failure to maintain religious doctrine whilst on campaign. They cite numerous instances where proper ceremony and rites were ignored by officers and soldiers. Our generals and the Fûrdanhund claim that it would be impractical to actually perform proper ceremonies during wartime, as it slows down troops and waste resources, yet the Groedi-az-Ân have spent considerable effort rallying our own clergy against us for our failure."
 runefather_worship.83.a:0 "Soldiers fight, not priests!"

 runefather_worship.84.t:0 "Amlruzskâppa Spread Too Thin!"
 runefather_worship.84.d:0 "The Shadowhammer clan’s constant desire to expand its reach over the Serpentspine has resulted in the Amlruzskâppa rune makers being stretched thin. There is so much they need to do to secure our Dwarovar-empire, and our continued relentless expansion is adding more to their workload without providing a commensurate amount of raw materials to allow them to keep up. Even with every shipment of fresh slaves and metals, it simply takes too long to craft, enchant, and ship back the runes. This will doubtless cause problems across our empire."
 runefather_worship.84.a:0 "Have we tried more blood?"

 runefather_worship.85.t:0 "Fûrdanhund Outmaneuvered"
 runefather_worship.85.d:0 "The Darkstone clan is relatively young, gaining prominence for their successes in capturing several Deepcities in the Serpentdepths – this innovation has continued throughout their rise, and a recent maneuver has resulted in them superseding the Fûrdanhund in military developments. With the Fûrdanhund’s reputation bruised, and the Darkstone emboldened, there is a growing concern that there will be a decline in military support as the Darkstone clan shifts attention away from our military in the Serpentspine and back to their interests in the Serpentdepths."
 runefather_worship.85.a:0 "Damnable Darkstone!"

 runefather_worship.100.t:0 "Contact From Below"
 runefather_worship.100.d:0 "Sleepless and wandering alone in the dark halls of [Root.Capital.GetName], [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has heard some whispers deep in the hallways. Venturing to investigate what kind of schemes are at play at the dead of night, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walked closer to what seemed like an unnatural darkness, slowly closing in with the whispers resounding much more audibly.\n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\nFear overwhelmed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] name echoed louder and louder through the space, with an eerie otherworldly voice. “You have proven to be a strong leader, however your nation reeks of weakness. True power can only come from the Runefather, my power that has dominated the vast lands below you and soon the caverns you reside in. You have a choice, prove your worth and serve me, or perish beneath the faithful. Prepare to sacrifice anything.”\n\nThe darkness suddenly disappears, and just as quickly, the torches flare up with roaring fires. A remaining echo filled the mind of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“Do you accept?”"
 runefather_worship.100.a:0 "This is preposterous!"
 runefather_worship.100.b:0 "True power you say?"

 runefather_worship.101.t:0 "Test of Faith"
 runefather_worship.101.d:0 "Eagerly expecting for the Runefather to contact [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] once more wandered down dark halls, desperately listening for any whispers and extinguishing torches just for the chance of the Runefather contacting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] again. Many sleepless nights had passed, as [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] began to lose faith, however in the most unexpected time, many whispers suddenly filled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind and darkness covered the room.\n\n“Sacrifice”\n\n”Show no mercy, no failure and no hesitation. Sacrifice one dear to you, to demonstrate your willingness to follow my decrees, so that you may never hesitate ever again. With blood you will pay the price of power so high beyond your understanding. It is only the strong that can make a decision so unforgivable by your kin. Abandon your past self and devote all to the Runefather.”\n\nAs quickly as the whispers and darkness had appeared, so did they all fade away. With such a difficult decision, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] alone debated whether to sacrifice their kin, or abandon such deranged actions."
 runefather_worship.101.a:0 "This price is unforgivable."
 runefather_worship.101.b:0 "Abandon love. Embrace power."

 runefather_worship.102.t:0 "The Last Step"
