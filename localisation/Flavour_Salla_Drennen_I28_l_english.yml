 I28_sprouting_thorns_desc:0 "When I was but a child my mother took me to the edge of the grove. We sat there amongst the thorned shrubs and she asked me whether I saw their beauty.\n\nI confess, I did not. To my young eyes they were hostile, angry things with ugly thorns that promised pain - where was the beauty in that? She laughed, and told me that I thought like our neighbours, but one day when I am older I would see the beauty in defiance - to be unyielding in the face of nature's design.\n\nI am not that much older, or so they tell me, but I know now my mother was right. I see the invaders bleed upon those same thorns, and I realise there is beauty in them - in the perseverance."

 I28_springs_first_flower_desc:0 "No Salla has survived the greentide unscathed.\n\nEven mighty Elyn, who would consider themselves first among equals (though sometimes I doubt they think far beyond first), have found their territory snatched and stolen by the opportunistic goblins of the Brambleskinner clan. The lives lost are a tragedy, for I would never wish ill upon my kin - certainly not the many innocents whose villages and homes were destroyed.\n\nYet I cannot help but notice the opportunity on offer. Our pact is a fragile thing, a flower first budding. For it to succeed the other clans need hope, they need victories, so that they may put their faith in unity as I do. Together with Elyn we outmatch the goblins, and so together we shall cast them from our groves. The first victory of the united wood elves shall be as the first flower of spring, the sign of more to follow."

 I28_down_the_mountainside_desc:0 "Salla Myna were the first to fight the greentide, dispelling scattered clanless orcs driven into our woods by knights of the old Blademarches. They, like we, have suffered greatly. Saved only by the sale of Bricena’s hand (a sacrifice for which I admire her) and the great steep cliffs of Ciranmyna, they have as much reason to loathe the orc as any other.\n\nWhen I brought us to the aid of Elyn, it was not without selfish motive of my own, for our lands too were under the goblin yoke. When the clanselves of Drennen march into the mountain grove, it shall be wholly in the name of a united people."

 I28_more_than_words_desc:0 "I have promised many things to many people. Sometimes I worry my heart and tongue may move faster than my mind in this regard, and yet I have never made a promise I did not intend to keep - so when I promised the Ceanna of Elyn and Myna that together we would never fall again, I meant it.\n\nBut words, sweet as they may sound, can be as the wind. My promise shall be more than that. Towering battlements and safe sanctuaries we will create, then I shall raise my hand and weave from magic arcane wards and thorned barriers. Then my words shall be as earth."

 I28_bonds_that_blossom_title:0 "Bonds That Blossom"
 I28_bonds_that_blossom_desc:0 "At the Conclave of Elynaile, a beautiful, delicate thing was born out of the discord and chaos of a dozen different egos and interests. I will not, in public, push my part in the pact we have forged (though in private I must confess a certain pride in it), for the bonds are yet new  - not ready to bear renewed strain and strife among us.\n\nBattle will test them soon no doubt, but I would rather have more than simple pledge linking our Salla. The marriage between mine and Alara's kin has proven its worth mending the bonds between two clans - I wonder if my father’s wisdom will hold true at scale."

 I28_fruits_of_cooperation_title:0 "The Fruits of Co-operation"
 I28_fruits_of_cooperation_desc:0 "Sometimes I look at all we have achieved together and I scarcely believe my own eyes. Three glades reclaimed, villages and towns resettled, the orcs and goblins driven out. Not since before Oberon's flight have our people controlled so much of our land uncontested.\n\nI have not forgotten that there is yet much more that waits to be done. The Bone Grove houses countless goblins of Oubliggschild, and to the east many glades and once proud Salla wait to be reclaimed.\n\nStill, I can allow myself a measure of joy. Even the most reticent members of our pact can now surely see its benefits - and perhaps what more we might achieve through ever closer union. With a push, and the right words in the right ears, I will surely make them."

 I28_blood_and_bone_title:0 "Blood And Bone"
 I28_blood_and_bone_desc:0 "Alara brings the matter of her Salla grove to me, those lands of Bone still occupied by goblins. She asks me to bring our armies south, and to reclaim the glade for her clanselves. She is right to do so, we have allowed Cenag to aid the others without recompense for too long. Yet I find something heavy about the request, in a way I did not before.\n\nI am the leader of our pact now, and they all look to me for direction. When we go to the Bone grove, and we will, it will be because I declared so. Perhaps to some it seems little different leading four Salla than leading one, but not to me. I feel the weight of the burden- I only hope I shall live up to it. Both Alara and Lanhara seem to think I will. Perhaps when the Bone grove is reclaimed I shall prove them right."

 I28_love_maybe_title:0 "Love, Maybe"
 I28_love_maybe_desc:0 "What can heal the wounds of war, or the bitter scars of a blood feud? A division first born of misunderstanding, but rent further with every life lost. Before the conclave I asked myself that question almost everyday. I would stand atop my balcony and look south, to where my heart - if not my eyes - knew Salla Cenag lay.\n\nWhen I arranged the conclave, it was Alara and her Salla I dreaded seeing most of all. It was Alara and her Salla that almost destroyed my dream in the wake of the avatar's arrival, when she declared their participation over and stormed out of our gathering. My parents, her brothers. All the lives lost as a result of our uncle's foolishness stood between us, the gap simply too wide. I almost cried then, when she turned her back, though I know better than to let tears show to others.\n\nWho would have thought that the same man who caused that chasm would too first bridge it? Even after uncle Arun explained to me his plan to speak to Alara, I nary dreamed she would listen. Yet somehow she did, and now we call each other sister again.\n\nWhat then can heal the wounds of war? As I plan a wedding between our two extended kins, I wonder."

 I28_face_the_axe_m_desc:0 "How do you make a scared, tired elf stand tall and fight, even in the face of a new and savage foe?\n\nSome would say to be a greater terror than any invader. That fear may be bested by fear alone, that a soldier who fears you more than the enemy will never turn from them - lest they meet your eyes instead.\n\nI find there is some truth in this, for when one believes they have no better option they will fight twice as hard- but I cannot believe that to best terror we must become it. Instead, I propose that you must give them heart. You must make them believe that battle is the better option, but not because of the fear of discipline or reprisal. You must make them believe it is the better option because they can win - more than that, that they will win, if they face the fear.\n\nIf they face the axe."

 I28_takedown_title:0 "Takedown"
 I28_takedown_desc:0 "My cousin, my friends, my clan all tell me I have a pure heart - a kind soul. I believe them. I have never loved war, that awful thing that took my parents away from me, and I wince to see suffering.\n\nBut here I must confess, in my heart there is hate. I hate Khagur Sapchopper. I hate his whole clan. It was not just war that took my parents - took our home! - it was him. Him and his savages. Still he squats in our grove, but no longer. We will take him down - fell his clan like the trees from which they claim namesake.\n\nThen I will break him into pieces. A creature with no feelings doesn’t deserve to live, it's obvious."

 I28_voice_unwavering_desc:0 "There are many grudges and disputes amongst our Salla. Friction and faction is a fact of life, but of all Salla today the strife between Fealgarn and Ayeth simmers hottest.\n\nIt is not a grudge born misunderstanding, as was our’s and Cenag’s. No, this is a grudge born from opposed interest, a real wrong done. But no matter what the cause may be, we cannot allow ourselves to remain divided any longer. Strength in unity works - my friends and I have proved this. Salla Drennen, Cenag, Myna and Elyn, together we have all proved this.\n\nI forgive Elaria his loathing, and I forgive Oberon his flight. What yet remains is for them to forgive one another."

 I28_how_its_done_title:0 "How Its Done"
 I28_how_its_done_desc:0 "When I consider the matter, it is hard to think of a figure more controversial than my uncle, Arun Drennen.\n\nHe was perhaps the greatest mage of our era (here I must note some deep part of my inner self wishes this title for myself), and certainly the most ambitious and dedicated, his desire for knowledge and quest for freedom admirable. Without him the veil would never have fallen, and the greentide would have never ended. In a very real sense, we owe him all our lives.\n\nHe was also the man almost singlehandedly responsible for the near annihilation of our Salla, for in the process of investigating the veil his apprentice Eledas Cenag - Alara’s brother - lost his life. Along with this, my uncle lost his memory. Unable to explain Eledas’s death, he fled from the ‘justice’ of Cenag, who branded him a kinslayer, and sought refuge in his home here in Drennen. I will not recite the whole bloody tale, for it is a time I would wish to forget, but suffer to say that it is equally true that on his hands lies the blame for every death in the Cousins’ war.\n\nSo then, what is my uncle's legacy? I will not tell anyone else what to think of him, certainly not Alara, but privately I admit some amount of admiration. He knew his goal and walked the path required to achieve it, magic his method and means. If there is a lesson to take from him, it is that whilst we must be careful on the path, through magic the impossible may be realised - dreams may become reality."

 I28_the_tattered_veil_title:0 "The Tattered Veil"
 I28_the_tattered_veil_desc:0 "For centuries the Verdant Veil defined not only my entire people, but the whole Deepwoods and all its denizens. Now, it lies in tatters, its source - the eldest - gone. It is a strange, unfamiliar world outside, but neither the bright, open fields of Escann nor the vast waters of the Divenhal hold any interest to me. No, unlike others my eyes seek not beyond our forest border, for I cast my gaze within - at the opportunity this tattered veil presents.\n\nIt does not surprise me that I am the only one to see it, for it requires both a mastery of magic and familiarity with the Fey that few, if any (bar I!) possess. Still, Varinna and Elethen both seem to agree now that I have explained my idea to them.\n\nWhen I told them first that I believed that the remains of the veil (that is, the imprint of it upon the planar boundaries) could be harnessed to lessen the warping effect of the Feyrealm on our material world they were dubious. But they always listen, and so they did at length while I droned on with endless magical theory.\n\nNow the time for theory is past - together we will act."

 I28_restoring_the_bonds_title:0 "Restoring The Bonds"
 I28_restoring_the_bonds_desc:0 "Our discovery in the tower has proved my theory about the veil correct!\n\nI have precious little time to celebrate, for monumental work remains to be done. The veil is an immense thing, and our miniscule effort so far has barely scratched the surface of its potential. I lament that uncle Arun is not here to see this - I think he would’ve enjoyed seeing his work continued like this, to say nothing of how much help he would be!\n\nEnough of my blathering enthusiasm (sometimes I fear my youth betrays me). We must take our work into the world and find a place where the borders between the Feyrealm and our plane thin to test our spell. Elethen has suggested we try a Gladeway - that shall do nicely!\n\nVarinna bids us caution, but I fail to see why. What could possibly go wrong?"

 I28_cultivate_the_grove_title:0 "Cultivate The Grove"

Certainly it is the oldest - our records say that there in the secret grove of Loencyanthanél was where mage first became druid, a transition we now attribute to the ample ambient life magic present in the grove.\n\nWhatever the truth may be, the Moonmoss Druids have long been friend to my Salla - I myself studied there for a time (though I am NO druid!). Now more than ever we have need of their magical expertise - as powerful as I am, no mage is better alone."

Yet in my Salla darkest hour - when I was alone and afraid - so I did, and contrary to all reason my doing so may be the sole reason we stand today.\n\nIs it foolhardy to think that to do so a second time is not a risk, but an informed decision? The question is rhetorical of course, for I have already made up my mind. I shall again seek my friend (can I call them that?), the fey known as the Weaver of Ways and seek their help. Drennen may no longer be alone, but then we never were.\n\nI do not write this as a treatise to my wisdom, but rather as a reassurance to myself."

I confess the thought of treating with one makes me nervous, let alone multiple. The Fey Queen, the Lord of Darkness - titles such as these are invoked in the grandest of tales. What is one Ceanna to beings such as they? I am nothing to them, who rule entire courts of distant realms, who have seen ages pass and to whom mortal lives must be as the passing of the seasons, if not the mere blink of an eye.\n\nWe are small next to them- so, so small. Yet that is all the more reason to try - for what great might we may have behind us if they but move a finger. I shall bring Varinna and Elethen with me, as far as they will go at least. It’s easier when I’m not alone."

Then, the Feyrealm. Still a place you can touch, still a place with things, still a place of the solid and material - but also a place of more.\n\nWhen I walk the Feyrealm my fingers touch not just earth and tree, but aether and mist. It is ever shifting, ever changing, always awe inspiring. No matter how many places I walk there, no matter how many Archfey I seek, I never lose that sense of wonder."

Never would we have achieved such breakthroughs on the veil without their insights - to say nothing of the fact that my dear Elethen was one of their number!\n\nBut it has made me wonder, why do we restrict our magical tutorage so tightly? Howsoever grand the Moonmoss circle may be, would not two thriving circles be grander, and would not three be yet more grander still? And so on, and so on.\n\nI should ask what Varinna and Elethen think of leading circles themselves…"

I should’ve listened to Varinna. It is ironic, really, that I should fall victim to the same flaw as my uncle, and to the same source no less!\n\nFortunately, my tragedy is much less than his. The elves that died to the fey challengers will be mourned deeply, their weight forever etched on my soul, but no new cousins' war will arise of this. No clans will fall- we've simply suffered a setback.\n\nVarinna bids me caution still, and this time I shall listen. Before I was overconfident, hasty. This time we will do nothing alone. My friends and I shall be joined by the mages of our entire Salla, and together we will work a symphony impossible for three alone."

When I stood before the Fey Queen herself I did not feel as much trepidation as I did in that hall.\n\nI wish I could tell my younger self that all that effort was not for nothing. That when I look now at all we have achieved it brings tears to my eyes.

I know you’ve kept diaries extensively since we read your uncle’s. I see you scribbling there! You’re writing what I’m saying!\n\nWell, if I get to have my voice in the record, I assume Varinna does too?\n\nExcellent. Elethen and Varinna, companions to and chroniclers of the great Ceanna Narawen Drennen. That has a nice ring to it. What do you mean I'm not allowed to self aggrandise? What's the point of being interviewed if I can't flatter myself!\n\nYou’re a dreadful bore sometimes you know. But I do love you, and I’m sure whoever ends up reading your chronicle will appreciate your diligence.\n\nShall we get started then? You know me, I can talk all day."

Where we celebrated the ‘fulfilment of the pact’. At least that’s what you said in your speech. All humour aside, it was beautiful. I don’t know how you always find the words, always and without fail.\n\nFor a long time I thought our people were doomed. Most of my life actually. Then you and your silver tongue spun a story of hope, and through sheer will and magical might made it a reality. The feast was when it happened, when the bonds between Elyn, Myna, Cenag and Drennen stopped mattering. When you made them not matter! When you convinced us all that the way forward, the best and only way forward, was together.\n\nIt helps that the meal was really good. Yes I know I ate too much! But what else are you supposed to do at a celebration? Besides, you abandoned me and Varinna at another table to flatter the other Cean and Ceanna. I saw you make Alara laugh from the heart, and even courtly Bricena (SPELLING) was warm to you. Old ELYNGUY didn’t even mind that he wasn't seated at the head of the table!

Of the times I remember… I’d have to say after we reclaimed the Bone Grove.\n\nI remember it distinctly, the five of us there: me, you, Varinna, Alara, Lanhara. We were atop a hill, overlooking the remains - the husk, really - of an old elven village. That makes it sound like a sorry sight, doesn’t it? But it wasn’t - it was beautiful, a village that we’d lost for at least a decade, where the plants and animals had fled, now free to bloom again.\n\nI know I wasn’t alone in thinking that, not least because Alara said it out loud. Her tears would’ve given it away anyway, her love for her people and land is something I admire about her. But I’m getting distracted, what it really was that set me off - and you as well - was her words. I don’t think I’ve ever heard an elf more grateful. She called you her idol. An almost childish thing, and yet it really hits the heart, doesn’t it? Alara was always good at making you cry. I wonder if it’s because she’s basically the only blood family you have lef-\n\nOh Narawen, I’m so sorry!"

You were the pride of our Salla already, but we hadn’t truly seen your grace, the ease with which you glided through the glade of society. Not until then.\n\nDon’t let this go to your head! This is before I knew you were as much a mortal as I - but I digress.\n\nI remember being so thrilled to be in the crowd, a meagre woodself as myself in the clan hall. Yes, yes, I know I’m a mage - it doesn’t change how the little girl inside myself felt. Whilst I was bewildered by my surroundings, there you were. I remember seeing you on the balcony overlooking the Ceremony, Alara and Lanhara sat with you. What a sight that was, so mundane, and yet so powerful. You leaned over to them at one point, whispered something, and they both laughed. In that simple scene, the scars of the Cousins war were smoothed over."

Your lightning is terrifying, but it wasn’t that that scared me - it was the look in your eyes.\n\nI’ve never seen you like that before; you’re normally so.. hopeful. Sweet. My warm friend. But I didn’t see any of her in you that day. I just saw fire. It’s what I picture the Ashentree fey to be, all hate and loathing.\n\nYou stood over the captured orcs, Alara besides you in her ornate armour. Judge and executioner. I was just in earshot, and I felt your rage as you said “I hate them, Alara.”\n\nI will never think less of you, no matter what, but I admit my heart stood still as I listened to her reply:"

It was quite cute really, you were nestled so close over one particular tome your noses were almost touching.\n\nImagine how all of our lives would differ had I not had the boldness to approach you then. Though that is much like saying if things were different, then they would differ. Still, it does fascinate me how small things have big consequences. Perhaps it is but the beat of a butterfly's wing that set the chain of history in motion.\n\n‘Stop musing and answer the question?’ How rude. Yes, I enjoyed our meeting, of course I did. There’s little I love more than talking to intellectual equals, so meeting one in Elethen was fantastic.\n\nOw! Don’t hit me. Fine, one and a half.

Specifically, our first discovery.\n\nDo you remember? We were in the Drennethile tower. It was new then, very new. The top floor was our space, solely and completely, even the orrery chamber. We had just read one of your uncle's papers on applied abjuration, and Elethen, beautiful fool that she is, had the brilliant idea of treating the veil like an abjuration lattice. I will forgive her any flaws for her flashes of genius.\n\nI have never seen a spell, nor anything at all, so beautiful. The whole room lit up with swirling light of purple and blueish hue, so thick I could almost touch it - not to mention the magical effect. That feeling of being grounded, everything just a little more material. We’re used to it now of course, but back then… What a strange sensation.\n\nDo not make that face at me, of course I am skipping the details.

The Weaver of Ways.\n\nI am sure you need not be reminded, but I shall anyway, because the sheer childlike glee exhibited by a near full grown elf is something that I shall never cease to tease you about. For you, it was a reunion with an old friend. For me, it was the first time I ever faced the Fey directly. I did not enjoy the bucket of water they spilt on me, no matter how much amusement it brought the three of you.\n\nIt is not just the glee that I remember, but what they said too. Only you could possibly be friends with a trickster fey, and only you could possibly take it seriously when it told you that it would be a good idea to petition the Archfey for assistance. Really Narawen - the Archfey!\n\nYou would prove my doubt wrong, of course. Did you later stand before the throne of the Fey Queen just because I scoffed at you that day?"

salla_drennen.9.d: "The greatest thing we have ever done?\n\nI presume you are expecting what I am about to say, given how you asked me right after I was already talking about the Veil. How could I possibly say anything else? You have many personal triumphs, but I can think of nothing greater that we have done together than building not just a new world, but a new reality.\n\nA reality where a tool that you lay down after you have finished with it stays where you leave it. A world where towns and villages do not disappear into the feyrealm for days on end, where children can be safe to send outside unaccompanied for fear they end up in a gladeway.\n\nIt is not total of course, nor should we wish it to be. We are not who we are without our relationship with the fey, and it is not all bad, as well you know. But even so, if the names Varinna and Elethen are to be remembered alongside yours in our history, it shall be for this."
