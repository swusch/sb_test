 rezankand_arrival_at_taychend_desc:0 "When first we arrived at the shores of Zenzarkand, our old home, or Aelantir as the Moon Elves call it, we were gladdened to see that the ruin had not meant the end for our kin, as we encountered their descendants. However, while the arid land that we found ourselves in reminded us of our former home-in-exile far to the east, there were no ancient cities with a storied past to be found, nor thriving farming villages lining the shores of the rivers. Our distant kin instead lived an existence of nomadic migrations, leaving little trace of their passing.\n\nImagine our astonishment then, when our intrepid sailors explored the coastline to the west and after rounding a cape with steep mountains towering over the sea, came upon Katelperai, as its inhabitants called the city. A city of terraced layers climbing up the mountain from the shore, with imposing fortifications guarding every entrance, it was the first indisputable proof that civilization had not forsaken the lands of our ancestors!"

 rezankand_jahers_duty_title:0 "Jaher's Duty" # takasaki
 rezankand_jahers_duty_desc:0 "As we vanquish the slaver-warlords who rule Taychend, we are gradually learning more about this land and its history. Since the Ruin, the Taychendi have been ruled by a succession of warlord empires, trapped in an infinite cycle of slavery, violence, conquest and collapse. It is our duty to fight the Dark, no matter what form it takes and the warlords of Taychend seem to be typical enemies of the light. We are Jaher’s chosen – and like he vanquished the Red Xhaz on his arrival to Bulwar, so shall we vanquish all who stand against us in Taychend."

 rezankand_first_clash_title:0 "First Clash" # takasaki
 rezankand_first_clash_desc:0 "It is no wonder that the Taychendi are so afraid of foreign invaders. Many years before our arrival, an exceptional Kheionai elf named “Laskaris the Conqueror” invaded Taychend – his state, Ameion, had made it their mission to bring order to Taychend, by enforcing their own culture, philosophy, and governance. Though we share some of the same goals, we are nothing like them in truth – the Ambhen imperialists must be vanquished for us to truly bring the light to Taychend!"

 rezankand_secrets_of_the_sundancer_desc:0 "Though we are slowly grasping Taychend’s immensity, the gargantuan city of Nanru Nakar, a Precursor city interspersed with grand Taychendi temples and shanty-slums alike, continues to confound us. However, from our initial investigations we have discovered that the city – especially its warren-like undercity – holds many Precursor relics that could potentially be used to reactivate the Diranhriá’s long broken damestear core – perhaps it is time to investigate them?"

 rezankand_precursor_treasures_title:0 "Precursor Treasures" # takasaki
 rezankand_precursor_treasures_desc:0 "The Diranhriá’s reactivation seems to have greatly excited Karodir Varamzuir – his office has began to produce list upon list of potential relic sites within Taychend, ranging from unexplored ruins to entire cities needing to be scoured – the temples and shrines of Taychend’s many Hero-Cults also featuring prominently. The Taychendi will not be happy that we are ransacking their temples and ruins, be it for reasons of blasphemy or simple property – but what is their present happiness to liberation, order, peace? If it takes scouring our brothers’ Precursor treasures to save them from darkness, so be it."

 rezankand_dispel_the_dark_title:0 "Dispel the Dark" # takasaki
 rezankand_dispel_the_dark_desc:0 "We have done so much work, liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves, Dazinkion’s light shattering warlord and Kheionai armies alike – but reality is beginning to catch up to us. Despite what we have done for them, it is becoming clear that the traditionalist Taychendi absolutely despise us, seeing Ecaris as little more than another Laskaris, dedicated to destroying their way of life. Luckily, not all share that view – sympathetic freed slaves, alongside some members of the strange new “Oren Nayiru” movement, are more than willing to both follow us back to the Dry Coast and pick up our fight back in Taychend respectively. One day, we will be back – but for now, we must rest, and take back all the brothers we can save."
 
 rezankand_homecoming_title:0 "Homecoming" #Jeck
 rezankand_homecoming_desc:0 "The journey to what was both our new and our ancestral home was long and arduous. After traversing the entire length of the Divenhal sea our fleet rounded the Ekhani cape, ever wary of the gnollish pirates that infest those shores, and left the safety of the coastal waters of Sarhal to chart a course into the unknown, only guided by fragmentary maps and old tales from the time of the remnant fleet. The lengthy crossing tested our faith in Surael, but at long last we sighted the shores of Zenzarkand. We first came upon an inhospitable stretch of dense jungle and mangrove forests, but after travelling further south and rounding a promontory we reached a more congenial coastline that reminded us of Bulwar, our former home in the east. Now that we have found a suitable place to establish our first settlement, our people can begin to build their new life while the Exemplars survey these unknown lands, which diverge from all charts we have preserved from our ancestors."

 rezankand_founding_of_jaherdin_title:0 "The Founding of Jaherdin" #Jeck
 rezankand_founding_of_jaherdin_desc:0 "What was only some years ago a hastily erected settlement to house our people who were weary from the long journey, has now turned into a proper city. Jaherdin, as it is called in honor of both Jaher ta'Diranhriá and the Exemplar Jaherion before him, has become the beating heart of our burgeoning realm, from where exemplars and ordinary citizens alike strive to turn these wild lands into a new garden worthy of Surael’s blessing. Shaping our first city on these new shores into a worthy seat of our government of course requires substantial investments, such as erecting a central bazaar, building an artisan’s quarter, and, most importantly, raising up the first temple of Surael in Zenzarkand to provide the faithful with a place of worship."

 rezankand_dry_coast_league_title:0 "The Dry Coast League" #Jeck
 rezankand_dry_coast_league_desc:0 "Our people have spread out all along the Dry Coast, turning what was once an arid wasteland only sparsely inhabited by nomadic ruinborn into a prosperous land of proud city states. While our lands are united in faith, heritage and purpose, and warded by the ever vigilant exemplars, our many new towns and cities are free to see to their own affairs. By establishing the Dry Coast League, we have joined the many proud cities of ours together into a loose confederation. Thus we have created a forum to solve conflicts between settlements peacefully, foster further cooperation for the benefit of all and present a united front to all outsiders, be they the ruinborn states to the west or the cannorian settlers coming from the east."

 rezankand_land_of_sunlight_title:0 "Land of Sunlight" #Jeck
 rezankand_land_of_sunlight_desc:0 "Wherever one travels along the Dry Coast, be it the far west in the shadow of the snow-covered Katalmarai and Sikarha mountains beyond which the lands of Taychend lie, the far east, where the imposing Dazinseara mountains form the very tip of the Lai peninsula and the waters of the Radiant Straits swirl along the coastal desert, or inland in the foothills of the rugged Muraqata mountains that keep the northern jungle at bay, one encounters the presence of the devout. Pioneering settlements taming the land, prosperous villages tilling the ground and shining cities full of remarkable artistry have been raised from the ground by our people in the name of Surael.\n\nHere elves, both ruinborn and descended from the remnant fleet, as well as humans and harpies, having followed the exemplar’s lead and accompanied us from Bulwar all the way to these shores, live a harmonious and devout existence under His Light. It is clear that the time of disjointed city states only loosely linked by the Dry Coast League has passed. Now, what in essence has already become one united realm guided by the gentle but firm hand of the Order of Exemplars shall be formally united into Rezankand, the Land of Sunlight!"

 rezankand_sixth_age_of_the_sea_desc:0 "The people of Annail have been intrepid seafarers and adventurous explorers since antiquity. And their adventuring spirit has not diminished over time. With the discovery of unclaimed lands all along the Dry Coast many have been inspired to seek out a new home beyond the horizon. We welcome them as fellow adherents of the Sar-Arukanaš, the Devotion to the Light, eager to claim these lands for Surael. Whether they are human or harpy, all fellow believers are welcome to join us in bringing Surael’s truth to these shores."

 rezankand_city_of_light_title:0 "The City of Light" #Jeck
 rezankand_city_of_light_desc:0 "It is never easy to start anew, building a new home far from the old, but our tireless efforts have borne fruit and Rezankaz has truly earned the title ‘City of Light’, becoming a shining beacon of His Light on these shores. Its gilded palaces and verdant gardens are equal to those found in our old home back east, a worthy seat of our government and the incandescent beacon of light that will drive the Darkness from these benighted lands."

 rezankand_new_exemplars_title:0 "New Exemplars" #Jeck
 rezankand_new_exemplars_desc:0 "Just as the old Order of Exemplars arose from the Surnabari temple guards in response to the example set by Jaher and valiantly fought against all manifestations of the Malevolent Darkness lurking in Bulwar, our new homeland here in Zenzarkand requires a new kind of Exemplar, who will tirelessly struggle against the manifold forces of Darkness keeping its inhabitants from experiencing the grace of Surael’s Light. They shall be the sword and shield of our realm, protecting not only our own, but all our ruinborn brothers and sisters who yearn to be sheltered under His Light."
 
 rezankand_our_long_lost_brothers_title:0 "Our Long Lost Brothers" #Jeck
 rezankand_our_long_lost_brothers_desc:0 "The ancestors of the Sun Elves who fled towards Bulwar aboard the remnant fleet were but a fraction of the myriad denizens of the Precursor Empire. While many amongst our kind had feared that the Ruin which shattered Zenzarkand also meant the end for all elfkind except those lucky few who managed to flee in time, this has fortunately proven not to be the case. While far removed from their former heights during the age of the Precursors, the nomadic Oono’i roaming the arid lands of the Dry Coast are none other than the descendants of those of our kin that were left behind. We shall greet them with open arms and invite our long lost brethren to join us in our sacred mission."

 rezankand_troll_elves_title:0 "Troll-elves" #Jeck
 rezankand_troll_elves_desc:0 "The fell sorcery that caused the cataclysmic Ruin has not only shattered the lands of Zenzarkand, but it has also twisted the forms of its surviving inhabitants. Beyond the steep hills and forbidding mountains that separate the Dry Coast from the rest of southern Zenzarkand lies a vast sweltering expanse of untamed jungle, seemingly left pristine and untouched by civilization of any kind. However, our intrepid explorers have encountered a new kind of Ruinborn elf that has made their home in the outer reaches of the jungle along the western border of the Dry Coast. Even if the bodies of these Lai'i, somewhat disparagingly described as ‘Troll-Elves’ for their impressive stature and fearsome strength, may display the dread touch of the Ruin more prominently than other Ruinborn, but they are nonetheless scions of elvenkind and thus heirs to Zenzarkand like the rest of us, and contain an inner divine spark just as deserving of receiving Suraels blessings."

 rezankand_a_severed_coast_title:0 "A Severed Coast" #Jeck
 rezankand_a_severed_coast_desc:0 "Sailing along the shores of Zenzarkand, our navigators were soon confronted with an undeniable truth: the cataclysm that led to the exodus of our ancestors must have been of an even greater magnitude than even the most pessimistic speculations had assumed. Over the last decades, our most erudite scholars have reluctantly agreed upon a most outlandish theory - the calamity behind the Day of Ashen Skies did not merely devastate our ancestral home, but shattered the land itself. Vast tracts of lands have become either submerged under the waves or turned into enormous islands miles and miles away from where our ancient maps predicted they should be found. Still, even with all these stunning changes forced upon the land and sea itself, we remain convinced that what is now called the Severed Coast is all that is left of the homeland of our sun elven ancestors."

 rezankand_vigil_title:0 "Vigil" #Jeck
 rezankand_vigil_desc:0 "Whenever a new stretch of land is tamed, barren patches turning into verdant fields, whenever a new temple of Surael is erected, the ziggurat proudly rising into the blue sky, whenever a frontier outpost grows into a thriving new city, the joy is tempered by the sombre reminder that these lands, our lands, once were the home of untold elves who suffered a grim fate in the aftermath of the Day of Ashen Skies. Only a minuscule fraction of the precursors once inhabiting these lands could escape that cataclysm with the remnant fleet. The ashes and bones of all those left behind are buried in the very earth we walk on. Something we were reminded of when a recent excavation in one of our new coastal settlements revealed ancient precursor ruins containing a mass grave. We shall never forget those who were left behind. We shall always honor the unfortunate kin of our ancestors."

 rezankand_memory_of_the_paragons_title:0 "In Memory of the Paragons" #Jeck
 rezankand_memory_of_the_paragons_desc:0 "Courage, Loyalty, Compassion, Duty, Integrity - these are just some of the many virtues exhibited by the Sundancer paragons. Those heroes of old held off the depraved slavers and their heinous minions at the cost of their lives. Sacrificing everything to ensure that the vessels which would shelter our elven ancestors during their journey to their new home in exile could safely set sail. The example these paragons have set inspired those who followed Jaher into the depths of an unknown continent without hesitation. Tales of their deeds spurred generations of exemplars to join the fight against the Dark in all its forms. And they are just as worthy of emulation now that we find ourselves back in the very lands where they fought and died. We shall strive to honor their memory in the name of Surael!"
 
 rezankand_exemplars_charge_title:0 "Exemplars' Charge" #Taka
 rezankand_exemplars_charge_desc:0 "Sometimes, from the chaos of Taychend, an exceptional individual arises who believes they can overcome the rest, become the ultimate warlord. They fight, conquer, hundreds of thousands die – even if they win, their realm never lasts more than a century. Erankar the Defiant was the last of these great failures – and now, we are near his home city. One last charge is all we need, and the agents of the Dark will be swept away. The Oren Nayiru is advancing too, however, with the memories of tyranny and enslavement in their eyes, and dreams of bloody vengeance in their hearts. We must be careful, lest the forces of disorder tarnish order’s final victory."

 rezankand_the_infinite_cycle_title:0 "The Infinite Cycle" #Taka
 rezankand_the_infinite_cycle_desc:0 "To the Taychendi, the world is formed from a great many cycles. Night and day, storm season and dry, death and rebirth, love… and rise and fall. Of civilisations, peoples… and the world. They believe there has been five “Great Cycles” – periods of alternating chaos and order, where a different group ruled all. The storm-serpents, the gods, the dragons, the Slaver-Nobles – and the warlords. An era of chaos, ambition, striving for more. But still, they believed the Cycle of Glory would one day end.\n\nAnd now, it has – the Cycle of Dawn, as the Oren Nayiru call it, has arrived. And under the light of Rezankand, by the sword of Light and the blood of the Exemplars, this cycle shall not turn again!"

 rezankand_dazinare_title:0 "Dazinare" #Jeck
 rezankand_dazinare_desc:0 "Untold secrets of past ages slumber beneath the ground of Zenzarkand, only to unexpectedly surface every now and then. The growth of our new settlement in Gladeshire has led to such an unexpected discovery. While digging out the foundations for the new main temple of the town, ruins of an ancient precursor city have been found. Subsequent excavations have unearthed a veritable treasure trove of precursor artefacts. After studying the relics our scholars have come to the conclusion that this ancient precursor settlement was none other than Dazinare, the home port of the Diranhriá and the place the sun elven remnant fleet set sail from towards safer shores during the Ruin of Aelantir!"

 rezankand_choosing_sides_title:0 "Choosing Sides" #Taka
 rezankand_choosing_sides_desc:0 "We first encountered the Oren Nayiru in our initial expedition to Taychend. A native Taychendi slave and peasant movement had taken our arrival as the sign of a new age, Surael equated to the “Last Elusive One”, Nayiru. The theology is mangled, but the ideas are there. The Oren Nayiru, like us, believe in the abolition of slavery, the ending of tyranny – but they are… chaotic. Every “cell”, or chapter, has their own traditions, and the tenets and beliefs of the faith seem to be constantly changing, evolving, becoming more radical or conservative at random. And they seem to be far more bloodthirsty than many Exemplars are comfortable with. Certainly born of Taychend – and there are some among us who are very wary of that indeed. Perhaps we need to think carefully about our relationship to them?"

 rezankand_marching_west_title:0 "Marching West" #Taka
 rezankand_marching_west_desc:0 "Ameion says that they are on the side of order. They say they are against slavery. They even have the gall to claim that we are a “foreign invader”, that we deserted Taychend after the Ruin, that we have no right to interfere! But their serfdom is simply slavery under another name. They are not content to correct the ways of the Taychendi, banish the darkness from their lands as we do – instead, they obliterate their native culture, their traditions! The Taychendi fill our ranks and join our noble cause of their own will – their own “Klereyen” have clearly been coerced and cajoled into abandoning their old ways! The time has come to prove that we are the only hope for Aelantir, and save the land from their blight for good."

 rezankand_selfish_reasons_title:0 "Selfish Reasons" #Jeck
 rezankand_selfish_reasons_desc:0 "The Malevolent Dark touched all aspects of precursor society and ultimately led to its downfall. Thus elf enslaved elf, a truly abhorrent practice born from the depraved minds of those lost to the Dark. But not everyone was lost in those dark days. For every villainous scourge spreading darkness, a courageous hero was struggling to bring forth a ray of light. And Munakles, or Munazhlan the Chain-Breaker as he is called by the descendants of his followers, was one of the greatest of these heroes. He liberated slaves all over Taychend and led them far away from their oppressors into their new homeland in the lush Mteibhas valley, carrying with them many relic treasures of their former masters. Their descendants, the Mteibhar and Chendhyans, still adhere to the teachings of Munakles, and are thus more receptive to our message of freedom for all under the Light of Surael than most other ruinborn. We only stand to gain from convincing our fiercely independent brethren to join us in the liberation of all of Zenzarkand. And who knows, maybe they might express their gratitude by sharing some of the treasures of their precursor ancestors with us…"

 rezankand_salvation_title:0 "Salvation" #Jeck
 rezankand_salvation_desc:0 "The Light of Surael touches all. This simple but undeniable truth lies behind our unceasing effort to bring His Light to all the various peoples of Zenzarkand. From the war torn lands of the Taychendi to the prideful city states of the Kheionai, from the vast savannas and secluded mountain strongholds of the Devandi to the tempestuous lands of the Amadians, and even to those unfortunates dwelling within the benighted jungle realm, our people have gone and reached out to grant the elves of these lands the gift of Surael's Light. Now that all of fractious Alecand is united under our firm but benevolent aegis, the Kheionai have joined their kin on the mainland as wards of Surael. All ruinborn in Zenzarkand, be they Kheionai or other, inhabiting these lands under our protection are safe from the predations of the Malevolent Dark and its agents. It is our sacred duty to protect those under our care and ensure that they are free to lead an existence basking in His Light and can devote themselves to do their part in the eternal Struggle, liberating others in turn."

 rezankand_the_exemplars_return_title:0 "Exemplars' Return" #Taka
 rezankand_the_exemplars_return_desc:0 "When we began our first expedition into Taychend, we did all that we could to vanquish the agents of darkness that had infected the region – but the Taychendi misunderstood our intentions, believing us to be “interlopers”, base conquerors interested only in relics and power. We did not have the strength to convince them otherwise, establish a lasting peace in the region – but now, things have changed. When we march over the Katalmarai once more, the slaves will be freed, the grim cycle of violence will be ended, and the darkness banished at last. Beware, warlords, slavers, so-called-order-bringers – for the Exemplars have returned!"

 rezankand_unsealing_the_past_title:0 "Unsealing the Past" #Taka
 rezankand_unsealing_the_past_desc:0 "The insidious and megalomaniacal Slaver-Nobles that once ruled Taychend were mages of immeasurable power, and, through the artefacts they left behind, mages may wield a fraction of this might. Wielded by warlords to maintain the vicious cycle of violence that has gripped Taychend since the Ruin, these relics – whether they lie still within the monolithic ruins of the Precursors or are kept in the armouries, palaces and temples of the Taychendi – can and must be turned to a greater purpose. It is time to unseal and past, unravel the secrets of the Slaver-Nobles, and turn their power to a new, righteous cause."

 rezankand_the_herald_of_legacy_title:0 "The Herald Of Legacy" #Jeck
 rezankand_the_herald_of_legacy_desc:0 "The Precursors ruling Zenzarkand were powerful beyond measure, but they were left adrift without the Light of Surael in their hearts. Their evil deeds are part of our history, just as the heroic feats of those that resisted the Slaver-Nobles have inspired our people since the times of the remnant fleet. It is not just our legacy, but our sacred duty, to ensure that the relics left from the time of the Precursor Empire are kept safe from the wrong hands, turning these dangerous artefacts from weapons of the Dark into tools of the Light. Our most talented Kurešimi mages, engineers and artificers have formed the order of Sundancers under the Herald of Legacy, safeguarding the remnants of the past and using them to further the sacred Order of Surael. Based out of the Diranhriá, itself one of our greatest relics, they shall work tirelessly to turn our dark past into a bright future."

 rezankand_diranhria_degarikes_title:0 "Diranhriá Degárikes" #Jeck
 rezankand_diranhria_degarikes_desc:0 "The mighty Degárikes, the pinnacle of Kheionai naval engineering, ensured the dominance of Kheionai fleets over all rival naval powers before our arrival. But our shipwrights and sailors who built and crewed vessels capable of crossing oceans are more than up to the challenge. We shall not be outdone by would-be thalassocracies who remain limited to navigating close to their home shores. With the collected knowledge of millennia of Bulwari shipbuilding, the knowledge gained from studying precursor vessels, the Diranhriá first among them, and the ingenuity of practitioners of our Kurešim, the art of inscription which some Cannorians consider proto-artificery, our fleets shall best everyone, even the prideful Kheionai, who dare contest our control over the seas around our new home."

 rezankand_the_tower_title:0 "The Tower" #Jeck
 rezankand_the_tower_desc:0 "The many decades of our campaign against the evil infesting the jungle expanse bordering Rezankand are finally over. The Gallu at the heart of this vast web of darkness has been vanquished, and once more forces of Light are triumphant in the eternal Struggle against the Dark.\n\nIt now falls upon us to ensure that the Darkness may never again gain a foothold in these lands, and begin the preparations to continue our Struggle against the Dark in the rest of Zenzarkand.\n\nOur Herald of Legacy has approached us with a bold proposal - creating an enormous artificery device unlike anything the world has ever seen. A massive tower erected on the site of our great victory, a great power node in the center of the continent, combining the knowledge gleaned from our precursor ancestors and the many disparate traditions both native to our new home and brought with us from Bulwar. This shall become the lynchpin linking together a sacred web of light encompassing all of Zenzarkand."

 rezankand_architects_of_the_future_title:0 "Architects of the Future" #Taka
 rezankand_architects_of_the_future_desc:0 "The Taychendi have always had a fascination with the relics of power that fill their homeland. Nagar Vyechei’s enigmatic Blue House have spent a millennium studying the enchantments that permeate them, but they only care for mages. In Royakottar, the Vustarin Family, with their non-mage footsoldiers in mind, have taken a different approach – replication… and in a way that creates objects usable by all. Karodir and the others have taken an interest in this, and have worked alongside the (defanged and sufficiently chastened) Vustarin to try and synthesise Sun Elven, Bulwari and Taychendi methods of magical production.\n\nTheir first joint-creation is the Light-Matrix, a network of Precursor steel spell-casters, inscribed in the Bulwari style and powered by damestear – without need for mages, they can safely teleport messages between other installations in their network. Expensive to build, even more so to maintain, but they are an important step in fully realizing the potential of this land – and the potential of all who wish to answer Surael’s call, and become his Chosen. Let us make this dream reality."

 rezankand_whispers_of_doom_desc:0 "Brooding and vast, the Effelai jungle lies like a suffocating corpse veil over much of Zenzarkand, burying the remains of precursor civilisation under the unchecked growth of its green mass. While the deep-rooted dread with which the Oono’i of the Dry Coast regard this vast verdant realm has initially been discarded as superstitious folly, even the most battle-hardened Exemplar cannot deny the pervasive unease taking hold of them soon after they begin to move beneath its gloomy canopy. Some even whisper that it is the jungle itself that is aware of every intruder and seeks to either expel or consume them."

 rezankand_an_elf_of_extremes_title:0 "An Elf of Extremes" #Jeck
 rezankand_an_elf_of_extremes_desc:0 "The existential dread felt by those living in the viridescent shadow of the Effelai for generation after generation is something that can only be imagined but never truly felt by outsiders. And while others might not grasp the depth of despair and helplessness felt by those seeing their loved ones snatched away by seedthralls and even worse, becoming seedthralls in turn, they can surely comprehend how such a history of unrelenting hostility might ignite a profound hatred for all things Effelai in those surviving its depredations.\n\nOne such individual is Idras, a imposing Exemplar born from a dawn elf father and a Lai’i mother, who lost both her parents to the voracious appetite of the blooming jungle. She has welded a ragtag group of dawn elves of Lai’i and Oono’i descent, united only by having suffered the same fate of losing their families to the seedthralls, into a new holy order, the Order of Avengers. Their mission, sanctioned by Ecaris himself, is to fend off seedthrall raids and raid the jungle in turn, always searching for the roots of the malignant entity holding sway over the inimical jungle. Idras herself has been proclaimed Herald of Vengeance, and was entrusted with the wishblade Zalagnur to carry out her holy mission."

 rezankand_purification_title:0 "Purification" #Jeck
 rezankand_purification_desc:0 "A constant nightmare of screeching seedthralls, treacherous vines and poisonous thorns has harassed our brave Avengers every step of the way during their methodical purge of the Effelai, cleansing its vast expanse of the deep-rooted evil infesting it. But finally they have reached the heart of darkness, an overgrown ruin city permeated with a cancerous vitality and a malignant intelligence at its core. This must be where the infestation first took hold over the verdant lands of tropical Zenzarkand. It is here where we shall bring an end to this malign creature, this insatiable Herald of the Malevolent Dark. Surael’s sacred fire must burn out every last trace of this affront to His Order, and we have the fitting instrument to execute His Will - the Phoenix shall rise above Anwohi’i and rain down judgment over the vile servant of the Dark entrenched there!"

 rezankand_aim_for_the_sun_title:0 "Aim for the Sun" #Jeck
 rezankand_aim_for_the_sun_desc:0 "’Aim for the Sun’ is the motto of the White Phoenix house of wisdom. Founded by Karodir Varamzuir, the former ruler of Varamhar and most accomplished mage of his generation, is the undisputed center of magical learning in all of Rezankand. After the tragedy at Samartal and the inexorable advance of the disciples of Jaddar led to the collapse of sun elven rule in Bulwar, he joined the Exemplar’s expedition not just to flee the collapse of his former realm, but to discover firsthand the arcane secrets left behind by the Precursors, a goal he would dedicate his remaining life to. He and his acolytes in the White Phoenix house of wisdom have shown a remarkable aptitude of melding the ancient magical arts of Bulwar with the various esoteric practices that arose amongst the Ruinborn after the Day of Ashen Skies. And by this, together with whatever fragments of the even more venerable arcane wisdom of the Precursors could be uncovered, they have created astonishing feats of magic whose brilliance is almost as bright as the very sun."

 rezankand_a_matter_of_perspective_title:0 "A Matter of  Perspective" #Jeck
 rezankand_a_matter_of_perspective_desc:0 "The Ereš workings of Bulwar, the magical schools of Cannor, the ways of chi manipulation of Haless and countless other arcane traditions all fundamentally share the same foundational principle and goal - controlling an ineffable power to force the will of the mage onto an unsuspecting reality. Once this fundamental truth has been internalised, sufficiently skilled and learned mages might weave strands of disparate magical traditions into a new tapestry of esoteric marvels.\n\nTaking something like the storied Zamukaraš of Bulwar, magic carpets and flying battle platforms, and powering the construct by a damestear core designed along precursor principles to create a truly enormous flying vehicle is only the most prominent example of this approach to magical research favored by the houses of wisdom in Rezankand. The only fitting name for such an awe-inspiring sorcerous marvel is of course the phoenix, capable of transporting not just a couple of passengers but scores of battlemages and raining sorcerous fire on all enemies below."

 rezankand_the_growing_shadow_desc:0 "What had once only been considered an assortment of old wives' tales and cautionary stories intended to keep curious children away from the dangers of the uncharted jungle, has, to our dismay, proven to be all too real. The jungle has unmistakably demonstrated that it does not appreciate our attempts to bring Surael’s gifts of light and civilisation into its depths.\n\nIsolated incidents, easily discarded as the product of an overactive imagination have become a massed assault on our outposts in the jungle. Creatures called Seedthralls, appearing elven in origin but infested with vines and incapable of being reasoned with, have begun to swarm out of the deep reaches of the jungle. Their assaults show clear signs of an overarching intelligence capable of coordinating attacks across hundreds of miles, a shared mind obviously in service of the Dark and attempting to extinguish Surael’s Light on these shores. In the face of this new existential threat we are forced to muster all our ingenuity to counter this strategic advantage if we do not want to risk being overrun."

The oldest tales of the Bulwari, our stalwart brethren across the ocean, tell of the Tirdina, or Dark Forest, that in time immemorial covered much of what is now the austere Salahad desert. Now seemingly devoid of life, but back then thriving with all manners of plants, animals and, crucially, monsters rejecting Surael’s gift of Civilisation and preying upon the distant ancestors of today’s Bulwari.\n\nAnd as it was back then, so it is now. Hidden in utter darkness, deep in the center of the jungle, is a malignant entity, a Gallu, or demon. In Bulwar it was Šaksu, the vile remnant of the nature deity Amaštu corrupted by the Malevolent Dark, in Zenzarkand it is the Effelai itself, infested with a malignant awareness of its own. But in both cases Surael has given us the gift to deal with such threats - blessed fire, chasing away the darkness and thus purifying the land and all it contains."

But beyond the deadly desert of the Khaydhano lies a mysterious land called Hinedíu Yulas by its inhabitants, while Cannorian explorers have chosen the name Amadia for it.\n\nThere, the land itself is infused with magic; wild, uncontrollable, dangerous, yet magnificent magic. Probably the richest source of Sahabaš, more commonly known as Damestear, in all of Zenzarkand, this land has caught the attention of the Herald of Legacy and his Kurešimi, who have suggested Amadia as the ideal testing ground for some of their more ambitious designs. The naturally occurring Sahabaš amplifies the wild magic coursing through these lands, so they propose to use the art of inscription to channel its abundant energy into a stable matrix allowing for reliable and predictable outcomes, like a raging river is tamed by a network of dikes and reservoirs – though the Amadians will need to be convinced of the benefits of our plans, we are sure they will accept it eventually.

The slave trade arriving in tow of the colonisation of northern Zenzarkand in particular, is clearly an instrument of the Dark to spread suffering and disrupt the Order of Surael.\n\nIt was thus nothing less than our divine duty to bring these diverse lands under our aegis and turn all of Zenzarkand into Elrezan, the Home of Sunlight!"

Slavery – and from our numerous in depth discussions with those slaves, it seems to take many intractable forms – is rampant, and they say that the Taychendi fight constant ritual battles, “Periyodhai”, amongst themselves, a constant exposure to violence that continues even when one of their transitory empires arises. They make excuse after excuse, but even as they speak of how the elation of battle-victory is shared by all, of brilliant tales of heroes and villains and epic struggles, we can see the truth. Since the Ruin, Taychend has been captured by the Malevolent Dark.\n\nBeyond this ‘Taychend’, the Taychendi have talked of an assortment of bloodthirsty and chaos-loving nomadic raiders, and even further, at the edge of the continent, a host of godless city states, ruled by avaricious merchants, petty aristocrats or ruthless career soldiers. Though these “Kheionai” profess to follow order, tales of their great naval wars and constant squabbling amongst each other in the ephemeral chase for fleeting hegemony abound – and one of their number, the one they call "Laskaris", has even in recent times conquered deep into Taychend.\n\nWe did not expect to come here as conquerors – but it has become clear to Ecaris and his council that this land is in the grip of the Malevolent Dark. We have tried talking sense to them – but they do not listen, and have begun to call us “Interlopers” behind our backs. How could we abandon these people, when they seem incapable of saving themselves? We are Exemplars – it is our divinely ordained duty to bring Suraels Light to Zenzarkand and chase the Darkness from these shores!"

Nanru Nakar’s undercity had been wondrous, a titanic warren of passages, cavernous warehouses, underground bunks for slaves. What the Precursors lacked in morality, they made up for in sheer, magnificent power. Karodir knew the folly of seeking that trade. But he pushed his dreams of rekindled hearts and rejuvenated divinity aside – and grimaced as he took stock of reality. “It’s not enough.”\n\nThe Exemplar commander beside him sighed. “We’ve been down here for weeks, and it’s not enough? Even if we deny the Mudaliars’ share–!”\n“We’ll deny them. It’s still not enough.” Karodir grumbled as he checked the assembled relics. “We need more spell focuses to repair the evokers, more precursor steel for capacity, encased damestear for the conduits. No… its not enough. We’ll need to take from the Nakari. And we’ll need to take a lot.”\n\n“The temples.” Another of the Exemplars said. “So we’ll just walk in, storm the reliquaries, and take them?” Karodir rubbed at his chin. It was enticing. But the Taychendi held to their gods well – and their temples were sacred ground, the Precursor relics held there used by the heroes they worshipped, given out only to those who emulated them, patronised their cults. The Exemplars could do so – give gold, other rewards, certain liberties. Or they could try to… “scorn” them. He’d heard precedent of it. The Taychendi felt some god-heroes too evil for worship, suppressed their cults. Yodhan, Valkadevu, Ebenanth… violent, easy to convince Ecaris to outlaw them, get some of the Taychendi, at least, to go along with it – but the gods of the Mudaliars? It would take effort… but could yield fruit, down the line.\n\nOr they could just storm the temples, take what they need. Violate their sanctity, take without recourse. But didn’t they need them more than the Taychendi, really? Couldn’t the Exemplars be trusted more? Didn’t these trinkets not really matter, in the end?

Many of the new arrivals hail from Bahar, Brasan, Annail and the other Bulwari islands of the Divenhal, suffused with a pioneering spirit that would make their ancestors proud. Many amongst their number have chosen to adopt the moniker ‘new Ayabnati’ in honor of the enduring culture of their home islands whose inhabitants already bravely ventured into the unknown in search of new opportunities during the time of ancient Bulwar.\n\nBy now, enough new settlers have arrived to establish a couple of new colonies along the Dry Coast.

With the foundation of Rezankand, the diverse inhabitants of the Dry Coast, both newcomers from the east and those born in these lands, have demonstrated their unwavering conviction to become a radiant beacon of light on a continent shrouded in darkness. Not merely a motley collection of independent statelets, but a strong and unified realm devoted to lead the many inhabitants of Zenzarkand towards His Light.\nA new realm born from the unique blend of Bulwari and Zenzarkandi influences requires a faith equally suited for its unique circumstances. Thus, a new council gathering representatives of all temples of the Sar-Arukanaš, the Devotion to the Light, and all holy orders within Rezankand has been called upon to decide the future of the faith.\nAfter many days and nights of vigorous debate between proponents of the many disparate visions for and traditions within the faith, a new set of dogmatic tenets has been agreed upon at the Council of Jaherdin, binding the many autocephalous temples together with a shared doctrine.\nFirstly, no longer shall Chosenhood be considered the birthright of all Sun Elves - instead, Chosenhood is granted by Surael to a few exalted individuals, irrespective of their race. These chosen Exemplars are tasked with protecting the faithful children of Surael and directing the fight against the Malevolent Dark. In some ways this marks a more progressive approach as Chosenhood is no longer contingent upon an individual’s racial heritage but in principle open to all, similar to the belief espoused by the Way of Jaddar, yet it also harkens back to ancient times, where the title of Gumar, or Chosen One, was granted only to those select few who distinguished themselves through legendary feats in service of Surael.\nThus, only those who feel the calling of Surael and have demonstrated they have been gifted the needed talents by Him shall ascend to the rank of Exemplar, taking on the burden of devoting their life to the Struggle against the Dark, and lead the people as paragons of the Light.\nSecondly, all elves, be they Sun Elves, Ruinborn, or other, are in truth children of Surael just like the Bulwari. Their very essence is infused by the sacred Ilu of Surael, a reward for their centuries of unwavering dedication to the cause of Light.

As they say, hindsight is always easier than foresight, but for all the good intentions that went into the conception of Project Divinity, it turned out that it was never truly needed. The people of Bulwar never needed an artificial godling to bolster their faith after decades of internecine warfare between the sun elven Chosen, all it took was a fiery prophet charging out of the desert with an inner fire lit by Surael Himself - or at least that was the claim made by Jaddar.\nAs soon as he heard of the fall of Sareyand, he knew which way the wind was blowing, and Karodir has always prided himself to be, amongst his many other qualities, a survivor. Instead of letting the desert wind bury him beneath the sands of time, he chose to join the venture of similarly farsighted Ecaris, who saw the writing on the wall as well, and donated what resources his kingdom could spare to the expedition, himself and his loyal cadre of students foremost among them.\nBack then he might not have realised it himself, but this course of events was clearly the Will of Surael, for only by travelling to these distant shores could he finally discover his true purpose as a scholar, a mage and a devout follower of Surael.

By applying a seemingly purely ornamental Precursor trinket acquired during our time in Taychend to an inconspicuous lock in the armory of the Diranhriá, one of our Kurešimi recently managed to unseal a compartment hidden from view since before the Day of Ashen Skies.\n\nWithin it lay a veritable treasure, the armor of Paragon Allannia herself! It is not only an invaluable historical artifact, connecting us with one of the heroes of our distant past, but also an extraordinary example of Precursor craftsmanship.\n\nAfter considerable effort and many abortive attempts, Karodir, our Herald of Legacy, and his disciples have managed to decipher many, if not all, secrets of its construction.

The riotous coloration of the jungle plants, the myriad fragrances wafting in the humid air, and the strangely harmonious cacophony of birdsong and animal noises echoing from deep within this verdant labyrinth.\nHis lack of antipathy was likely one of the major contributors to his success as a šamqissu trader, providing the plantations set up in the outskirts of the vast jungle with all the amenities only found on the civilised shores of the Dry Coast in return for their harvest of the precious šamqissu herb. Steeped in hot water and then traditionally served in a gourd, the herb leaves were the basis for the wildly popular Qišu drink that had largely replaced tea or coffee as the drink of choice in Rezankand.\nTriandil had undertaken this current trip many times before, and the horses of his small caravan found the path almost on their own. And yet, with each passing moment a strange unease rose within him. At first, he was tempted to discard it as mere superstitious folly, but with the usually so boisterous jungle fallen strangely quiet, a terrible sense of dread began to pervade his every thought.\nWhen finally his wagon passed the final turn and the plantation lay before him, he exhaled a deep sigh and allowed himself a moment of hope that his apprehension was unfounded. Yet as the moments passed on their approach to the main buildings of the plantation, he was keenly aware that no worker tended the fields, no overseer came forward to greet them.\nAt the gates of the main courtyard, he bade his wagoners to stop and continued onwards on foot with only a handful of his caravan guards. Stepping into the main courtyard, the mystery of the missing plantation workers was solved, but Triandil would have gladly chosen ignorance over the sight that greeted him. A pile of dismembered and decomposing corpses, with many appearing as if half-devoured, mixed with the remains of the livestock was all that was left of a once thriving plantation community.\nThe next hours and days only left tenuous marks on his memory - scattered impressions of a breakneck flight, of eerily rhythmical noises chasing them out of the jungle, and - worst of all - of the corpses infiltrated by green tendrils starting to twitch at his hesitant approach."

The Exemplars would not harm them. But for the Oren Nayiru, “we have a right to justice! To deal unto them what they have done to us!”\n\nThe commander grimaced. “That is not justice, Kavalal! That is revenge! All to suit your own desires– not do what is right!” The Kavalal put a hand on his hilt. “Our own desires? Is that what you say?! We have shed just as much blood as you have to take this city– and for a century before that, our blood has been shed by Urvand’s hands! But, oh, back in Bulwar I am sure that you all make nice when murder is done– sweet words and reconciliations!

Once there, it was a simple matter of planting the Inscripted sunburst containers and triggering their activation sequence.

The long and arduous struggles, the triumphant victory against all odds, and the eventual glorious return to Bulwar.\nFinally he spotted his destination, Sarnagir’s palace glittering atop the mountain peak like a titanic diamond glowing in the light of dawn.

Wandering through its many halls, he encountered other beings like himself, pious warriors of Surael, transformed into beings of living flame in service of the Light.

For a devout champion of Surael, there is a way to serve the light even from beyond death’s door.

By swearing a sacred oath to serve the light until their mission is fulfilled, if need be even beyond death, a holy warrior may bind his inner light, his Ilu, to Sarnagir. Should such a warrior perish in the pursuit of duty, his body will be clad in an Inscripted bronze armor and the Kašipti will invoke Sarnagir’s blessing. If successful, the corpse will instantly ignite into flames and the warrior spirit will become an Išizalagar - ‘One who is in Flames’ - a being of living flame contained and nourished by the armor, who may continue on this plane of existence as long as their mission is not yet fulfilled.\nAnd this is what Ecaris has long since prepared for. With his untimely death before the fulfillment of his oath, the exorcist-priests have begun the Išizalagar rite, and, as is to be expected from such a devout servant of Surael, Ecaris was soon reborn in flames, rising from the ashes of his old existence to serve his holy purpose once again."

Though this has been common to Taychend in some periods and areas, the Oren Nayiru claim we are only implementing it so widely because of how similar it is to the way land is organised in Bulwar.\n\nClearly, this is ridiculous – but the Oren Nayiru are insistent that we pull this mode of ownership back from their lands, and depose several disliked Vaikazelhi nobles. Doing so will placate them greatly, but at what cost to our efforts to impose order on Taychend?"

Their violent fervor may prove quite disruptive for the entire region, however, and we must keep a close eye on the changes they may engender."

 exemplar_state_desc:0 "The state is ruled by the Holy Orders, with the Council of Heralds under the Herald of Light at its apex. Most internal affairs and low-level administrative tasks are managed by the governing bodies of the individual city states, with the Holy Orders acting as impartial arbitrators and overseers, but all fundamental policy decisions, particularly those regarding military and foreign policy, are dictated by the Herald of Light."

 mission_of_exemplary_desc:0 "The Duty of the Exemplars is to serve as examples of righteousness to all the people under their sway, especially if they do not yet have let the Light of Surael into their hearts and minds and still cling to their misguided superstitions or agnostic delusions. Even they shall, in due time, find their way to the truth, while we protect them from harm. Our virtuous conduct shall speak more eloquently of the rectitude of our cause than any proselytizing prayer can hope to be."

 artifice_invention_rezankand_phoenix_desc:0 "Developed by the Kurešimi Artificers by combining Precursor and Bulwari knowledge, the Phoenix is a new take on the traditional Bulwari flying platform. Thanks to their core, based on the one in the Diranhriá, the Phoenix can move almost at the same speed as a magic carpet, without sacrificing the barriers and structure of the flying platforms; and more importantly, the core allows the Phoenix to function without a mage, removing the main limitation of the Zamukaraš."

 artifice_invention_sunplate_armors_desc:0 "‘Sunplate’, based on the rediscovered armour of the Paragon Allaria, and created by inscribing magically infused steel, Sunplate is a lightweight, flexible but very resistant magical armor, which takes on the appearance of a pale gold, glistening metal, engraved with the dark blue of lapis lazuli, mined from Caiyamkq and imported from Bulwar – when the plate is struck, these lapis inscriptions glow bright blue, and besides that can be enchanted on the fly by a close-combat mage through the addition of damestear conduits."

 artifice_invention_light_matrix_supply_desc:0 "The Sar-Areš, or Light-Matrix, is a network of Precursor steel spell-casters, inscribed in the Bulwari style and powered by damestear – without need for mages, they can safely teleport items between other installations in their network. Expensive to build, even more so to maintain and use, when employed on a large-enough scale their use could greatly help the provision of supplies to our forces."

Expensive to build, even more so to maintain and use, on a large-enough scale they can be used to greatly enhance our logistical capabilities, keeping track of units and supply situations via messages, sending requisitioned items when needed, and helping to secure items and relics of high importance."

 artifice_invention_rezankand_colossus_desc:0 "Inspired by the discoveries made in Cannor and our own experimentation, the Colossus, like the Phoenix, is based on the Flying Platforms, however, it replaces speed and elevation with a bigger size, stronger barriers and a long-range frontal cannon able to channel a beam of sunfire. Our Colossus hover 10 metres over the battlefield, inspiring fear on the servants of the Dark, and purifying the land of our forefathers with Surael’s holy Light."
