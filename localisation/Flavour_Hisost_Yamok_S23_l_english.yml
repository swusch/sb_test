 S23_show_no_weakness_title:0 "Show No Weakness"
 S23_show_no_weakness_desc:0 "Blood splattered in the royal apartments, split throats in sleeping beds. The Raheni have no honour, no dignity! Our nation weeps for our murdered royals and our poor young Seble, but we must hold strong. Even now the dogs of Prukhakin look south, seeking, probing, searching for weakness - to see us fall, as the entire Ofehibi coast has fallen already.\n\nWe will not let them.\n\nWe must rally behind our young Queen and cast these pirates back into the ocean which birthed them, a message for every scion of Rahen. Hisost Yamok shall not fall!"

 S23_gnollish_frontier_title:0 "The Gnollish Frontier"
 S23_gnollish_frontier_desc:0 "With the present threat dealt with, our gaze must turn west. Fieldstalker gnolls have long been our friends here beyond the Keygas, but the rising tribe of Haraagtseda is another story entirely. Already they sniff and poke at our borders, seeking expansion much the same as the dogs of Rahen. They too shall know our resilience, but first we must see to those sympathetic to us. Many gnolls residing here in our Kingdom have pack and familial ties to those across the border. By leveraging their loyalty and connections, we can bolster our numbers and deplete Haraagtseda, leaving us strengthened and them weakened for the inevitable conflict to come."

 S23_expanding_the_realm_title:0 "Expanding the Realm"
 S23_expanding_the_realm_desc:0 "Since the very founding of our kingdom, we have driven the range of Amilak’s domain forwards, extending the light of his gaze beyond the realms river borders. Here we have settled, in peace with those gnolls who called our home theirs too.\n\nBut now the time for peace is past, and the time for conflict come - Haraagsteda cannot be allowed to sit as a vulture upon our flank for any longer. Sound the calls of war and let the Rhino ride! The western gnolls shall know another ruler’s hand, gentler and more able."

 S23_faith_in_the_faithless_land_title:0 "Faith in the Faithless Land"
 S23_faith_in_the_faithless_land_desc:0 "In Amilak’s benevolence, he assigned each of his chosen people a land to call their own, and a Sky-King to watch over them. Here though, beyond the borders of his realm, we exist outside that benevolence. It is our daily charge to push his will forth into the domain of the God-kin, to remind ourselves each day we serve him and him alone, now more than ever. To further this purpose we shall create a great temple in the capital, one that declares to all of Dreksaret our truth - here too is Madriamilak!"

 S23_the_exception_title:0 "The Exception?"
 S23_the_exception_desc:0 "Amilak is our god, and the greatest god, but that is not to say he is the only god. His many God-Kin hold dominion over lands outside his domain, and it is thus perhaps no surprise that our gnollish friends worship another than he. Kvanga is their goddess, they say, a patroness of the earth and forge, who forged gnolls from hyenas into beings capable of virtue.\n\nThis worship poses us a deep theological challenge. All Mengi should worship Amilak, and our gnolls ARE Mengi - but they rightfully worship a goddess in her own domain, a goddess of virtue. The Mezhi has tasked a council of our wisest Semayabaka to deliberate on this worship, and a conclusion has been reached: the Gnolls may worship Kvangahga, so long as they recognise Amilak also. Now it but remains to convince them thus."

 S23_darkness_on_the_doorstep_title:0 "Darkness on the Doorstep"
 S23_darkness_on_the_doorstep_desc:0 "We have been negligent. In our quest against evil, we have neglected the very heart of Yrilak’s will upon Halann, the foul and insidious darkness that seeps from his swamp.\n\nAs close as the other bank of the Keygas his tendrils spread. The lord of Simegasa, traitor of the soul that he is, made pact with Yrilak’s favoured servants - the Hags of Yezel Mora. To excise the darkness there is beyond us for now, but contain it we can."

 S23_demons_of_the_savannah_title:0 "Demons of the Savannah"
 S23_demons_of_the_savannah_desc:0 "To the west stretches the endless plain, a thing of beauty to some, yet tainted almost irrevocably by the sulfurous touch of the infernal. The Xhazobkult Gnolls pollute the land with their pyres and ash, the worship of their demonic masters. How awful it is, to revere a being that seeks only to consume, to aspire to nothing more than being a husk.\n\nWe faithful cannot abide this. Amilak’s wind pulls west, and his warriors follow."

 S23_queens_gambit_title:0 "The Queens Gambit"
 S23_queens_gambit_desc:0 "The Queen has hatched a plan, a brilliant and swift strike against the remaining Raheni colonies along the northern coastline. The sea is our advantage, even though we have little power there - infested with Raheni and Pirates as it is, it still presents a barrier to reinforcements from Rahen. By attacking all the Raghamideshi at once and defeating them decisively here in Sarhal, we can secure the coast against sea landings, forcing them to concede their colonies to us. We must be cautious, however; fail to secure the entire coast and we will inevitably drown in a renewed tide of their conquering savages."

 S23_suffer_no_heathen_title:0 "Suffer no Heathen"
 S23_suffer_no_heathen_desc:0 "With the Ofehibi coast and its people safely under our protection, our focus must turn inwards for a time. Rahen’s yoke was tight, and their rule has regrettably led many of the local Mengi away from Amilak’s grace. We do not blame them for losing faith; we know how hard it is here across the Keygas, let alone beneath the boot of the tiger lovers. No, we shall simply shepard them back to the truth, as gently - or as firmly - as required."

 S23_faithless_and_misguided_title:0 "The Faithless and Misguided"
 S23_faithless_and_misguided_desc:0 "Kvanga may be a virtuous god-kin of Amilak, but not all Gnolls are so favourably inclined in their worship. As our borders expand west, we come to face a much darker form of Gnollish worship, that of the infernal Xhaz. So far from Amilak’s light it is only natural to fall into darkness, but we cannot let these evils stand. We shall show them a new way, a better way, the way of earth and sky, so they may become Mengi too."

 S23_secure_our_future_title:0 "Secure Our Future"
 S23_secure_our_future_desc:0 "Our noble king and queen lay dead, and our hopes and dreams for the future rest upon the shoulders of young Princess Seble. She shall have great heights to climb to avenge her parents death, and will need all the help we can offer her. Tutors must be hired to nurture her great mind and tongue, and alliances made to hold back the Raheni predation until such a day as she is old enough to take the crown. On that day, her rage and drive will lead us on to the path to vengeance."

 S23_the_coronation_title:0 "The Coronation"
 S23_the_coronation_desc:0 "Let ring the bells of celebration, for a Mezhi is to be crowned! We shall prepare a ceremony, one more grand and ostentatious than ever held before, a statement of wealth and unity, one that will ring across the world. Only time will tell what our young Mezhi’s legacy will be, but for now our nation's hopes go with her. As she rises, so too does Hisost Yamok!"

 S23_route_to_rahen_title:0 "The Route to Rahen"
 S23_route_to_rahen_desc:0 "Justice demands an eye for an eye, but vengeance demands a continent for a king.\n\nThe Mezhi is not content with securing our borders, no. In her heart burns a rage so deep it would take an ocean to quench, and only one born from the blood of Rahen at that. So she is called away to war, and so we shall follow. We are no sailors, and cannot cross the waters of the gulf in force as our foe did, but Mezhi’s Indomitable will shall lead us on the road less traveled, around the coast and through the Salahad desert.\n\nWoe betide anyone who gets in our way."

 S23_colonial_comeuppance_title:0 "Colonial Comeuppance"
 S23_colonial_comeuppance_desc:0 "Raghamidesh , the shore of Rahen. Land of traders, wealth, greed and unashamed avarice. These tiger-loving fools thought themselves safe here, protected by the rough waves of the gulf, safe to prey upon us and our Mengi Brethren.\n\nNo longer.\n\nWe have crossed the scorching Salahad sands to bring justice to these foreign lands, far from Amilak’s grace. Some might pity them for that, practically godless and forsaken, but not we. The only salvation we offer the colonisers is in flame."

 S23_all_under_amilak_title:0 "All under Amilak"
 S23_all_under_amilak_desc:0 "The realm grows, and as it does so too must the numbers of the faithful. It does not do for denizens of the new holy realm to worship heathen gods; it is an affront to all that is holy. Amilak’s realm is for Amilak alone, though of course he permits Kvanga her domain.\n\nWe shall bring his word and worship to our new subjects, and save their hollow souls."

 S23_none_are_guiltless_title:0 "None are Guiltless"
 S23_none_are_guiltless_desc:0 "Rahen’s coast is ash, but still that is not enough. Amilak’s wind pushes on, and justice must be served. We Ofehibi are no strangers to shackles and chains, and the Raheni know this well, for they have bought our slaves in plenty for long centuries past. Still, it will be a change for us to hold the lash longer than the auction blocks, and a change for them to find themselves beneath its bite.\n\nSome say the people of Rahen are innocent of their master's crimes, and perhaps the blood on their hands is less, yet they sip the saucers of our suffering nonetheless. We are better than they however, and will offer them the chance to repent, a penance served in toil."

 S23_all_rahens_rot_title:0 "All Rahens Rot"
 S23_all_rahens_rot_desc:0 "From the days of the first Harimraj, Rahen has held a rot. The harimari may be admirable conquerors, but like the tiger they are lazy, decadent. Within a few short generations corruption bloomed and festered within their lotus court, a corruption that has never ended.\n\nThe rot cannot be cleansed through the burning of the trade states alone. No, it must be excised at its very heart - the Raj itself. Dehinjansar is the seat of its power, and so Dehinjansar must be ours. To take it will signal the end of Rahen’s age - the beginning of our ascendance."

 S23_wrongs_righted_title:0 "Wrongs Righted"
 S23_wrongs_righted_desc:0 "The wind of Amilak grows still.\n\nOur murdered royals rest well in Amilak’s realm, their deaths avenged. Our people stand together; though some may grumble still, none can deny our unity. The way calls us home now, there is a celebration to be had. The capital must be prepared, the people will hear of our victories!"

 S23_overtures_east_title:0 "Overtures East"
 S23_overtures_east_desc:0 "We are not alone in our precarious position; many other Mengi kingdoms face similar external threats. Proud kingdoms such as Boyebareti stand surrounded, and even inland clans such as Teleksemayi see encroachment on their borders, to say nothing of those realms that stare down the trollish hordes of Yezel Mora.\n\nIf the Mengi are to emerge independent from these trying times, we must do so together. It was unity that made us great under Zenidir, and though no Mezhi’Mezhi will be born here, united we can stand nonetheless."

 S23_establishing_the_rabwag_title:0 "Establishing the Rabwag"
 S23_establishing_the_rabwag_desc:0 "Queen Seble has outlined a dramatic reform of our military, integrating the gnolls into a lightly armoured infantry outfit to be known as the Rabwag. The fast and powerful gnollish infantry, unburdened by heavy armour, will be able to keep pace with our Awirenya atop their Rhinos, enabling us to better support and supply them in the field. Unity here is our strength, gnolls and humans complimenting each other in ways they could never have previously managed."

 S23_queen_and_matriarch_title:0 "Queen and Matriarch"
 S23_queen_and_matriarch_desc:0 "Our young Mezhi faces some difficulty establishing her rule. Though all true Hisosti hearts bleed for her, many fail to see past her youth and gender. Unlike we humans though, our gnollish brethren have no qualms accepting the rule of a woman, and many of the packs now pledging loyalty to our Seble are themselves led by matriarchs. This unexpected avenue of support may provide great dividends in future, but for now we must rally the rest of the people in their example. Bringing peace and wealth to the realm will surely aid in this."

 S23_economic_integration_title:0 "Economic Integration"
 S23_economic_integration_desc:0 "In the course of our recent development efforts, it has come to our attention quite how much of our commerce relies on the thrift and hard graft of gnolls. Their careful recycling and clever craft forms a significant portion of the work done in our society, but it is unfortunately quite disconnected from the human economy by a series of anti-gnollish laws and local edicts. With gnolls being integrated into our state thanks to the Mezhi’s reforms, it's time to allow gnollish work to thrive, and our coffers with it."

 S23_troubles_at_home_title:0 "Troubles at Home"
 S23_troubles_at_home_desc:0 "Discontent has erupted amongst the Yenaze Mezhi over the Mezhi’s integration of gnolls into our realm. They whine and moan, claiming that the rights given to gnolls infringe on their traditional privileges, that allowing gnolls to serve in the military sidelines their importance. The most bold amongst them even daring to withhold due taxes from our coffers and levies from our armies.\n\nClearly in our Mezhi’s absence they have forgotten their place. We must remind them where their loyalties lie, and secure the prosperity of our state. Who knows what plots may be brewing behind closed doors…"

 S23_gnolls_in_the_awirenya_title:0 "Gnolls in the Awirenya"
 S23_gnolls_in_the_awirenya_desc:0 "With the borderline seditious Yenaze Mezhi quelled for now, it is finally an opportune time to continue the transformation of our military, and finalise the integration of gnolls into our armies. Up til now membership in the Awirenya, our renowned rhino-riding cavalry, has been restricted entirely to the most elite of our human populace. No longer.\n\nThe gnollish contingent of the Rabwag have already formed strong bonds with our existing Awirenya and many have more than proven their worth to join. We shall fund an expansion of our military facilities into our gnollish territories to enable this."

 S23_changing_times_title:0 "Changing Times"
 S23_changing_times_desc:0 "How wrong we were.\n\nTo think our victory complete, to think ourselves on top of the world, so close as to touch the skies. What hubris, what negligence. The Yenaze Mezhi have shown us that the rot is not so easily cleared, that without vigilance, rot may grow at home too. We must overcome these coupists, for the memory of our ideals - for the memory of our Queen!"

 S23_reparations_title:0 "Restoration"
 S23_reparations_desc:0 "Many have suffered during the coup, but none of our subjects more so than the gnolls. Subject to harsh reprisals for their perceived wrongs by the Yenaze Mezhi, many have lost wealth, homes, even family. Though it is impossible to put right every wrong - for no amount of gold will raise the dead - we must make an effort to reforge the chains that hold together our society. It shall begin with improving the lives of our gnollish citizens."

 S23_renewed_title:0 "Renewal"
 S23_renewed_desc:0 "Not all our prior goals were misplaced. To struggle against injustice is always righteous, the crusade against the servants of Yrilak - evil itself - is the highest purpose of all. With that in mind, once more the wind stirs west; surely a sign of Amilak’s favour on our road to redemption, yet also a call to action. The infernal Xhazobkult still plagues the Sarhali plains. We shall cleanse them, once and for all."

 S23_in_the_heart_of_darkness_title:0 "In the Heart of Darkness"
 S23_in_the_heart_of_darkness_desc:0 "There exists no greater den of evil than the Shadowswamp. Yrilak’s domain upon Halann, the very heart of darkness itself, it is infested by the corrupted troll and their hag masters. It is not just these swamp-dwellers that serve the anathema however - the land itself is sick, oozing shadow as if wounded. There is an old monument on the edges of the swamp, a relic from the times before its spread. We will restore it, a statement of our intent."

 S23_hags_in_the_room_title:0 "The Hags In the Room"
 S23_hags_in_the_room_desc:0 "Scattered stories used to speak of a dark tear at the swamp’s heart, a tree full of nails that bled darkness, an effigy of horror. It is no story anymore, but a truth. At the centre of the swamp stands a great tree, one clearly grown for noble purpose, but perverted to aid evil.\n\nNo longer.\n\nAmilak’s wind blows, a great gale ushering us on as none have felt since Queen Seble’s day. We will bring his light to this dark realm, cleanse the Matriarch, and chase the Hag trio into the very darkness that spawned them!"

 S23_siblings_under_the_sky_title:0 "Siblings under the Sky"
 S23_siblings_under_the_sky_desc:0 "The Mengi are not the most united of peoples; aside from the short lived unification of our states under the great Zenidir, we have been shattered and warring for centuries. Yet despite this, the bonds between us are undeniable. Our actions have made us something of a shield for our fellow Mengi, and in our crisis of self identity, perhaps a reconnection with our brethren in the holy realm shall ground us."

 S23_side_by_side_title:0 "Side by Side"
 S23_side_by_side_desc:0 "Unity has proven its power countless times, the combined strength of gnolls and humans together triumphing in endless battles from Sarhal to Rahen. Gnolls and humans serve together from the very bottom of our armies - the Rabwag, to the very top - the Awirenya. It is time to complete the transformation of our military in its entirety. Gnolls and Humans shall fight side by side, on rhino back and foot. With teeth and trampling hooves."

 S23_elephant_awirenya_title:0 "Elephant Awirenya"
 S23_elephant_awirenya_desc:0 "The elephant lords of Dhujat are a people surprisingly similar to our own. They too have tamed the local fauna, and hold the animals to be of great import, basing their society around them. Though our Rhino are naturally more worthy of reverence than their elephants, we cannot help but feel a certain kinship here. Their Elephant riders are impressive indeed, and the considerable bulk of elephants makes them much better suited as mobile gun and artillery platforms than our shock-focused rhino. Integrating them into our Awirenya will dramatically improve our capacity for war."

 S23_forgiveness_title:0 "Forgiveness"
 S23_forgiveness_desc:0 "From the western Salahad coast, across the savannah, into the swamp and north across the Gulf, to the very foot of the Serpentspine mountains. Thus lies our land, the domain of Amilak, the holy realm itself. Across this wide stretch the hymns of praise will be heard, and all will look up at the skies with reverence.\n\nSurely this will be enough: surely, at long last, we will finally have atoned?"

 S23_restitution_title:0 "Restitution"
 S23_restitution_desc:0 "Injustice was done to us, plain and true, and Rahen’s rulers deserved their lot. But their people have no part in the events that happened, had no agency in the choices made. It is one thing to trade in blood and sweat, to cross coins for flesh and toil, but another entirely to see it day by day, to see the lives of these people. No, it is clear now there is no righteousness in forcing them to slave in shackle and chain for another's crime. The moral weight of indenture can only be individual - such restitution cannot be collective."

 S23_ruins_of_the_raj_title:0 "Ruins of the Raj"
 S23_ruins_of_the_raj_desc:0 "The Raj fell by our hand, its rot burnt away, but in the ashen ruin no hope blooms. What we billed as triumph was merely chaos, and across Rahen the castes remain, societies bound in chains of the mind. It is peculiar perhaps, our aversion to such order, but there is no nobility in the castes - no room for growth or emancipation. The castes are chains eternal, bound not to a person but to an entire people.\n\nWe did not break the castes then, but we can now. Central Rahen shall fall under our dominion, and we shall shatter the limits of the castes even beyond those borders. Anyone shall be allowed to be anything, provided they earn it!"

 S23_along_the_kharuyana_title:0 "Along the Kharuyana"
 S23_along_the_kharuyana_desc:0 "It seems the whole world over runs on rivers - and it is easy to see why. The mighty Kharunyana rivals even our Keygas, and the peoples of Rahen thrive on her banks, if yet still under the grip of oppressors. If one looks north along the river, even from many leagues south, the shadow of Mt. Tughayasa can be seen. The Raheni tell of the oracle atop the peak, and we wonder. Could a place so close to the sky, even so far from the holy realm, be Amilak’s domain?"

 S23_plains_of_shamakhad_title:0 "The Plains of Shamakhad"
 S23_plains_of_shamakhad_desc:0 "The Plains of Shamakhad: once a realm of heroes, then a bridgehead for a tide of hobgoblin invaders, the scourge of Haless. Whatever they may be now, they have had a long and storied history. Proud lands and a proud people, who should not suffer under the boot of oppressors. We will be better than they, however - even those who thought to stand above others will be accepted in our new domain."

 S23_peeling_back_the_paint_title:0 "Peeling Back the Paint"
 S23_peeling_back_the_paint_desc:0 "The story of Bhuvauri is a tragedy. Once a slave uprising, the downtrodden fighting for justice, a noble dream indeed. Yet with their victory came an even truer defeat, as they turned to the very thing they had broken free of to ensure their new freedom. Chains taken from their own bodies handed over to others, a mocking and pale imitation of manumission. Perhaps we are not ones to judge, but it is a wrong we can right all the same. The whited sepulchre will come crashing down, another step on our path to forgiveness."

 S23_our_own_sins_title:0 "Our Own Sins"
 S23_our_own_sins_desc:0 "It is one thing to know evil in others, and to remove it from them, but it is hardest of all to see evil in oneself.\n\nFor long years the Ofehibi have dealt in slaves, and much wealth has come to our lands as a result of it. Our people turned their back on the traditions of the Mengi in the chase for coin, exchanging the redemptive toil of indenture for a trade in chattels. Yet now in equal measure we see that suffering too has come from it, not even strictly of those forced into toil, but in the fact that it is our institutions of slavery that led to Rahens predations. We pretend at redemption, at forgiveness, yet we turn a blind eye towards those in our own lands still under the lash and whip.\n\nWe shall not let this stain us any longer. Slavery shall be abolished throughout Hisost Yamok, and together all shall step forward to a better future."

hisost.1.a: "Who cares?"
hisost.1.b: "Stop them!"
hisost.2.t: "16th Esmarment, 1452"
hisost.2.d: "We came upon the great wooden and stone quays at the water’s edge; not the nourishing water of Amilak, but the deep salt brine. I walked barefoot, just as the general Adeka chose in the wake of the Battle of Three Queens. The courtiers around me are different now. They are grave with me, just as I was once grave with Teacher Werikleb. I am discovering there are many coronations, and I have passed through the coronation of war. I wield fear, and am no longer a mere girl.\n\nThe city is practically levelled. We took our fires first to the poaching markets, the place where the Biribitid poacher scum slaughtered our rhinos by the dozen, carving out the ivory. Already as much a bazaar as an urban centre, the fires spread quickly through the sprawling wooden stands, and we can salvage little. No matter. We will rebuild this place into a port of our own, in earthwork and stone rather than wood. The conquest of this city is proof I can make my will known, proof that I stand for the glory of our people.\n\nThe burden placed upon me is nothing less than to reforge the pride of the Ofehibi, to punish those who trespass upon Amilak’s domain. I knew I could not convince my people to march for all of Madriamilak, not yet… but every village of my land loves its rhinos. We festoon their horns with flowers in the spring, sleep against their great bulk in the heavy haze of summer, laugh and cry and grow old alongside these noble creatures. Today I have proven that my people will kill and die for their rhinos, and soon perhaps they will kill and die for Amilak as well."
hisost.2.a: "It is justice that burns here."
hisost.3.t: "3rd Bloomsend, 1465"
hisost.3.d: "We watched from the cape as the shallow-bottomed boats of the Raheni merchants slowly bobbed over the horizon. Amilak’s work was done, and yet in all the works of war I see but mud and flame. Can it be anything but a sign that the rain began to drum as the Raheni took up their oars? That as I stood, watching those fleeing ships, the wind picked at the hem of my tunic?\n\nPerhaps I am still Teacher Werikleb’s spoiled girl, and her ghost chides me even now for imagining Amilak would ever speak right into my ear. But I cannot help it - I hear Him so keenly. I hear Him roar in joy, for His Domain has been returned to Him.\n\nI cried; I do not remember when I have cried last. I bade the others leave me be, and I knelt among the saltgrass and wept. It turns out I am terrible at it - great chunks tore from me in fits and starts, as though I had forgotten the rhythm of a dance. Amilak be praised for the raindrops on my cheeks which hid my tears, when finally I returned to camp. "
hisost.3.a: "The wind blows north."
hisost.4.t: "26th Bloomsdawn, 1442"
hisost.4.d: "They are all being kind to me. I requested another arrowfruit pudding, for which Cook must send two or three servants down into the ice cellar, and even Teacher Werikleb said nothing. I wish she had said ‘spoiled girl’ and told Cook not to listen. I wish she had sat me down instead and made me tell her who overthrew Komijagoshay VI, and by what tactics.\n\nEverybody is busy-busy, and there is nobody I can ask to tell me why I have not cried yet. The silly kitchen girls are all in floods of tears, holding each other’s faces in their hands and getting no work done, and they never even spoke to Father or Mother.\n\nThey executed all the guards of Kahazu II after he was murdered. Teacher Werikleb calls this absurd, and so I used my royal voice until they brought me the guard who found my parents. I asked him if he would guard me now, because I think regret will make him pay attention, and even he cried. But I just sat there like a big marrow with no juice at all.\n\nFather-mother ghosts, if you are peering over my shoulder, please forgive me that I have not cried."
hisost.4.a: "Afterwards, Weriklek gently bade me study."
hisost.4.b: "Afterwards, I spoke with the sky."
hisost.6.t: "14th Teysuren, 1449"
hisost.6.d: "Nesuha and Bishwos were fussing over the beading in my cape, and I am afraid we came to difficulties, right before I left for the acclaiming grounds. All of this is absurd, as if I have not sat and said my piece at every meeting of the council since I was first able to outrun a guard or two. They must clothe me in the history of the Ofehibi, about which our enemies care not a whit, and show the people I am their queen, which I already am.\n\nI find myself impatient with them, these good people who knew my parents far longer than I; who do not sometimes wake up in a sweat, wondering frantically if they remember Father’s face at all. I want to snatch the drink from their hands and ask how they can mingle in my honour when so much remains to be done, so many wrongs to be set to rights. I feel the water surge in me, a roiling in my belly which never seems to cease, which spurs me to fury. I feel the press of the wind at my back.\n\nIt is Amilak, and His purpose will not wait."
hisost.6.a: "I shall lead from the front."
hisost.6.b: "I shall lead from the throne."
hisost.7.t: "28th Silversight, 1481"
hisost.7.d: "Should I tell you, mother-father ghosts, of the ease of burning six cities after you have burned one? Of the wind that has blown at my back all this long way across the Salahad, right into the land of the murderers? Perhaps I seem cruel to you both, but I see more clearly than I ever have. It is not enough to drive the Raheni from our shores, for they are ceaselessly ambitious, and Amilak’s lesson not yet fully taught.\n\nWhen we pushed them from Madriamilak, the Raheni came to know the Mengi as a people against whom they could lose. Soon, they will perceive the blinding borders of Amilak’s realm, and the terrible cost which comes from trespassing but a little upon His domain."
hisost.7.a: "Yet his work continues."
hisost.8.t: "9th Castanmark, 1501"
hisost.8.d: "I write for you now, Nesuha beloved. Like me, you will one day rule without your mother. It is my hope that by dint of my life and work, you will not feel as lost as I once did. You will read these diaries one day, my scant justifications for a long, bloody life, and see all the places where I was terribly stupid. I have no doubt you will do much better.\n\nSelfish me, however - I have claimed the head of the Raj for my own glory. That which is rotten at its very top will splinter by nature, and as we stand in the decadent halls of the Golden Palace, I do not marvel at the beautiful things here. I see only earth, heavy and base. These Raheni have shackled themselves to Yrilak by lucre and base selfishness; they have no sense of godhood, not really, for their High Gods do not breathe at their back, do not cleanse them with cooling rain. Be not bound to earth, my daughter - this is the wisdom I find here.\n\nAmilak-King, is my purpose now done? Will Your wind now blow back towards the place where I yearn to be?" 
hisost.8.a: "Still the wind blows north."
hisost.8.b: "It is done at last."
hisost.9.t: "Triumphant Return"
hisost.9.d: "The streets near the palace were bursting at the seams, as people - both human and gnoll - crowded the streets in anticipation of the conquering hero's return. The air was abuzz with anticipation, joy and laughter, the kind of jubilance born only from a people without worry.\n\nA slow, steady rumbling began in the distance, gradually nearing, eliciting a roaring round of cheers from the assembled celebrators. From around the bend the source of the sound came into view, a great formation of Awirenya atop their rhinos, the ceremonial plate on both man and beast gleaming in the bright noon sun.\n\nBehind them came all the looted wealth of Rahen, the entire first float dedicated to carrying the huge, vaunted, Lotus throne itself, seat of the esteemed Raja. On the following floats, piles of gold, jewels, not to mention fine porcelain and rare spices. Helmless and mirthful Awirenya and Rabwag alike threw small handfuls of the coins out into the eager crowd, to the delight of those lucky enough to catch the riches.\n\nQueen Seble may not be with us anymore, but we know she’d be proud."
hisost.9.a: "Nothing could go wrong now!"
hisost.10.t: "13th Suren, 1507"
hisost.10.d: "We argued today, my Nesuha. You were so angry, so sure, and so wrong. I have never been prouder.\n\nPerhaps you will never think I was correct. Perhaps you will sit there, reading this as queen, and marvel still at the folly of your decrepit mother, insisting on going into the crowds of people with nary a guard in sight. But my darling, the people had made a river, a great flow of the Ofehibi. No danger lurks for me any more in the waters of the Sky Domain. I am finally home.\n\nAll the way back from the Ascension Peninsula, I have worried. Did I know His will? Did I realise what Amilak wished of me? The river carried me through the streets and I was laughing. I saw a woman with a grim-set mouth, no smile ready for her queen. She was like me, tall-tall, barely any tits. Our eyes met. In the woman’s arms was a gnoll cub, a little girl, curled up just the way you used to curl up, when things were a little too loud."
hisost.10.a: "At last, the end is here."
hisost.11.t: "The New Regime"
hisost.11.d: "The late Queen Seble was well beloved by the nation, conquer, visionary, integrator - but even her power quails before nature. Fundamental law demands: whenever you push, the world pushes back. The Yenaze Mezhi stayed quietely incensed whilst the queen was alive, seething at what they saw as centuries of traditional privilege uprooted - gnolls in the awirenya, in spaces and roles traditionally reserved for them. \n\nBut Seble isn't here anymore, and now they have played their hand. They had planned for a long time, every palace regiment had at least one mole and the nobles household warriors had memorized maps of the palatial complex. It was over in a moment. This new ruler who would’ve only led the nation into further gnoll filled madness was captured and executed in front of a gathering of the most powerful nobles in the land.\n\nWith this swift coup, the Yenaze Mezhi have taken control over the government to return things to what they call the proper order. There is a new word spread throughout the nation. Gnolls do not belong in positions of respect or authority; they only belong at the feet of humans, either kneeling in submission or broken for their resistance."
hisost.11.a: "We must oppose them!"
hisost.12.t: "Disloyalty amongst the Yenaze Mezhi"
hisost.12.d: "“She’s quite mad you know.” The fur clad nobleman remarked to his companion, as they passed a palace balcony overlooking the newly constructed Rabwag barracks.\n\n“Are you daft, Dula?” His similarly attired companion hissed back, with a worried glance at the gnolls training below. “If one of the dogs catches you saying that about the Mezhi they’ll have your head for dinner.”\n\n“That’s true, the monsters. But I wouldn’t worry, they only speak that yapping tongue. Full of yelps and whines.” He paused, following his companions gaze below. “They say the Mezhi can speak it too. I wonder if its her parents' death that did it, you know.” Dula spoke again, pausing to lean over the balcony and spit. “Set the madness in, I mean.”\n\nThe second shook his head. “I have no more love for them than you do my friend, but unlike you I am quite attached to my head, and have no desire to lose it.” His eyes flicked below again, and he resumed his walk.\n\n“I am merely grumbling Akau! There is no treason in that!” Dula called after him, watching him leave. “Merely grumbling.” He repeated to himself in a half mumble, spitting over the balcony one last time before himself continuing on."
hisost.12.a: "Worrying words."
hisost.13.t: "14th Truefrost, 1489"
hisost.13.d: "I resent being tugged away from my purpose, and perhaps the Yenaze Mezhi felt this. Perhaps this is why the traitors trembled so, when they were found and marched to death, for my purpose is Amilak’s, and they will have to account for themselves in the next life. In my absence, the indolent have prevailed. Their eyes have not beheld what we have, and they either do not remember or do not heed the lesson grimly taught by our Raheni occupiers.\n\nReluctantly, I must stay. The wind keeps my eyes clear, and I see that to surge forward now would be to see all I have built collapse behind me. This land, now liberated, must be set properly to rights, and its many peoples united under Amilak. There are no shortcuts.\n\nAt least I can be with Nesuha, and see her grown so strong. I am not what I once was, though I am no grandmother either, and in Nesuha’s fierce gaze, the strong set to her snout, I see the future of the Sky Domain. Fierce warrior and future queen, let her be guided well. If she is not, it will not be her fault, for she is in every way a daughter to be proud of. I have been gone so very often."
hisost.13.a: "I shall dispense justice."
hisost.13.b: "Amilak knows forgiveness."
hisost.14.t: "Gnollish Disilusion"
hisost.14.d: "The gnolls of the realm were somewhat worried when the first attempt was made to integrate them into our society. It was an arrangement unheard of; whenever humans and gnolls coexisted in the past, it was under the rule of demon worshipping Kultists who treated humans as slaves and fodder for sacrifices. When the shoe was on the other foot, humans ruthlessly exterminated every gnoll they could find. Queen Seble promised a third way, humans and gnolls living as equals, as brothers.\n\nTo the gnolls it seems her dream has died with her.\n\nThey may not be treated as monsters quite yet, but their current situation isn’t much better. They have come to see everything that was said to them as lies, and tragically that includes what we told them about Amilak as well. It is heartbreaking that they see their situation as a failing of Amilak and not us, His unworthy servants. They have turned their back on Amilak and returned to solely worshipping his godkin Kvanga. We cannot even blame them. Kvanga never betrayed them and from all appearances, through us, Amilak has."
hisost.14.a: "We have done more than fail the gnolls, we have failed Amilak."
hisost.14.a_tt: "Up to 15 §YGnollish Majority§! provinces will become Kvangahga"
hisost.15.t: "Awirenya lay down Arms"
hisost.15.d: "The Awirenya are the most elite force in the nation, possessing not just the great strength of other warrior elites but also truly noble hearts. It has been very embarrassing for the Yenaze Mezhi that these champions of our nation have nothing but scorn for its current leadership. After forging unbreakable bonds with their gnollish allies upon the field of battle, they immediately rejected the Yenaze Mezhi’s lies about gnolls being inferior to humans. To make their point they have, every last one of them, laid down their arms and refused to serve the Yenaze Mezhi. It has come as a shock to many: most Awirenya come from noble backgrounds themselves yet it seems their brothers in arms are more dear to them then their brothers in blood. With the heart of our army being ripped out, the Yenaze Mezhi’s ability to enact their policies has been severely hampered and it has proved to be disastrous for their image amongst the general populace."
hisost.15.a: "They were worthy of their name, but we weren’t worthy of them."
hisost.16.t: "A Nation Divided"
hisost.16.d: "The Yenaze Mezhi have seized much of the government, but not all of it. Still, it has been difficult for the sections that resist the Yenaze Mezhi to act against them openly. Now, circumstances dictate they might have to. Some elements of the Yenaze Mezhi have gone beyond persecuting or expelling gnolls and have begun to slaughter gnolls indiscriminately. This has been unacceptable for those parts of the government that still accept the gnolls, but this radical splinter of the Yenaze Mezhi have made it clear they won’t back down. An authority in the rival faction mulls over what to tell his fellows; what he decides will affect the response of the whole coalition."
hisost.16.a: "We must defend the gnolls."

hisost.16.b_tt: "Up to 3 provinces with a §YGnollish Minority§! will have their minority size §Ydecreased§!"
hisost.17.t: "Those in Need"
hisost.17.d: "Within our land exist charitable organizations, mostly headed by the Semayebaka, working to help those in need. These organizations are mostly focused around the faithful, however, and after the persecution gnolls have been facing from the Yenaze Mezhi, that tends to not include many gnolls. Though there are many humans in great need of aid, their plights are rarely as severe as our Gnoll citizens right now. Using the resources from these foundations, we could support many gnoll families facing persecution from the Yenaze Mezhi. Without it, several gnoll communities could die out entirely.\n\nThere is however an inherent problem - we’d essentially be robbing these foundations and deciding who was worthy of the donations. The people who donated to these foundations trusted the Semayebaka to give it to those in need and so we would be inherently disrespecting their will no matter what we do with it. Regardless of our reasoning, we can’t imagine Amilak would be pleased with us robbing the donations given to His priests. Moreover all the humans who rely on these charitable foundations would be left with nothing; it wouldn’t truly reduce the suffering, it would just place it on our human communities instead."

hisost.18.t: "Comrades in arms"
hisost.18.d: "The Awirenya refusing to serve the Yenaze Mezhi have served as an inspiration for the common soldiery. Many regiments are deserting, taking their equipment and training and going off to protect the gnolls from forces loyal to the Yenaze Mezhi. It’s a noble gesture, but one which leaves the realm with an immediate problem; we still need an army. Soldiers are deserting in such numbers that our army will be left significantly diminished if we don’t stop them. Cut off from the logistics of the state, it’s also questionable how capable they are of actually resisting a concentrated effort from the Yenaze Mezhi. Still, this is what they wish. We know the queen would’ve been proud of them."
hisost.18.a: "Encourage them!"
hisost.18.b: "Get them back in line!"
hisost.19.t: "Awirenya Example"
hisost.19.d: "After the disbanding of the Awirenya following the coup they have been the most outspoken opponents of the Yenaze Mezhi and have served as a beacon, shining to all our people and leading them away from the lies of the nobles. Their honor is unquestionable, their convictions beyond doubt. They serve as an example to us all and Amilak surely smiles upon them for their stoutheartedness. There is a great worry, however; we rely on their expertise greatly in the army. Even some of our allies, staunch opponents of the Yenaze Mezhi as they are, are not happy about the Awirenya’s choice, fearing that other nations will take advantage of our disunity. But if we only do good when its convenient, are we even doing good at all?"
hisost.19.a: "We must encourage them back into service."
hisost.19.b: "If we do not stand on principle we do not stand at all."
hisost.20.t: "Kindness of the commonfolk"
hisost.20.d: "A gnoll hidden here, a gnoll fed there, an agent of the Yenaze Mezhi sent in circles while some gnolls flee town. All across the nation, situations like these play out; many of the commonfolk see the gnolls as Mengi and are shielding them from the wrath of the Yenaze Mezhi. There are reprisals, of course: people beaten, jailed, even killed. These people, brave as they are, have no defence against the nobles that have risen to power. Despite the pain they are suffering, these people are helping the gnolls when we cannot. It’s certain many more gnolls would be expelled if the common folk didn’t shield them."
hisost.20.a: "Were everyone so selflessly brave!"
hisost.21.t: "Looting season"
hisost.21.d: "With the Yenaze Mezhi’s anti-gnoll policies in place, gnolls have lost many of their protections. Their property is no longer recognized by law, and so just about everyone from guilds to beggars have gotten in on the looting. This has been awful for the economy, with not only the loss of the craftsgnolls and merchant gnolls but also a large number of humans abandoning honest work in favor of theft. The Yenaze Mezhi are incredibly pleased; while they’d rather people not disregard law and order so flagrantly the ravaging of gnoll businesses has dramatically reduced the gnolls ability to oppose the Yenaze Mezhi. \n\nThere’s an opportunity for us to get in on this too. The temptation is whispered in our ears: we can use the money to help the gnolls in the future; sometimes we need to compromise to achieve our goals; if we don’t take their wealth some petty thief will take it instead and blow it on drink. Our conscience won’t leave us alone with those thoughts, however. We must ask ourselves: what Amilak would think? what would Seble think?"
hisost.21.a: "Their wealth could be better used…"
hisost.21.b: "This is wrong! Protect their property."
hisost.22.t: "Darkened skies"
hisost.22.d: "We swore that Amilak’s love transcended racial boundaries; we promised that gnolls and humans could live in harmony; we told our people that all could be Mengi. Now, under the leadership of the Yenaze Mezhi, we swear that Amilak favors only us, we promise that the gnolls will be subdued, we tell the people that the gnolls are beneath us. Such a flagrant change of our values has not gone unnoticed. Everywhere the people ask if we really know what Amilak wants, and if we do, then why has Amilak become so capricious? Some are wondering if Amilak is even speaking to us at all, or if the Semayabaka just say what they want to hear to make us believe they have His favor. Some are even wondering if Amilak is there at all… how else could such a blatant contradiction go unexplained? Most would never doubt their faith in Amilak, but their faith in us… not so much."
hisost.22.a: "Woe."
hisost.23.t: "Fallow Fields"
hisost.23.d: "The integration of gnolls into our society brought a new workforce; initially distrusted, the first roles they were encouraged into were less desirable jobs such as farm labour. Over time, many farms came to rely on gnollish workers. With the Yenaze Mezhi’s anti-gnoll policies in full effect, many gnolls have gone into hiding, and it’s hard to hide if you need to go to work at the same place every day. Many gnolls have chosen to simply stop showing up and there are not enough humans to replace them. Our advisors are warning of a nationwide famine."
hisost.23.a: "Thus we starve."
hisost.24.t: "Remember"
hisost.24.d: "Seble was our queen, our shining glorious queen. She marched on Rahen and overpowered all those states that would’ve enslaved us, even the so-called ‘Harimraj’. She avenged her parents’ murder. She beat back the darkness when it seemed poised to swallow us whole. She cooperated with our brother Mengi living in Amilaks realm. She spread the faith far and wide. Her greatest legacy however is also the one under the most threat, her harmony with the gnolls.\n\nShe brought them into every level of society. She accepted their godkin Kvanga and allowed those gnolls misled by demons from beyond to repent and come into Amilak’s loving embrace. She even raised a gnoll child, Nesuha Zor Melas-Sanzon, as her own. Seble was like Amilak’s thundering fury and soothing rain all at once, but the people know which one of those she’d give to the Yenaze Mezhi.\n\nIn the capital they marched by the thousands bearing the banner of Seble’s true heir, the banner of house Zor Melas-Sanzon. All the Yenaze Mezhi could do was keep the protestors contained; some of their forces even abandoned their posts and joined the protests as well. The Yenaze Mezhi eventually managed to scramble their most loyal squadrons. These troops finally broke up the protest… by force. They beat any who resisted, some of the protesters even died under the assault. In their zealousness the soldiers went as far as to break into several buildings in the capital, shattering windows and breaking doors off their hinges to get to protesters who had hidden inside.\n\nThough the protest was dispersed it did not matter, the damage had been done. The news of the great protest at the capital has spread like wildfire and all across the nation, new protests are starting, calling for an end to the coupists’ rule and the ascension of Nesuha."

hisost.25.d: "Kebek,\n\nDon’t nag me, I know it’s been ages. Never sit down to write anymore, if ever you needed proof I am not my mother. Thank you for the diaries. If she’d said half of these things to me!... No need at all to apologise either. That you kept them safe is a miracle.\n\nStrange to know a version of her with any doubt… always felt lazy around her, irresolute. Trying to remind myself of the bit from ‘Hajo’s Loom’ - “those who shrink from the blade fear the same for their people”. Or you very kindly telling a seven year-old me it was fine I was shit at military history, because mum had done all the conquering… not one of you knew how to talk to children, by the way.\n\nWe’re done with the trials, at least for nobility and officials. Mulling a final amnesty to put things properly to bed. One thing mum never understood is that if an enemy thinks they can never come back from the desert, they’ll keep fighting you, they’ll never change. Need the little Mezzies to think we won’t judge them for their dumbshit parents. And we need that whole sorry time to finally feel over. For us gnolls, too. Put a line under it all and get on with building something new.\n\nMum wanted gentle rains and waves of grain, like me. She wanted a silly, peaceful people. I see a bit of myself in that, which is even lovelier than it sounds. It’s not that we didn’t get on… well, you know. Now I get that it was about her, not me.\n\nAlright, getting weepy. Please consider coming to the capital. Won’t rope you into teaching the kids, I promise.\n\n- Nez\n\nPS: I’ve sent some of my winter melon from the palace gardens. Don’t care if you think it’s a silly affectation, they taste better when I grow them."
hisost.25.a: "A new beginning."
hisost.26.t: "Hag Hunt"
hisost.26.d: "There is no darkness quite like that of the shadow plane, not in the heart of the swamp or in any deep cavern - this is a truth the Awirenya had learned quickly upon entering the realm of evil. Yrilak’s domain seemed determined to confound them; for hours they had fought deep into the morass, and even here the Hag’s troll servants still fought - though in fewer and fewer number - as blade, claw and hoof found their marks.\n\nNow they stopped, their boots cracking on the wilted leaves littering the ground. Dead - like everything else in this cursed place.\n\n“Captain!” one of the scouts ahead called, beckoning the leader of the company, a tall Gnoll named Aderv, forwards. “We’ve got a problem.” She nodded forwards. “The trail splits. Three ways. They’ve separated.”\n\nAderv swore.\n\n“We can’t risk separating the company.” The scout continued, glancing back at the weary collection of human and gnoll.\n\n“Don’t you think I know that?” Aderv barked back, his irritation almost illuminating the darkness. “The Mezhi shall have to live with but one Hag’s head. May Amilak forgive us.” He straightened, cleaned his blade on the bottom of his tabard, and called out. “Awirenya! Our quarry splits, and so we must pick our trail!”"
hisost.26.a: "Follow the heavy tracks."
hisost.26.b: "Follow the concealed path."
hisost.26.c: "Follow the light step."
hisost.27.t: "Hireet"
hisost.27.d: "The trolls were more numerous this direction. Not that that was surprising to Adarv - he’d expected the most resistance in this direction, but also the most reward.\n\nThe entire shadow plane was a morose place, and yet somehow the Hag lair they’d now found themselves in put the rest of it to shame. Bodies littered the halls, and not just the ones put there by the hand of the Awirenya. Desiccated rib cages, severed heads, torn limbs - mostly troll in origin - were strewn about like discarded toys.\n\nThey came to the final chamber, and Adarv held his breath. They could all feel it, the presence within. None could mistake the aura of such evil, and none could deny at least a little fear. Still, Amilak pushed at his back. He yelled the order to charge.\n\nBlood, screams, chaos. Carnage from the moment they opened the door. The form of a huge, hulking she-troll, impossibly tall and muscular, eyes alight with sadistic glee. Human and Gnoll alike went flying beneath its heavy swings. Adarv barely dodged, ducking under its tall frame, and circled round behind it. More of his men flooded the room, their bravery undimmed even as a fresh wave of the Hag’s dark power snuffed out the life of a half dozen of them. He struck across its back, a deep gash into its rough hide, and the monster screamed. He knew then they were going to win - there were too many of them, and she was too weak - too spent from the long wars - to muster Yrilak’s dark will against them.\n\nThe other Awirenya seized the opening, opening fresh wounds that failed to heal, and the creature's form flickered. No longer was a troll before them, but a Hag.\n\n“Why serve your empty God? What good has come to you, from it, to be sent to this place to die? Follow me instead, and know what you have always longed for. Something true and real, a place to belong.” Hireet seethed, but her words rang with desperation.\n\nAdarv swung at her head.\n\nIt was not a clean kill. It took him fully six swipes to sever it from her thick neck, and all the while she thrashed, another half dozen Awirenya piling in to restrain her. At last she fell, and he took the severed lump off the bloodied ground, leaking a vile ichor which he thought green in colour."
hisost.27.a: "“We don’t need your lies, Hag.”"
hisost.28.t: "Illfanill"
hisost.28.d: "The tracks were painstakingly hidden, and at many times Adarv feared they had lost the trail. If not for the Semayabaka they’d brought with them, they almost certainly would have. He had no mind for magic, but supposedly the trail had been masked with it, a clever concealment spell designed specifically to enable one to pass without trace. Luckily the residue of such sorcery was as traceable as footprints, if one knew how to look.\n\nThey came upon a concealed cave, its entrance shrouded in a seemingly impenetrable cloud of darkness - somehow even less permeable than the persistent gloom of the rest of the profane plane. He sent the scouts in first; a cave like this might be a death trap for the unwary. His caution was rewarded in the worst way - with the death screams of his companions, as some of his scouts encountered whatever horrible magics the hag had left for them.\n\nHe gritted his teeth, and turned to the company. “We go in together now. We know it's there. We are swift, and we don’t stop. If anyone falls next to you then you keep going. Only the bitch’s head ends this.” He led, and the rest of the Awirenya followed.\n\nIt was hell in here. Not merely figuratively, but literally. The cavern wound and bent, tunnels looped and curved on each other. Time seemed to have lost all meaning - had they been inside for minutes, or hours? In the perpetual blackness all Adarv knew for sure was that his friends were dying. Odd screams rang out, as more and more Awirenya fell victim to the cruel machinations of the foe. Then, suddenly, hope.\n\n“Here!” Their mage yelled, a burst of light in the darkness. Illuminated by the glow of his staff, the figure of an ancient wizened crone, her fingers far far too long, loomed in the corner of the cavern ahead. Adarv charged, a prayer to Amilak on his lips, and the wind at his back.\n\nThe next minute was a blur. His body moved, the hag's magic stung, and his sword seemed to strike on its own. When he next blinked, he was standing alone in a circle of corpses, the hag’s decapitated body in the centre, its head in his hand."

hisost.29.d: "The steps they had elected to follow could almost have been made by a child, light and staggered as if skipping. As they marched after them, the world around seemed to grow lighter, brighter - the air more crisp, sweeter - yet at the same time less clear, shrouded in a mist.\n\n“Captain, you think we’re getting close to the rift again?” A squeaky voice piped up behind him, surely the youngest among their company. “Shut up and keep your guard up.” Adarv hissed in reply, his eyes darting side to side.\n\n“Now now. There’s no need for that. Come, sit.” A melodic tone issued from somewhere ahead; the shroud of mist parted to reveal a small cottage by a stream. It was almost like the material world here, temperate and tranquil. Outside the cottage sat a woman of stunning beauty, radiant like the sun, the lower half of her face obscured by a gentle veil.\n\nThe youngling made to step forward, but Adarv’s arm met his move. “Don’t. That’s her.”\n\n“Oh come now, why be like that? I am no threat to you. The coven is broken already - I bear you no malice. In fact, I would like to help. I shall need a new home, and surely your realm would benefit from my support.” The woman's eyes twinkled, warm, earnest.\n\nAdarv shook his head. He was too old, too faithful, to fall for such tactics. His hand moved to his sword - but the youngling's tongue was faster. “We’ll take it! What can you offer us?”\n\nBeneath the veil, her smile curled cruelly. Without warning, light faded, and mist turned thick smoke. The youngling screamed, a wicked black light erupting from him. “He’s corrupt!” one of the others yelled, turning their blade on him, only to be met by another's parry.\n\nChaos erupted. Near blind in the dark Awirenya fought Awirenya, each thinking the other foe. Beneath the maddened din Adarv crawled forwards. Komina still sat at her table, her eyes aglow with Yrilak’s magic, veil torn and wicked, rotten teeth on full display. She smiled still as Adarv’s blade met her flesh, and the light in her eyes went dim. Adarvs ears must have betrayed him, for he could’ve sworn her last sound was a sigh of relief."
hisost.29.a: "“Friends! Stop. The Hag is dead.”"
hisost.30.t: "6th Teysuren, 1449"
hisost.30.d: "I ran away today. How funny, and how childish.\n\nIt has been a long time since the guards have been able to catch me, all weighed down with their armour. Tall-tall girl, like my mother called me, long-long legs. But today there was nobody to chase me back, for I have discovered that coronations do not really need their queens. Until I am called, I am a bit of furniture - and thank Amilak for that!\n\nI lay on my back on the Callers’ Rock; they make the rain from there sometimes, if they are feeling particularly dramatic. My girls came to find me, Nesuha and Bishwos, for they had annoyed the clerks too much with their giggling and we were all practically banished. They brought me arrowfruit and curry goat and a little of the grain wine, and Bishwos talked endlessly of that silly boy she is going to marry.\n\nWe told her not to say yes until he has sworn his loyalty to everyone who matters to her; until he has proven he will add to her life. We stuffed ourselves too-too full, and lay flat on our backs under the afternoon sun like plump little pigs, arguing exactly how many times he must come to the house before Bishwos says yes. I wonder, sometimes, of a life with only this kind of calculus.\n\nPerhaps one day, all Ofehibi girls will be so fat and silly and stupid. So much grain will spill from the granaries that they will never have so much as thought of hunger. They will flit across the street from compound to compound, unable to choose between five or six imported dresses, making and breaking friendships over the smallest disputes. They will be a terror to their parents, heedless and disrespectful, and they will worry about nothing at all.\n\nI hope so."
hisost.30.a: "We think you'd be proud."
hisost.31.t: "Caste Breaker"
hisost.31.d: "Upper, middle, lower. Hierarchy unbending, chains that shackle the soul.\n\nIt is not hypocrisy to judge when one is guilty of sin oneself. No, instead it is all the more noble for it, to carry sin yet do good despite it. Rahen’s castes chain her people, there is no growth in them, merely stagnation and decay. We shatter them, as we have before, as we will again - so all may come to Amilaks light together."
hisost.31.a: "In his name!"
hisost.32.t: "To Touch the Sky"
hisost.32.d: "The summit trail was rough and steep. Loose stones littered the footworn path up the rock face, often sharp and jagged in a way that cut even through the toughest footwear. [Root.Monarch.GetName] grunted, grasping a makeshift staff, and pulled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self up above another boulder.\n\nWhat had possessed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to make this journey? It was not for the same reason so many other pilgrims had dragged themselves to the oracle of Tughayasa - [Root.Monarch.GetName] put no stock in Raheni divination, formidable as their magics may be. Seble had always forged her own destiny, and in her name [Root.Monarch.GetName] would do the same. It was the sky itself [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sought, atop a mountain so high it dwarfed anything [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] might’ve found in Madriamilak. Throughout the campaign in Dhujat, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had nursed a doubt, a gnawing unease in the pit of their stomach. Could Rahen REALLY be the holy realm, as much as Madriamilak was? [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stumbled as they rose above the crest of the next incline, clutching [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] staff to maintain balance in face of the sudden drop before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nIt had arrived already - the peak. Nothing else rose above [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], nothing else but the sky. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stretched out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] hand towards it.\n\n“Amilak, lord. Are you here?”"
hisost.32.a: "And he was."
hisost.33.t: "Burnished Brass"
hisost.33.d: "“[Root.Monarch.GetName] strolled through the streets of Sramaya, enjoying the sunlight and the beauty of the city. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] sat on a bench overlooking the harbor, and just took in the sights. Laughter filled the streets as human and harimari children wrestled together.\n\n“Beautiful, isnt it?” A voice said, as a woman sat beside [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Heavily laden in jewelry, necklaces and bracelets made of brass, each a different age and style, she had for all the appearance of a merchant.\n\n“It is,” the disguised ruler replied. “It is a lovely day, one could not ask for better conditions to walk in.”\n\n“And now, thanks to you, my lord, many more can enjoy it. I was not referring to the weather, but to them.” She nodded toward the playing children, where a hobgoblin girl was yelling at the wrestling boys, telling them to stop. “The chains have been broken, and the weight they carried is already starting to lift. It is a long road from here, but moments like this are now possible. Those children will become friends, and none of them will have to call the other master.”\n\n“So, you recognized me. I admit that I was taking this stroll to see how things have changed. What have you seen pass your stall, peddler?”\n\n“I have seen many things over the years. I have seen cruelty, I have seen hypocrisy, I have seen hate, and I have seen bigotry in its most pure form. But now, I think this city may be on the right path. Only by righting the mistakes of yesterday can the people have a better tomorrow.”\n\n“Right you are. I just hope that it lasts. Traditions can be hard to change, and people can be fickle.”\n\n“The people will tell you. They will not let you backslide without paying for it. They will be watching. I will always be watching.” And for a moment, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thought the peddlers' eyes changed. In the glinting sunlight, her skin took a darker shade, and the reflection of the copious amount of jewelry made her eyes and face seem just as brass as the jewels.\n\n“What do you mean by-“ [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] started, but was distracted as the wrestling boys rolled into the hobgoblin girl. She hurt her knee and started crying. The boys stopped their fight to make sure she was ok, and as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] returned his focus to the bench, he realised it was vacant. The peddler had left without a word.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stood up. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] still had some time, and was shaken by the woman’s words. Perhaps [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not yet too old to entertain playing children for a few hours before returning to the palace."
hisost.33.a: "A new day in Sramaya."
hisost.34.t: "Date Unknown"
hisost.34.d: "They are all being kind to me. I asked for something ridiculous, just to see if they would find it, and now a small harp seal from the Naléni cape barks his happy bark at me from the corner of the room. I wish I had Teacher Werikleb, to call me ‘spoiled girl’. She would sit me down and make me tell her who overthrew Komijagoshay VI, and by what tactics.\n\nI will die soon, so they say. My breath will end and my waters will still. I recognise the chance, not always given, to once more push my air into the world. Thank you, Amilak. Everybody is busy-busy, and there is nobody I can ask to tell me why I have not cried yet. They are preparing for the next who will lead; I am forgotten already, except that they are being kind.\n\nReader, know this. My name was Seble, and I felt the wind of Amilak at my back, and smiled when it rained. I had knobbly knees, and I loved my teacher, and I could run so fucking fast. I wolfed down anything made with arrowfruit, and I honoured my father and mother. If ever you are running to place your knife in the heart of an agent of injustice, then I am running with you."
hisost.34.a: "Goodbye, great queen."
hisost.90.t: "Ruler of the Southern Sands"
hisost.90.d: "The desert wind blew across the jagged sands; broken standards littered the ground and tattered banners flitted listlessly in the breeze. Two armies had clashed on the dunes, a meeting of savagery, discipline, and divine will. The fighting had been fierce, as sun fought sky on the ground below, but now the battlefield lay silent, save for the fading groans of the wounded and still dying.\n\nThe battle was long over now, the foe broken and dispersed, the sun low and dim, settling beneath the horizon. Yet despite that the sky shone clear and bright, illuminated by the fading light into purest blue.\n\nThe sun is just a feature of the sky."
hisost.90.a: "They will not stand in our way any longer."
hisost.90.b: "Continue on til there is nothing left!"
hisost.91.t: "Under The Burning Sun"
hisost.91.d: "Slain on the field - the queen is dead, the adversary has triumphed!"
hisost.91.a: "Our light has gone out."
hisost.97.t: "Kvangahga Devout"
hisost.97.d: "“Hear all the word of Amilak!” The voice rang in the distance. “Submit to his majesty, for you live in his domain!”\n\n“He’s still at it, Griz.” One gnoll said to the other. The two sat in a shaded area off the main path, out of sight - though not by design.\n\n“Just ignore him, Eveg.” Grizaka replied, deftly threading a string through a small jewel as part of a necklace. “He means well, in his own way. The humans, they simply do not understand Kvanga. They see only Amilak, and Yrilak. Good and evil. They know not the earth that blooms, that gives life.”\n\n“Hmph. If you’re sure. We could leave you know. These Semayabaka are more annoying by the day.” Eveg harrumphed, lifting his hammer and focusing his attention back onto his work. He thumped the head of a new axe down onto its shaft.\n\n“No Eveg. That priest is annoying, but the Mezhi is kind, in her heart. She understands our people, knows our worth. Here we may have a better future than the plains, a future where human and gnoll may live together. This is a world Kvanga would want, a world of virtue.” She stood, stretching, holding up the finished item. “Done, I think.”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“I thought I might make a gift of it to our friend. Perhaps he will start to understand.” Grizaka smiled, and strode towards the preaching voice."
hisost.97.a: "Perhaps we can co-exist?"
hisost.98.t: "Of Gnoll and Man"
hisost.98.d: "The reformed Hisost Yamok operates as a royal Diarchy, with power centralised in the dynasty of house Melas-Sanzon and its two branches, both the human and gnollish sides of the family.\n\nThis arrangement means that with the ascension of a new monarch, or the death of an heir, there is no shortage of talented young blood ready to step in line. We must merely choose which side of the dynasty to favour this time."
hisost.98.a: "The gnollish line."
hisost.98.b: "The human line."
hisost.104.t: "Forgiveness"
hisost.104.d: "Deeds are done and pass by, entering the annals of history. No matter what it is that happens, has happened, or will happen, Amilak will be there casting his judgement. No matter what, we know we can atone."
hisost.104.a: "He can forgive us."
