 G46_care_for_our_youngest_title: "Care For Our Youngest"
 G46_care_for_our_youngest_desc: "Degakheion is old and proud, and has in his time conceived two strong children. The first Nékheis, Eneion has long been our loyal hand in the Devand – and their obedience has brought honour to themselves and their father.\n\nAnd yet, our younger child does not share the same sense of loyalty. Deyeion, founded as a prison colony, has seen innumerous revolts and grasping attempts at “independence”. As a city of Karkares, it is no wonder – but the situation cannot be allowed to stand. Our bonds with Eneion must be strengthened and reinforced, and our control over Deyeion cemented once and for all. They must know that Degakheion, and no one else, is their future as well as their past."
 G46_end_the_experiment_title: "End the Experiment"
 G46_end_the_experiment_desc: "The independence of Amgremós was a disgraceful stain on Kheionai history, in no small part due to what it implied. The idea that a Nékheis can exist independently of their fathers is a foolish one, and those witless few who espouse such an idea must be punished.\n\nIt is therefore most fortunate that Amgremós has been subjugated by our august city. They have long been a symbol of separatism and disorder, and it now falls to us to reforge them into a symbol of something greater. A symbol of law: our law.\n\nAll that remains is for us to decide what shape this symbol shall take.."
 G46_teachings_of_a_child_title: "Teachings of a Child"
 G46_teachings_of_a_child_desc: "When a child acts out of turn, it is the fault of the parent, and so both must be punished in measure to their authority. So teaches the Drivós Rochos, but our venerable philosophy has less to say of what the children of today may teach their elders of tomorrow.\n\nThis is as it should be, for adherence to tradition is key to society. But even so, we can see our firstborn Eneion, loyal Eneion, charging forth into the continent, learning from their new home, and taking to heart lessons that we could never learn on our island.\n\nThe warden needs his subordinates to keep order. And if we are to be master of the Nekheis, perhaps it is time to learn from our most capable subordinate too?"
 G46_keeping_a_child_in_line_title: "Keeping a Child In Line"
 G46_keeping_a_child_in_line_desc: "Eneion has maintained their loyalty and proved their usefulness to us throughout our campaigns on the mainland. Their forces have fought by our side at every turn as we have enforced the dominance of Degakheion on the Cleaved Sea – and their diplomatic expertise and voice of authority as the first of the Kheions has made them vital in maintaining our control.\n\nUnfortunately, they are beginning to recognise their usefulness – and perhaps overestimate their worth. Some talk of an “ascendancy among the Devabhen”, of “holding the torch together”. Traitors talk of “passing it on”. That cannot be done. We must remind them that they are an administrative unit – a loyal tool, but a tool nonetheless. What better way to do so, and to make use of their talents, than to burden them further? And, of course, reorganise our Devandic territories in the process."
 G46_betrayal_on_ever_front_title: "Betrayal on Every Front"
 G46_betrayal_on_ever_front_desc: "Degakheion has two allies - His army and his navy. This is not to say that we have not found common cause with our neighbours on occasion, most recently with Oktikheion in the partition of Kimánis. But it was never a question of “if” Oktikheion would prove unworthy of our trust. Merely of “when”.\n\nNow the Oktibhen army sits and feasts in the ruins of Kimánis, land rightfully ours, yet hastily stolen by this profligate host. They have no honour, and so they expect treachery from us in turn. They will find none. We will honour our truce, for our word is our bond.\n\nAnd when this truce is over, we will crush them under our boot."
 G46_rock_and_a_hard_place_title: "Rock and a Hard Place"
 G46_rock_and_a_hard_place_desc: "We have made light work of both the grasping merchants of Ormam and the profligates of Oktikheion. Still, there is more to be done. To our north lies Arpedifér, whose magical prowess demands respect. To the south lies Kherka, whose forges produce the finest arms and armour on Alecand. Both Kheion are rich and powerful, and they will make for worthy campaigns. And when they fly the flag of Degakheion, our domination over our island will be assured. First, though, we will need to take care of business at home – and secure our new conquests once and for all."
 G46_secure_the_interiour_title: "Secure The Interior"
 G46_secure_the_interiour_desc: "All the Kheions of Alecand have knelt before Degakheion, and our glorious city now truly lives up to its name. Despite their opposing us at every turn, the Kheions are kin, and we will gladly concede that they have fought with valour and at least some competence.\n\nHow unlike them then are the bharbhen of Elitbhar, who hold the west of Alecand under their savage dominion. There can be no negotiation with this tribe and no solution to the problem they present, save for war. They will be unlanded, their tribe will be dissolved, and their people will be reforged to follow the law of Degakheion.\n\nOnly then will the bharbhen of Elitbar be safe from their own savagery."
 G46_construct_the_goliath_title: "Construct The Goliath"
 G46_construct_the_goliath_desc: "Through our efforts and the thousands who have fallen in the conquest of Alecand and in the Karkares Upheaval, we have chosen to construct a great monument in the form of a lighttower, one which shall commemorate the fallen and celebrate the standing soldiers, officers, generals and our rulers who have made these things possible. A salute-in-stone to all those who have lived and died for Degakheion, and a beacon for those who will in the future."
 G46_guardian_of_the_kheions_title: "Guardian of The Kheions"
 G46_guardian_of_the_kheions_desc: "Once, the Phylaxana stood watch over all civilisation. Once, they kept order in the Kheions, kept the great mass of the people in line, prosperous and quiet. But then… upheaval. With the Kaydhano came the roiling storm of chaos. Cut off, the wardens fell, one by one. But one group remained. And in Degakheion, we kept that light, that duty. And now?\n\nNow, the Phylaxana stand watch once more. Now, the Phylaxana keep Kheion and Nékheis alike subjugated, safeguarded against riot, against rebellion. Now, the Phylaxana stand as the guardians of the Kheions once more. Wardenship restored – and a duty of reclamation fulfilled. But this is not the end… for our responsibility continues unending. And the Phylaxana must stand vigilant, until the end of time…"
 G46_the_strateodegis_academy_title: "Strateódegis Academy"
 G46_the_strateodegis_academy_desc: "It is an eternal truth that war is an eternal art. And as with any such art, one who practices it can spend a lifetime perfecting it, and yet never have nothing left to learn. For as the practitioner learns, the craft expands, so that the ideal of war can be chased but never grasped.\n\nThis is true of our recent campaigns as well. While we may sneer at the effete weakness of our fellow Kheionai, they have taught us much: in some cases with novel new strategies, and in most cases lessons of what not to do. Let us construct an academy where our lessons may be preserved for the future, so that our sons may benefit from the hard-won knowledge of their fathers."
 G46_secure_the_state_title: "Secure Kheinós"
 G46_secure_the_state_desc: "The deal we made with Oktikheion was simple. We seize Kimánis’ hinterlands with lightning speed, whilst they seize their islands, and blockade their port. Cut off from supply, they would fall, quickly, instantly. We would march in, and together we would share the city. Kimánis surrendered to Oktikheion, as planned – but when we marched to the city, the Oktíbhen shut us out!\n\nNow we are left with the barren lands of Kheinós… but we have not gotten where we are through stewing in our sorrow. The Karkares grow restless – perhaps it is time to throw them a bone, and improve these new lands of ours? After all, a good-enough house, and a life away from their wardens’ watchful eye, may be an admirable pick for some of them. And, in the process, we could gain a few more… loyal auxiliaries."
 G46_thirst_for_iron_title: "Thirst For Iron"
 G46_thirst_for_iron_desc: "It has been said that war needs only the will to wage it. True as this may be, war is one thing, and victory another. Victory in war demands will, yes, but also food, water, good arms and strong hands to shape and wield them.\n\nStrong hands have never been a scarcity in our fair city, but iron is another matter, for our forges seldom sleep, and in feeding them, we have encountered a scarcity of this metal. While scarcity breeds innovation, we are now in control of the slopes of Meteí, a mountain rich in metal of all kinds.\nThe Karkares await our word. Their bloody toil will buy us all the iron that we will ever need."
 G46_philosophical_strengthening_title: "Philosophical Strengthening"
 G46_philosophical_strengthening_desc: "Philosophy courses through every aspect of Kheionai life – and therefore, through the life of each Phylaxana. Traditionally, our guiding philosophy has been the Drivós Rochos, a school that emphasises restraint and moderation in all things, to conserve the pleasures of life in service of a higher goal.\n\nBut in recent centuries, new philosophies have been growing in popularity, such as the Axierophonic Mandate, which emphasises security above all – an idea that strikes true to role as guardians. And now, much more recently, the great Ambhen conqueror Laskaris has proven the strength of his ideals, his determination and purpose inspiring his troops like no other. The Phylaxana are dedicated to standing at the cutting-edge of military philosophy – and some argue for change. Shall we humour them?"
 G46_institute_the_daografi_title: "Institute The Daografí"
 G46_institute_the_daografi_desc: "In every Kheion, the census is vital. How else could you know how much grain to store, how much space is needed within the Windwards, how many you have lost after a bad Kaydhano Deathwind? But in Degakheion, the census is important for a different reason – it counts the Phylaxana, and that means it counts warriors. A glance at a census is a glance at Degakheion’s readiness for war. The resources at the Stratéodeges’ disposal.\n\nOr, at least, that is the ideal. But, as has been discovered, an accurate head-count is no longer good enough. Some Phylaxana suffer from injury, misfortune, general ill-health. Some cannot be spared to leave their manors unattended, for fear of revolt. Some are… unreliable. Morally, or otherwise. Enter: the Daografí. A new form of in-depth, detailed census, a true assessment of the state and status of every Phylaxiate. With the Daografí, we can render support when needed and lighten it when not, focus our efforts, improve recruitment. The Phylaxana will be strengthened in rank like never before!"
 G46_the_drivos_kryphane_title: "The Drivos Kryphane"
 G46_the_drivos_kryphane_desc: "In the chaos of the upheaval, one concession above all was given to the Karkares – the ability to rise above their station, undertake the Erythé, and become a Phylaxiate. This right had been theirs, once, before first convention, and then law, restricted the Erythe to the children of Phylaxana. Meritocratic-stratocracy became aristocratic-stratocracy.\n\nBut no longer – for although there are many who believe it cannot be done, that only the training a Phylaxana-child receives could prepare one to undertake the nightmare-trials of the Red Halls, across Alecand Karkares step forwards to do so. The Drivós Rochos prepares a Phylaxiate – but they claim another path, a hidden path. They call it the Drivós Kryphane."
 G46_allow_the_flow_of_ideas_title: "Voices Unshackled"
 G46_allow_the_flow_of_ideas_desc: "Under the Phylaxana’s watch, the Karkares have remained docile, quiet – when they weren’t in open revolt, that is. Their ideas remained spoken only behind closed doors, in dark corners away from their rulers – when said within earshot, it was hidden in layers of wit and metaphor, a code of feeling only their fellows could parse.\n\nBut things have changed. We can no longer afford the silence of the Karkares – and with that in mind, we must give them a way to express themselves. We must allow the flow of ideas – and to do that, we must establish a council of Karkares, to permit the exchange of ideas between ward and warden. After all, how can you rule a people you know nothing about?"
 G46_reform_the_military_title: "Reform The Military"
 G46_reform_the_military_desc: "The Military had long been under the strict and unyielding control of the Phylaxana, who enforced a strict martial code – while some were assigned to act as officers over Karkares auxiliaries, this was a lesser job. Instead, they focused on fighting as one, in their own, elite units, commanded by strong warriors, and the patriarchs of the great families.\n\nBut the times are changing – and the new spirit of meritocracy has convinced us that we can no longer afford to segregate ourselves from the mass of our soldiery. From now on, the Phylaxana must act as beacons on the battlefield, and our best and brightest must lead, not simply following the Kylakas’ lead, following drill and dogma, but following their own judgement. Meritocracy, installed at the highest levels, and given room to shine."
 G46_prisoners_once_more_title: "Prisoners Once More"
 G46_prisoners_once_more_desc: "Now that we have crushed the Karkares in their feeble attempts to overthrow the state, we are prepared to restore absolute control over the Kheions, and deliver exact justice on those who dared to question our authority and legitimacy. The remnants of the rioters are going to ground, fleeing to the islands and the undercities, shutting themselves in their homes, or hiding in dark corners, all for fear of being exposed to our forces.\n\nBut they cannot run, and they cannot hide. Those who continue to fight will be annihilated, and those who try to avoid their due punishment will receive a far worse one. No matter the cost, we will make the people of Alecand subservient to our will once more."
 G46_ethonaltian_code_title: "Ethonaltian Code"
 G46_ethonaltian_code_desc: "In the 700s, the Kylakas Darathartes faced a Karkares Revolt of his own. He crushed it, as was his duty, but he believed that the expected punishment for the rebels – execution, as they deserved – was a waste. So he did the unthinkable – he innovated. He changed the law code, so that they could be sent to Devand instead as prisoners. Thus arose Deyeion. Thus fell the Old Code.\n\nOr, at least, that is what the hardliners frame it as – but that position has gained traction. Devand is filling up rapidly, what is the use for exile-as-punishment? What is the use, really, for all the wimpy concessions we’ve made over the years. It is said that in the chaos of the Ruin the Phylaxana-King Ethonaltes kept the old law, and preserved its codified form. It is a very bloody code indeed, with death proscribed for most serious crimes, and public punishments abounding. Hanging for thieves, beheading for embezzlers – exactly the severity we need to keep Alecand in order."
 G46_codify_martial_supremacy_title: "Codify Martial Supremacy"
 G46_codify_martial_supremacy_desc: "The institution of the Daografi has shown us an unparalleled clarity when it comes to gauging the readiness of the Phylaxana – and in so doing, it has shown us where we need to improve. The Phylaxana must become unbreakable, unstoppable – and that means we must train relentlessly and intensively, even beyond the Erythe and our normal duties to exercise. Drill must become a routine as common as eating or sleeping, novels must make way for tactical manuals, theatre must give way to history, dancing to sparring, singing to the war-cry. Only through excellence can we truly reign supreme."
 
 #Events
 flavour_degakheion.1.t: "Betrayal on every Front"
 flavour_degakheion.1.d: "The Kylakas and his subordinate watched the trial through the observation window. Red mist permeated the room – wisped around the boy strapped into the chair as he thrashed around, sweat-drenched, face wrenched. They were in the Red Halls, in the bowels of Degakheion – and the elf before them was undertaking a trial-by-nightmare. “Will he pass?” The Kylakas asked, turning to his subordinate. “He is on his sixth, yes?”\n\nThe subordinate crossed his arms. “He’s rallied before, even if he struggles in the trial itself. He has made it this far… but the seventh, I am not sure.” The Kylakas nodded – the two watched in silence as the trial came to an end, the mist cleared, the boy awoke. His eyes flew open; he started breathing hard, heavy. But the boy steeled himself, even as his body trembled. Tears streamed down his face, but he did not cry out. He kept calm. Collected. As a Phylaxana should. He did not say a word as he was unstrapped and led out. But the Kylakas stayed even beyond his departure, watched the empty chamber. “Did you have another question, sir?”\n\n“Do you think we are strong enough?” The Kylakas asked. There were many boys and girls undertaking the Erythe – the strict training regimen that prepared one for the Red Halls. To be shown – to feel – the worst horrors imaginable as if they were real. To overcome the fear, and become a Phylaxana. But the challenges that Degakheion faced… “We have trusted in our strength, and our courage, and our training. Prepared our lives for war. And now it draws near.” Treacherous Oktikheion in the north, the gilded swindlers of Ormam in the south. Alecand needed the guidance of the old codes, now more than ever. “But can we win, I wonder?”\n\nThe general remained silent – they both looked to the chamber both of them had been forged in. Finally, Rhadinos pressed a hand to the glass, and spoke. “They do not have this. Drill. Discipline.” He turned to his commander again. “When we were wardens, that was enough…”"
 flavour_degakheion.1.a: "...and now, as conquerors, it shall be again!"
 flavour_degakheion.2.t: "Pirates Captured"
 flavour_degakheion.2.d: "When Kimánis was partitioned and Oktikheion seized the city itself, all expected Amgremós to submit to their new overlords, as was precedent – as was law. They didn’t. Instead, emboldened by the success of Ameion in the east, they scrambled to seek support from wherever they could find it. And, to their shame, they found it in the pirates of the Cleaved Sea. Amgremós grew fat by picking off the trade ships bringing Taychend’s riches to the Kheionai. They dared to think that their independence could last – Oktíbhen incompetence means it might have. But we are not Oktikheion.\n\nNow, the captured pirates of the Andic Reach sat confined in pens, under Phylaxana watch – with the aid of guards from loyal Eneion. The operations had been difficult, far ranging. At every turn, the pirates had proven their skill-at-sea, a certain pluckiness on land. There are some, in our Nékheis, who begrudgingly respect them – but the Phylaxana can afford them no such thing. They are criminals, nothing more.\n\nThe law code gives us two options – death, or heavy labour in Deyeion, a holdover from the innovation of Darasthartes. There are some, though, who see another option. A loophole, one may say. Rather than having them waste away in tea plantations, we could put them to sea, in a state of “indefinite transit” to Deyeion. Most, as galley slaves, some, perhaps slightly more. Not officers, of course – but advisors. Trade on their minds, to protect the seas… and learn some of their tactics. It will be useful to our naval hegemony, no doubt.\n\nThere are some who call this a vile innovation, tantamount to treason against the Old Law. Perhaps both can be true. Or maybe the thought alone is treason-of-the-mind. If so? The penalty for piracy is death-by-hanging. And the gallows await our command."
 flavour_degakheion.2.a: "Let’s send them to Deyeion… on a very long trip."
 flavour_degakheion.2.b: "Criminals can't be trusted, off to the gallows with them."
 flavour_degakheion.3.t: "An Eye For An Eye"
 flavour_degakheion.3.d: "Ormam and Oktikheion – self-proclaimed masters of the sea! One with hers eyes only on accumulation, stacking her coins high for the sake of it, making trouble to turn a profit… the other spending frivolously on naval adventure, gorging herself on the pleasures of the flesh, the sweetness of sugar. And they wonder why we look down on them so? Why, when they try to dominate those who by law are their rightful masters, we respond with such methods?” The Kylakas gestured to the political leaders of the conquered cities, nooses tied round their necks. “Why we do not answer indignity and disgrace with a whimper and yowl – why we answer it with an eye for an eye!”\n\nThe ranks of the Phylaxana were assembled before him, the veterans of Degakheion’s ascent. Centuries ago, Ormam had taken advantage of plague and catastrophe to subjugate them, ensnaring them in debt. Oktikheion had always been a thorn in the side – but Kimánis was the last straw. And now, it had all been made right. The Kylakas smiled, as he raised his arms, asked the gathered soldiery: “So tell me, wardens, warriors – WHY?”\n\nThe crowd answered as one: “IT! IS! JUSTICE!” The Kylakas smiled, and waved to the executions. Wood sprang open, ropes snapped taught – and necks cracked, in perfect synchrony. The Kylakas turned back to the crowd. “But there are more than these… profligates out there. Across the subjugated kheions, the merchant-lords, the sugar-traders, the silk-hucksters, they whisper discontent in the dark – they dream of so-called-freedom! If we do not act now – do to them what they would have done to us – order will doubtless give way to chaos! So what will it be, warriors? Will you let treason and plot fester, grow and spread, like a cancer of the Kaydhano?! Or will you CUT IT OUT?!”"
 flavour_degakheion.3.a: "And the Phylaxana saluted their assent once more."
 flavour_degakheion.4.t: "Returned Guardianship"
 flavour_degakheion.4.d: "Every Phylaxiate knows the stories, the history. Of how their ancestors used to protect every Kheion, presiding over an age of order, peace, stability. How the phenomenon of Karkares and Phylaxana – of prisoner and warden – was not one limited to Degakheion, but found in each city, the populations in perfect harmony. Then order broke down, and the other Kheions were consumed by chaos and strife. But in Degakheion, we survived. We kept the old laws. We kept the old ways. We kept our watch.\n\nAnd, when the opportunity presented itself, we struck. Campaign after campaign, hard fought, hard won. Through discipline, through unity, through strength. And at last, Alecand is ours.\n\nWe will never be able to render the citizens of the other Kheions the same status as the Karkares at home, but that is of little matter – no matter the political pretensions of our subjects, the Degabhen garrisons stationed in their cities remind them of what true power is. The Phylaxana – the tip of the spear, the best of the best, readied by regimen and honed through the Erythé – stand as the guardians of civilisation, the spear-spiked shield of the Kheionai.\n\nAlready, they were beginning to dream of grander things still, plan future campaigns abroad, grand infrastructural works, political plans. And, of course, enjoy the fruits of their duty.\n\nWardens once more. And both guard and prisoner will prosper under our guidance!"
 flavour_degakheion.4.a: "Our guardianship will never be challenged again!"
 flavour_degakheion.5.t: "Goliath Constructed"
 flavour_degakheion.5.d: "The Goliath was a marvel-in-stone, a grand lighthouse standing tall against the blue of the coast – and, amidst a Kaydhano, the blue of a storm. At the foot of the tower was a mountain of stone, statues of toiling, grasping Karkares rough-cut into it, scrambling towards the Goliath’s base to support their protectors. There, at the tower’s bottom, were the wardens-of-the-home, mothers, wives, aged veterans, who guarded the manor-house while their husbands or children fought and protected, who reared and trained the next generation. But they only supported the real focus of the monument – thousands of warrior-statues, mostly male but many female too, charged forth on a massive, uphill ascent clockwise around the Goliath, a curling battleline-in-profile.\n\nThe face of each warrior was blank, smooth stone. Of course they were – they were not individuals. The Goliath was not an individual – it was the Phylaxana. The embodiment of all those who had been, all those who would be. Since the dawn of history, and to the end of it.\n\nAtop the Goliath was a massive bowl of olive oil. A beacon against the black of night, the darkness of disorder. The ascent up the tower – one-handed up a great steel-cast ladder, grip tight on the lit torch in his right hand – was torturous. But he was no stranger to it. Prepared through pain, forged in nightmare, honed through drill, refined through bloody trauma. He finally reached the pinnacle – looked back, at the city of Degakheion, standing tall, standing proud, prosperous, protected. And the warriors that guarded it – guarded civilisation itself – below, in perfect rank, spear-and-shield held to salute. He smiled, at a duty renewed, and a responsibility restored, and touched the flame of his torch to the oil – a flash of light, a roaring flame…"
 flavour_degakheion.5.a: "…and the beacon of subjugation shone for all to see."
 flavour_degakheion.6.t: "The Finishing Touches"
 flavour_degakheion.6.d: "The Phylaxana stood alongside representatives from other Kheions as they watched the Karkares be strapped in to the chair from the observation room. Somehow, he appeared calm. None had believed he would have gotten this far – not so quickly, anyway. It took an aspirant child years to undertake all seven trials. This adult elf had done it in weeks. Nightmare after nightmare, the worst terrors imaginable made real to the mind. And he just shrugged it off.\n\nThe Phylaxana strapping him in finished up, hurried out. They closed the door – and a chanted spell, a flare of channelled magic, and the Red Mist descended. It took about thirty minutes for the trial to be over – the elf trembled, drenched in sweat, face scrunched up, as he no doubt experienced incomprehensible pain, torment.\n\nHe awoke. They saw him clutch at his head, breathing hard, eyes clamped shut, as the mist cleared. But he did not thrash, did not scream. On the second, he had, and the fifth. But the only requirement for trials one to six was to get back into the chamber once more. To face the nightmare again, and again, and again. On the seventh, though, you must talk. Swear your oath, no matter how hard you trembled, shook.\n\nAnd he did, and so the Kylakas anointed him a Phylaxiate, before the watching crowd. There were cheers from the representatives – stunned, astonished silence from the Phylaxana. The Kylakas, too. But he was thankful, in a way, that his reforms had brought fruit. “What did you see, on the seventh?” He asked him. “It is portentous, to some.”\n“My daughter, beaten to death in front of me.” The Karkares-Phylaxiate replied, smiling despite his words. “I had to watch. But it did not trouble me. The last time I watched her die, you bastards murdered her for real.”"
 flavour_degakheion.6.a: "The rock turned, the hidden path reveals itself. Not drill, but experience."
 flavour_degakheion.7.t: "Days of Torment"
 flavour_degakheion.7.d: "“Hail, Kylakas – my report in writing, as requested.\n\nThe Kheions have been definitively pacified now. Street fighting of course ceased weeks ago, but even beyond that, the organisation that supported the riots has been definitively crushed. Raids in Arpedifér’s western district, the north dockyards of Ormam, and in “Section Októ” of Lokemeion’s Grand Library destroyed their last remaining supplies of weapons, and with the riot-leaders “Váithos”, “Súalides” and “Kenaktízos” killed over the past week, we’re certain the rebel leadership has been decapitated.\n\nThey should be incapable of further action, though that isn’t a guarantee. We will need to gauge the strength of their operations in Cósan first – I’ve sent three galleys and a contingent of Phylaxana for the purpose. The island nonetheless remains under our control – this is more investigative.\n\nAs for the captive leadership, the last were publicly executed last week. The recruiter “Chraméas” made a scene on the gallows, which should diminish his reputative-legacy going forwards, a boon for containing any further organisation in Kimánis. Concerning the rank-and-file, post-mortem crucifixion as you suggested has worked brilliantly. A perfect mix between showing consequence and limiting potential for responsive unrest. I’ve sent word that this be replicated elsewhere. Once those are confirmed, the prison population should have returned to pre-revolt levels by the end of the year.\n\nAs for the general mood, the Karkares seem to have given our operations a name of their own: “the Days of Torment.” I would advise against using this in anything official – but I don’t believe it should be suppressed generally, either. It is said with fear, not indignant outrage. I think the Karkares will be pacified for quite some time yet.\n\n– signed, A. Genepátheras, Stratéodegis, Garrison-Command”"
 flavour_degakheion.7.a: "Then it is done – the Great Karkares revolt is over!"

 #Karkares Upheaval Event Chain
 flavour_degakheion.9.t: "Karkares Upheavel!"
 flavour_degakheion.9.d: "Negligence. How else could one describe it? It was criminal, the Kylakas knew, as he studied the map before him, contemplated the reports. It was criminal, and it would be punished. He turned to his subordinate general, spoke over the faint din of discontent from outside. “And none of our garrisons have fallen?”\n\nThe general nodded. “We hold their Oúraskheions, their ward-generators. Barracks, defensive strongpoints on the walls. The rest?” He crossed his arms, smirked slightly. “Some upheaval, I think.” The Kylakas chuckled at that, despite it all. Upheaval, of course, was code for total, catastrophic disaster. This would be called the Great Karkares Revolt, no doubt… it had not yet escalated to open war, but in Degakheion the Karkares were in uproar, and in the other Kheions mob and magnate stood side-by-side against the rule of the Phylaxana. Clearly, the administration had become overstretched… the Phylaxana had grown too lax. And now, all they had built threatened to collapse before them.\n\nThe Kylakas shook his head, took in the map again. No… it wasn’t so bad as that. There were probably a hundred thousand angry Kheionai fighting to take his head, sure, but the Phylaxana remained firm. Unbowed… they would rally, put the Karkares back in their place. And then… enforce the ancient law, as it was intended, as was their duty. Crush the Karkares, execute any in the subject cities who stood against Degakheion’s lawful rule.\n\nAnd repeat this same thing next century. Or in the next fifty years. Or next decade. If they meant to stand watch forever… could they really continue as they are? The law codes had been changed before. Through blood, and pain, and sacrifice. But they had been changed. The Kylakas looked to his general again – a proud and skilled warrior, of noble blood. As was he, as were most of his soldiers. Lineage was a bound, a bond. Aristocracy meant stability. They had made that law. Perhaps, the Kylakas wondered, it would be best if it was unmade? And perhaps this was the perfect crucible of blood, pain and sacrifice to do it?"

 flavour_degakheion.9.b: "If we give one inch, the Karkares will take a mile. Crush them without recourse!"
 flavour_degakheion.10.t: "Winds of Change"
 flavour_degakheion.10.d: "“Treason!” A phylaxiate called. “Turning our backs on the old code!” said another. “Defiling our duty, our traditions!” “Tantamount to emancipation!” There were opposing shouts too, in the chaos of the Oúraspíthion. “A necessary change!” “The only way forwards!” “A measured response, not defilement!”\n\nThe Kylakas sat in his chair, face fixed to a snarl, as he listened to the discontent, the disquiet, the jeers and counter-jabs. He had barely passed this through the Genétholyklos – and only after one of the great Kylakas families had stormed out. That the Phylaxana could be so blind, so foolish – they called his designs offensive, treasonous, but it was they who would abandon the realm to the Karkares, if it meant keeping one of their blood from ascending to the Phylaxana.\n\nSuddenly, he stood, roared “QUIET!” The chamber simmered for but a moment – he seized the pause. “You speak of treason– but what do I hear from you all? Talk of mutiny, revolt, rebellion! The winds of change are strong, Phylaxana! And if you can believe it, when the storm was so great before– at the Isolation, when our brother-wardens were struck down by revolt, we did not survive by guarding our ranks! This is a change, and it has done NAUGHT for us! If a Karakeres passes the trials, they are WORTHY! By tenacity and courage, if not by blood!”\n\nThen a commotion – the noble family that had stormed out of the earlier meeting had came back in, brandishing weapons. Their leader stepped forwards, spear in hand. “LIES!” He called. “LIES AND SLANDER! Against the name of the Phylaxana, against our duty, against the LAW! You may not see it, but to us, it is plain as day! This is a CONCESSION!” Then, he threw his spear to the ground before him. “Take this!” He snarled."

 flavour_degakheion.11.t: "Returning Normalcy"
 flavour_degakheion.11.d: "The last of the rebels was led up to the block, hands tied behind his back. The rest of his comrades were piled in a cart some ways away, headless. There were no spectators in the square, no audience – this was not an execution of a Karkares, after all. The Kylakas watched, gripping spear and shield – still at war. The rebel Phylaxiate looked up to him as he was kicked to his knees. Eyes fixed on him still as his head was forced to the block. “Traitor.” He said. And then swing, swish, thud. The head rolled into a box set below. Someone carried it away, then the body. The cart was covered, and left. The Kylakas nodded solemnly, turned to a fellow warrior standing beside him, and gave him his weapons.\n\nThen, the warrior left too, and the Kylakas was alone. Warden against warden, brother against brother, blood against blood… the fighting had been intense. Emotional, in more ways than a battle usually brought. When he had taken the Erythé, faced the red mists of nightmare, he had experienced the feeling of hurting someone close to you. The Dream had made him slip a dagger in his brother – feel his flesh give way, watch the life drain from his eyes, know the pain, the regret, as if it was real. As he awoke from the mist, he had rallied his brutalised psyche, convinced him that it was a hypothetical, a dim possibility. Nothing more. He had killed three brothers, now.\n\nTomorrow, the state of extraordinary war would be lifted. Normalcy returned… with a change. The preparations were being made. Soon, the first Karkares would take the trials. Some said it was certain they would fail. But he thought differently. The second memory in his mind was a scene from his youth. Real, no nightmare. A dissident Karkares he'd run through with his spear. His child sitting near, watching, dull-eyed. If illusion could prepare oneself for reality…"
 flavour_degakheion.11.a: "…then could reality not better prepare for nightmare?"
 flavour_degakheion.12.t: "The Greatest Riot"
 flavour_degakheion.12.d: "The rebel leaders sat around the table, the mood grave, dire. Months of protests, unrest, rousing the people from their slumber – decades of preparation before then, as their Phylaxiate overlords went to war, ignored the trouble brewing at home. And now, the time had come… judgement, on whether it would all be for nothing.\n\n“So the signal is out?” One asked. “The other cities will rise, on the same day, or there-abouts?”\n\nAnother nodded. “Simultaneous attacks on the garrison’s positions, before they can reinforce. Local elites, merchants and mercenaries… hah, even some pirates. We should have enough to make a dent.”\n\n“But to overthrow them?” One of the leaders – a wealthy Karkares woman from Degakheion’s northern district – sat forwards, worried lines on her face. “My district… we transported weapons under the guise of gladiators… but we have nothing heavy. Substantial. And the peasants in the countryside… how will we get them into the Kheions, to aid us?”\n\nNobody answered. Silence, for a few moments. Finally, one spoke up. “It doesn’t matter.” He shook his head. “They’ve refused any concessions, as we predicted. It is now or never. Every day we wait, their grip grows stronger. We have no other choice.” The woman’s face fell for a moment – but then the courage came back. She nodded.\n\n“So it is done, then? Should we go, to our districts?” A murmured agreement. “Then good luck, everyone. Kill as many of the warden-bastards as you can.”"
 flavour_degakheion.12.a: "And the Great Karkares Revolt begins."
 flavour_degakheion.13.t: "The People, Subdued"
 flavour_degakheion.13.d: "The Kylakas walked between Degakheion’s packed tenements. The fight had ended a small while ago. Dead bodies littered the streets, limp, lifeless, blood pooling beneath them. Some in groups, some alone. Some cut down as they fled, some still clutching the weapons in their hands. Pitchforks, butcher-knives, ramshackle-spears. A few captured swords. None had armour.\n\nA heavy toll. But he supposed that was the price of sticking to the old code. The prisoners subdued. Half of them slaughtered to do it. And the riot squashed.\n\nThen, something caught the Kylakas’ eye. He halted, raised his brow. A woman – dead, of course – clutched a… rod? It was like a metal pole. Not a weapon, really. A stick. She’d been cut down… fallen on her back. And in the blood beside her, there were… little footprints. Marks where someone had knelt. His first thought was that it was her child. Curious. The blood still fresh, but when the Kylakas looked around him, he couldn’t see anyone. What sort of child abandons his dead mother? Leaves her corpse in an alley? Maybe he’d ran off, was cut down as well.\n\nMmm… no, not a good excuse. The Kylakas turned to the woman again – stared at the footprints. He remembered, now… one of the Erythé trials. One of the nightmares. The mist had shown him… well, something had killed his mother, basically. A wolf or something. And he’d watched it happen, heard the screams, terror, wails et cetera et cetera. It was hunting him… he’d had to stay still. Let it happen. But the monster passed, and he went to his mother’s side. He’d stayed by her for a while. He was sure that he had. And then it came round again. He remembered its gnashing maw tearing into him. The unimaginable pain. It ate him. He felt it.\n\nHe’d stayed. What sort of child abandons his dead mother? The Kylakas gave a dour sigh, shook his head, and continued on his walk."
