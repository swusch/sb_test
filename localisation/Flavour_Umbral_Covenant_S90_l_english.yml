Normally the messenger would not leave the shadows alive, but this one had news that delighted the Coven: The Umbral Covenant has been signed. With it the Night Hags have released their most powerful pawn into the prime material plane: the Vile One. A being of terrifying power, raised by the Coven from when she was a child, she has been created as a tool to guide the people of Sarhal to assist in our end goal: full unification of the shadow plane with the prime material plane.\n\nWith Yezel Mora on one side and The Vile One on the other, soon all of Sarhal will fall beneath our shadow!"
