 gushuokguan_1_2_desc:0 "Gushuokguan is no state built on the personal ambitions of kings or dictators; it is instead built on the dreams and hopes of the peasantry, who strive to build an honourable and decent life within the borders of our “stone republic”. All who come to our nation are given a second chance to carve out their own slice of paradise through cooperation and hard work. We can support these new brethren by building workshops or developing more land for agricultural exploitation. Let us embrace all who seek freedom and prosperity; together we march to prosperity, together we shall make the future bright!"
 gushuokguan_1_3_title:0 "Supplying the Stone Army"
 gushuokguan_1_3_desc:0 "Our freestate of fortune grows, and so does our “associate fighting force”. The Stone Armies will need more supplies and materials if they are to keep up their formidable reputation in lands far away and to maintain their honour and high reputation among local populations. Setting up supply centres all over the realm will ensure a steady supply of goods, foods and materials to the armies fighting abroad."
 gushuokguan_1_4_title:0 "Dawn Upon the Yan"
 gushuokguan_1_4_desc:0 "Our ability to spread the philosophy of liberty for everyone, everywhere comes not only from our recent wars of liberation, but just as well from our commitment to the actual economic uplifting of the territories we bring under our control. We rule not because we want to dominate, but because we want to liberate, in all forms!\n\nLet us transform the Yan into a beacon of prosperity and peace, and have the people rest easy and live free."
 gushuokguan_1_6_title:0 "The Rock Raiders"
 gushuokguan_1_6_desc:0 "Where most in Yanshen see the birdriders as nothing more than uncivilized harbingers of terror and death, we see mobile combat units that can operate almost completely autonomously, wreaking havoc upon hostile armies through hit and run tactics and raiding parties. As our Dao on the steppe yearns to prove itself an equal to us, we shall give them this opportunity!"

 gushuokguan_1_8_desc:0 "When we merged the stratocrats of Hubao with the dragon warriors of Bianfang, we created a war machine like none before. Mixing the combat prowess of the harimari with the dragonking knowledge of “ordnance and fire” has led to the formation of the Dacite Dragons. This crack force specializes in shelling enemy formations with a thunderous roar of artillery before charging and crushing the disorganized and panicking mass before them. We are going to fetch a very good price abroad for these men, as more and more rulers crave gunpowder in their armies to one up each other."

 gushuokguan_2_1_title:0 "Republic of Forts"
 gushuokguan_2_1_desc:0 "The region we call home has for time immemorial been nothing more than a buffer zone between more powerful republics, kingdoms and other polities. Their vain attempts to secure the area resulted in a large number of fortifications being built, though many were abandoned as quickly as they were built. A more recent power vacuum has given rise to the formation of Gushuokguan, a state that can be better described as a collection of dilapidated forts with villages surrounding it, Gushibi being the largest of these. Asserting our independence can only be achieved if we are willing to rebuild and improve the existing fortifications and defensive structures that dot our land. Let our land enjoy prosperity and fortitude under the protection of these mighty stone guardians."
 gushuokguan_2_2_title:0 "A Solid Stone Foundation"
 gushuokguan_2_2_desc:0 "The Stone Army has, through its strict principles of honour and decency, built up a reputation which reaches far and wide. It is the premier Yan mercenary company and contracting them means that you gain not only an experienced army, but one that will honour your contract until the bitter end. We should strengthen the Stone Army even further by building a large army base near the capital, centralising its command and offering its leaders a close link with the realm’s diplomatic corps. The Stone Army will be able to improve itself under the watchful eye of the state and the state will ensure the continued stream of revenue from these mercenary exploits abroad."
 gushuokguan_2_3_title:0 "A Company With a State"
 gushuokguan_2_3_desc:0 "We live in strange times. For ages, kings and other autocratic rulers alike relied mostly on levies or mercenaries to do their fighting for them, though they were always on edge, as an unpaid or underpaid mercenary company could at any moment become a king's greatest foe, ruining their realm more than any enemy could ever dream of. But in Gushuokguan, we embraced mercenaries and gave them a home which they would never dream of burning down. To help the Stone Armies gain new recruits and tie them ever further to our realm, we will build conscription offices and training grounds for them. We are the Stone Army and they are us!"
 gushuokguan_2_4_title:0 "Armed with Expertise"
 gushuokguan_2_4_desc:0 "Our armies are home to a motley crew of experts from different fields, whether they be personal combat experts, artillery engineers or stablemasters. These men come from all walks of life and realms of Haless, giving us access to a cache of military knowledge rivalling that of the Command. Many of these specialists also served across Haless as mercenaries and military diplomats, giving them what some call the “swagger of a sellsword”, a way of acting careless, confident and charismatic in the presence of both the common folk and the elite. This “swagger” has become a staple of Gushuokguan diplomacy. As such our nation has a diplomatic corps well-versed in the languages, customs and etiquette of the continent."
 gushuokguan_2_5_title:0 "Subsidiary Swords"
 gushuokguan_2_5_desc:0 "We work not to enrich a landlord or king but to improve the lot of our own lives and those of our children. All across our grand confederation of Dao, the people enjoy prosperity at their own hands. They sow the seeds of prosperity and reap the fruits of their own labour. They build up this great society through hard work and dedication to the freedom and equality which our realm provides. We must now take measures to protect this newfound prosperity by protecting the worker from foreign merchants who try to steal away the wealth of the common folk by exploiting our greater fondness of freedom."
 gushuokguan_2_7_title:0 "For Freedom, Not For Free"
 gushuokguan_2_7_desc:0 "We have, through hardship, learned that the freedom we crave is not free. In fact it can be seen as the most expensive commodity that exists. If one does not take care of it, it will wither like leaves in the soil and if one discards its use, then one will soon enough yearn for it like nothing else. Likewise, if we take the freedom of others, we make ourselves moral prisoners of the oppressors once more. We offer freedom to our brethren and to those who ask for it, yet to pay for the costs we shall need their cooperation and expertise in combat. Like us they will learn that to gain freedom is not free, yet worth the cost!"
 gushuokguan_2_8_title:0 "Whetstones of the Forest"
 gushuokguan_2_8_desc:0 "The tea terraces and jungles of the south have proven to be one of the most unfriendly types of terrain for our enemies. While the jungle takes most soldiers through sickness and pestilence, our denizens of the foliage pick off the enemy through tactics of hit and run and the use of the jungle as a natural cover. Enemy soldiers fear the forests, as they could be snatched and killed by an enemy at every moment. Naturally this has led to many rulers coveting soldiers who can fight in these conditions and use their surroundings, as they make for the perfect defensive force. And so we have, as the market demands, created an army of guerilla experts who will defend the forests and jungles of our customers as they do their own home."

 gushuokguan_3_1_title:0 "An Alliance of Convenience"
 gushuokguan_3_1_desc:0 "While we hold no ideology sacred, we cannot deny that our principles - freedom for the peasantry and liberty for those who seek it - are similar to those of the Blue Scarf Rebels in Lanjinhui. An alliance might be beneficial to both of us, as both our states seek the respect or at least recognition of our neighbouring states to ensure the survival of our polities. Whether we ally ourselves to the Blue Scarfs or condemn them, we must act soon!"
 gushuokguan_3_2_title:0 "Long Awaited Exercise"
 gushuokguan_3_2_desc:0 "Our relation with Lanjinhui is stable, though it could be even more so if they were to come under our watchful guard. They are still beset by hostiles all around, and a single realm could eliminate these brave blue-scarfed peasants in one fell swoop, forever crushing their hopes for freedom and prosperity. We cannot let this happen and thus must act as an elder brother who will protect its little sibling from harm, even if we may have to do so through less peaceful methods. They shall see the light eventually, and march alongside us to a better future!"
 gushuokguan_3_4_title:0 "The Interior Dao"
 gushuokguan_3_4_desc:0 "The interior of Yanshen is dominated by its namesake, the Yan river. It flows from the Serpentspine all the way to Tianlou and is the main artery of trade, culture and life through the mainland of Yanshen. We must and shall control it, for not only are its denizens owed freedom and prosperity, but without them we have no way of securing our economic future. The Yanszin cities shall be an economic boon to our confederation, while Hubao will become our western bastion upon which the Command will break itself."
 gushuokguan_3_6_title:0 "The Chrome Claws"
 gushuokguan_3_6_desc:0 "While the harimari in other realms have elevated themselves above the rest, in Gushuokguan they stand equal to every other race. They are noble, yes, but no nobility. They are natural warriors indeed, though no better than our stone veterans. In our lands they are equal and have been liberated from the expectations that were set upon them by their Raheni kin. Here they are truly free to be who they want to be, which in the case of the Chrome Claws means to be a defender of liberty for all and to yearn for the liberation of all of their brethren from the yoke of the past."

 gushuokguan_3_8_desc:0 "While one might not think the mercantile people of Yanszin particularly adept at mounted combat, the peddlers have a surprise in store. Almost all merchants who work in trade in Yanszin learn to ride a horse from a very young age, assisting their families in peddling, transportation and message delivery from the moment they can stay on the saddle. We can harness this high manoeuvrability and assemble a fighting force that specializes in flanking and fighting. Such a force’s high degree of flexibility and manoeuvring will prevent the enemy from enclosing them or being able to fend them off effectively. "

 gushuokguan_4_1_title:0 "The Republic of Scrolls"
 gushuokguan_4_1_desc:0 "Our realm is officially ruled from Gushibi and officially it is ruled by the eunuchs. In practice, however, these eunuchs differ a lot from their counterparts in Tianlou or the Yan Republics. The eunuchs of Gushuokguan are a motley group of capable yet lost refugees who fled their former realms after persecution, war or scheming gone wrong. They lack the political power to form a fifth column or overly powerful group in society, though they are anything but useless. Most of our veterans and peasants lack any knowledge of statecraft, so a proposal has been put forward by the town councils of Gushuokguan to create a constitution that will give the eunuchs a strong position in ruling the state, in exchange for their undying loyalty and devotion to the principles of the realm. A new Oath will be written, which will be upheld by soldiers, peasants and eunuchs alike."
 gushuokguan_4_2_title:0 "Securing the North"
 gushuokguan_4_2_desc:0 "To our north are the keepers of the eternal flame, who have, through a web of plotting and treachery, been able to usurp full control over the Jiantsiang state and are now effectively its absolute rulers. They plan not only to put down the revolts in their southern territories, but to use the unrest to conquer the entire region, including our freestate! We must turn the tide and bring an end to the oppressors of northern Yanshen."

 gushuokguan_4_3_desc:0 "For a long time now, our people have dreamt of peace, prosperity and freedom, and we have now created a realm in which these dreams hold true. We find strength in our union with Lanjinhui and with the help of the Stone Armies we protect our newly achieved rights. But we are not done yet.\n\nWe could stay dormant, renting out our Stone Armies to foreign rulers and building a small safe haven in the north of Yanshen, or we could build something greater, something more. Why keep our freedom and peace just to ourselves when there are millions in Yanshen who would, just like us, rise up to defend their liberty if called upon? Why would we hoard our prosperity when we can use it to pull our Yanshen brethren out of misery and poverty? We must march on the tyrants of the Yanshen and cast them down. We shall free the Yan and establish a federation of brotherly nations, bound by their desire for liberty and their hatred of tyranny. Forward brethren, for the masses of Yanshen must be liberated!"

These are both realms with a potential which they have yet to reach and under our banner, they shall become beacons of prosperity. Besides this, their ships will protect our shores and grant us access to seas and lands beyond."

 gushuokguan_4_6_title:0 "Seven Swords Society"
 gushuokguan_4_6_desc:0 "The Seven Swords Society - formally the Society for the Care of the Seven Virtues of the Stone Armies of the Free Lands of Yanshen - is an organization that was founded with the expressed mission to take care of veterans in our lands and those of our brethren. They help soldiers with scars of the mind find peace, soldiers with wounds that will never heal pick up a normal life and soldiers who are lost find the path back. On top of that, they have recently started with guiding young officers to become better leaders, though this has as of yet happened only outside of the normal officer training. They request that we support them in their endeavour by officially sanctioning their mentorships and allowing them access to the academies; they also wish to become an official part of officers’ training. This way they can mentor and support newly elected officers, preventing common mistakes made by new officers and passing on valuable knowledge to the new generations."
 gushuokguan_4_7_title:0 "The Code of Lubei"
 gushuokguan_4_7_desc:0 "The incident at the famous Jade Pub has led the officer corps of the Federation to consider stricter rules of conduct for its men. Plundering and living off the land have already long been outlawed and are those who break the rules punished for it harshly. But this has seemingly not been enough to stop our potential customers from deeming their own citizens to be more reliable soldiers than our “motley gang of arrogant rabble-rousers”. We must stop this move to so-called “standing armies” and show our customers that we are still the best option when it comes to fighting wars. Commander Lubei has offered to create a code of conduct based on the rules he has already implemented in his own combat unit, and claimed that these have proven to be very effective in boosting both their reputation and reliability."

We are equals and have come to rescue the people from oppression and injustice, and are bound by our honour to show this to the common people. We invest heavily in our own lands and those of our fellow freeholds. No matter the cost, we shall overcome the initial struggle to convince the local populace and uplift the lands of all the Yanshen. Let us turn the entirety of the Yanshen into a paradise on Halann."
 gushuokguan_5_5_title:0 "A More Perfect Union"
 gushuokguan_5_5_desc:0 "When we created the concept of the Dao we thought of them as almost completely independent: brothers who live in another house, though in the same village, and who stand next to each other in defence of liberty and equality. Yet even this growing village needs a way to govern itself, resolve conflict and if necessary correct mistakes made by its own denizens. It is therefore time to create a council which will oversee matters that surpass the Dao themselves: defense, international diplomacy or overseas trade interests. We shall also use this opportunity to boost the economies of our fellow brethren by investing in each other's lands and sharing our knowledge, leading to a more perfect union in Yanshen."
 gushuokguan_5_6_title:0 "United We Stand"
 gushuokguan_5_6_desc:0 "The Yan flows like a golden thread through the land once more. Free from the oppression of nobility, autocrat or monarch.

Certainly there are only better times ahead…"
 gushuokguan_5_7_title:0 "The Federal Concord"
 gushuokguan_5_7_desc:0 "The golden flow was a mere reflection it seems, a mirage, a phantom. When we attempted to truly unite the peoples of the Yan we found out that they were not ready for this yet. Alas we have fought, and through this a decision was made regarding the future of our confederation. We are still brothers; even brothers fight sometimes, after all. It hurts, a lot in fact, yet through this we have learned that we must listen to each other and that without a united goal we risk becoming a broken family. So let us now rebuild our lands, tend to our wounds and mend the relations between the Dao, for fighting each other will only spell doom for us all and risk what we have built up in all these years."

Though our ideologies seem similar, we are very much opposed to the semi-religious undertone we perceive in the Blue Scarves and are very much against the rowdy masses ruling without any form of structure.

Yet…\n\nThe fools have rejected our promise of friendship, unity and cooperation and they are slowly finding out what an unwise decision this was.

As our Stone Army rented itself out to more and more customers, they became famous for two things: first of all their prowess in combat, which was, unlike many other mercenary or adventurer groups, organized and disciplined. The second was their sense of honour, as during their employment they refrained from plundering local peasants and instead bought provisions or hunted and gathered on their own. This has led them to becoming very respected by the many who have encountered them. They even let peasants drafted into service by their opponents go home, recognising that these men did not choose to fight.\n\nThe exploits of the Stone Army have therefore led our nation to become more respected by our neighbours, especially the republics who, just like us, despise the monarchic warlords of Yanshen."

First of all, it seems that the peasants republic is led by the peasants in name only and that a secret council rules from behind the scenes, evermore drawing power to itself. The second is that the economy of Lanjinhui is still recovering from the revolt against Jiangdu, as many fields, farms and lives were lost during the uprising of the Blue Scarves. All of this means that we can take over the country with relative ease, if we can take down the council.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n\nFirst we will link up with collaborators inside the city, who will let us inside the inner city where the council resides. After this we will have to move quickly, getting rid of the guards on the bell towers to prevent the raising of the alarms, all the while also taking out those who are loyal to the council. After we take the council prisoner, we will force them to accept our guidance and the formation of a political union as our equal. We will allow those who swear loyalty to us to remain in power while dispatching those who oppose the liberation and protection we offer them.

After this we will demand the subordination of Lanjinhui, which we do not expect to be accepted, though in case they do accept, march in anyways to dispatch of anyone who opposes. In case they do not accept, we will march into their lands and take control as quickly as possible.

And it was in this hall that the men of Gushibi had sworn an oath of protection to the community, to the people and to the ancestors. From today, this new oath would start to be moulded into shape.\n\nWhile all estates agreed that a new oath and set of basic laws were to be made, what those should be was still up in the air. They did however agree on a few basic principles, which would guide this realm of downtrodden peasants, refugees of war and exiles of intrigue.\n\nFirst of all there was the Principle of Freedom: all inhabitants of Gushuokguan were free to believe as they wished and to practise their cultural practices without obstruction, for as long as one did not harm the other.\n\nThe Second was the Principle of Balance: this principle proclaimed that power was to be split between the different estates and powers within Gushuokguan. The eunuchs wanted to retain their control over the bureaucracy, while the Stone Army’s commanders wished to remain in control of the armed forces, all while the peasants wished to gain more influence over the governing of the realm.\n\nThird came the Principle of Service: Whether one was a peasant who delivered tons of grain to market, a eunuch who kept the administration running or a soldier protecting the realm, one who lived in Gushuokguan would be expected to serve the realm and especially their fellow men. All were working for the betterment of the realm and the everlasting march towards prosperity, and as such all must offer something to the community as a whole, no matter what!\n\nThese principles shall now form the base of Gushuokguan, the bedrock of the Stone Republic upon which we shall build a peaceful and harmonious society.

 gushuokguan_event.18.d:0 "Pubs can and should be places of happiness, camaraderie and pleasure, though sometimes the drinks which are served can turn even the most happy fella into a raging fool. When a group of soldiers visited the renowned Jade Pub abroad, they thought that they would enjoy a night of splendor and drinks, but at the end of the night two soldiers and four local men lay dead on the streets. What caused the incident is still unclear. Some claim that a local man, drunk, wanted an apology from the soldiers for killing his brother in a war some time ago, and as the soldiers refused a fight broke out. Another claims that the soldiers were rowdy and insulting the locals, calling them weak fools who could not fight themselves and had to therefore call in the Stone Army. A third claim is that some soldiers suggested that if the locals couldn’t pay them, that their wives would make a fine payment instead. Whatever started the brawl does not matter; we must sadly conclude that our men have most likely behaved indecently and that reforms are needed, but how is still up for debate. Luckily there is a promising officer named Lubei who could help."

While expansive, the basic principles are inked down on the first page and read as follows:\n\n1. A soldier of the Stone Army is a representative of not only their army but of the Yanshen Union as a whole. They are ambassadors of our cultures.\n2. A soldier of the Stone Army will behave not as if they are at home, but as if they visit their elder. They will show greatest respect for others and refrain from disrespectful behaviour like foul speak, gossip, name calling or arrogance. Behave like you visit your elders!\n3. A soldier of the Stone Army will neither plunder nor steal. Doing so is the gravest of insults to our own principles and peoples. A soldier will buy from locals and pay a fair price. Do not swindle the local populations and do not use your position to haggle locals into unfairly low prices.\n4. A soldier of the Stone Army will always support one’s own brethren in a fight. No one will bend to fear of overwhelming forces. We will stand strong and keep to our oath. We are like stone, we do not break oaths!\n5. All who follow the commands of the Stone Army will, after two campaigns, receive an official bull in which they are granted citizenship and voting rights. These are the highest honours one can receive. Though take heed - if one breaks the commands, one's citizenship can be revoked!"

 gushuokguan_event.31.d:0 "We have for a while now experienced deteriorating relations between our constituent Dao. While most still hold strong to the principle of confederalism, others have called for our ideas to be modernized and propose a more centralized model, one which will still be federal in nature but will grant the council more oversight to prevent internal problems and create a more uniform policy regarding economics and philosophy.\n\nThis proposal has led to a group of Dao and people who support keeping the confederal nature of our union to create a group called the Inked Shields, named after their followers’ practice of dipping shields in black ink to signify their support for the confederal nature of the realm.\n\nIn opposition to this, the supporters of centralization have started to don red scarves, based on the Blue Scarves of yore, the red symbolizing the blood which was spilled to get this far. and the deaths in whose name we must modernize. While both are still cordial as they can be, rifts are starting to appear, especially as both sides are starting to propagandize their views to their people. We are now dancing on a thin cord, and a single puff of wind could throw the entire realm out of balance and into war."

This fight devolved quickly into name-calling and a brawl which was more vicious than any fight we have seen before. We fear that the political unrest that has plagued the union these last years is devolving into something more violent; it seems that a bad forecast approaches us."

 gushuokguan_event.33.d:0 "After the fight in the streets a few months ago, we forbade soldiers of any Dao to wait outside the complex any longer. Despite our best intentions, it seems that this has caused the violence to slowly creep into the complex itself. While the council was convening, two representatives argued not in the manner of gentlemen and representatives, but in a way that only befits brutes. They started to slander each other and hurl slurs. The council chairman attempted to intervene, but only by having guards guide the representatives out of the room would calm return. We and the other representatives are shocked, though more and more seem to agree with the brawlers."

Most of the Dao have vacated their offices in Gushibi and have moved their share of guards for the capital to their own capitals instead. They claim that they no longer feel represented by the council. The Inked Shields claim that the council is trying to modernize and centralize forcefully, giving up the principles of the union while the Red Scarves claim that the council is starting to become a bloated and ancient institution which serves only the blind who remain in the past. It is quiet, though this seems to be merely a calm before the storm.\n\nThe time has come for us to make a decision which side we stand on, one last time."
