 simegasa_events.1.t: "A Price To Be Paid"
 simegasa_events.1.d: "The sun sets over the roofs of Simegasfan. Dejen stands upon the balcony of his palace, exhausted and tired. During his three decades of life in this realm, he has faced multiple assassinations, witnessed dark rituals, acts of terror, and worse…\n\nUnder the influence of a cabal of courtiers and a night spent sleeping under the Dhagismuk tree, he converted at a young age to the ancient faith of his pre-Melakmengi Simegasan ancestors, the Shadowpact - a faith based on propitiating the dark beings of the Shadowrealm. It was purged long ago by Zenidir Zentirizar and his acolytes, enforcing the worship of Amilak and the sky, driving its believers underground. Now, Simegasa has returned to the faith of its ancestors, although the legacy of a millennium of suppression will be hard to erase.\n\nOnly one short year ago Dejen made a deal with the hags of the Yezel Mora, and with their aid he brought Simegasa to its current strength. Yet he is left uncertain what the price for their aid will be.\n\nAs the sun finally slips beneath the horizon, a shadowy ghost creeps up behind him. Dejen notices, but he is not alarmed, for this is not his first encounter with such beings.\n\nIn a steeled voice he questions the ghost, “So you have come for your due payment, what price will I have to pay?”\n\nThe shadow smiles, and responds, “As without me your victory was beyond hope, I only require the lands you’ve conquered with my help. A clever man like yourself will know not to renege on a debt and do what you're told, won't you?”\n\nWith that, the ghost dissipated and Dejen was left alone to ponder his options. In the end he must make a decision, and so he decides to…"

 simegasa_events.2.t: "Wrath of the Righteous"
 simegasa_events.2.d: "Amru, the last scion of the ancient zor Yiwah-Yafet family, has led a quiet existence in his 19 years of life. Though his name is prestigious, and he himself is a prodigious mage of great potential, he never tried to use his pedigree and abilities to acquire real power, instead preferring to be a 'mere' court mage serving as an advisor to the king of Matamot.\n\nAnd then one day, a large delegation of nobles from Simegasa visited the court of Matamot, and brought with them a crown, offering it to Amru. The young man, expected to become the best battlemage of his generation, was persuaded by those around him to take the offer. Since that day, he was no longer just Amru the court Mage, but Amru IV zor Yiwah-Yafet, the final scion of the legendary conqueror of old, and the righteous warrior of Amilak.\n\nAt long last Amru and the seditious nobles of Simegasa have made their move, seizing the city of Mewojala and declaring a holy war against the "servants of evil and shadow that squat in Simegasfan".\n\nWith the secession of Mewojala much of the army and most of the Simegasan nobility went over to their side. Dejen's cry for aid from the Night Coven has been met with silence, forcing the Mezhi to handle this crisis himself. Should Dejen win, then the project of converting Simegasa to the ancestral ways of the shadow will be complete, but should Amru succeed in his righteous fight, then the shadowpact will be purged from these lands and a new kingdom of the devout will re-emerge in western Madriamilak…"

 simegasa_events.2.b: "Gather the shadow priests and the army, we leave for Mewojala by nightfall."

 simegasa_events.3.t: "Revenge of the Righteous"
 simegasa_events.3.d: "Amru stares at his defeated rival as the former Mezhi of Simegasa is nailed to the cross. He seals his enemy's mouth shut, so he cannot scream, before moving on to more important matters. In the coming days, the rivers and roads of Mewojala are lined with crosses, the dead and dying shadow-priests and soldiers of Simegasfan resting upon them, a grim reminder of what awaits all those that side with Yrilak and evil.\n\nThe ill-fated attempt of establishing a realm of shadow within the holy land has failed, another victory of Amilak over Yrilak. Yet for the neighboring kingdoms, all is not well, for a kingdom ruled by a powerful, now experienced battlemage has taken Simegasa's place. The minds of nearby kings are filled with fear and worry, for they wonder if Amru will stop at just Simegasa. Amru has portrayed himself in official proclamations as the second coming of the Firateta, or dread lord, from all those centuries ago, and who's to doubt him?\n\nBut for the common man in Simegasa, none of this matters. Much of the population only reluctantly followed their king in his journey along the path of shadows, and as soon as crosses started appearing along the roads, the people returned to their faith in Amilak, as the sky-priests returned to the temples they had tended to for centuries. With time, none will remember the short period when this land was ruled by cultists, and Dejen will become a mere historical curiosity, a great "what if?""

 simegasa_events.4.t: "The Blackburned Martyr"
 simegasa_events.4.d: "On the central square of Simegasfan, just outside the palace, a large crowd gathers. 113 prisoners have been chained to the ground with a magic circle placed underneath each of them. As their dark design takes hold, the prisoners are transformed, their souls corrupted, now no longer human, but instead reshaped into various monsters of the Shadow Plane. Their minds having been manipulated, now obedient to their master, the Mezhi of Simegasa.\n\nBut Amru is not among them. He instead is forced to watch from a distance, as his former comrades are turned into something he no longer recognizes. As the monsters are led away, the crowd turns their attention to Amru, and a series of spells are cast, along with a ritual prepared by the Night Hags.\n\nAmru is set on fire, a black flame consuming him. But he does not die, as all damage dealt to him is continually regenerated, forcing him to suffer in permanent agony. Over the weeks that follow, his mind slips away, until nothing is left but an empty husk of what was once Amru. The night hags take the husk with them to the shadow plane, pleased with the new magically-gifted servant they have received from Simegasa.\n\nAs the news spreads of what occurred in Simegasfan, the resistance in Mewojala ends, as people retreat to their villages and try to return to their lives. The shadow has triumphed over the sky, as the forces of Yrilak have claimed a realm of their own within the holy land of Amilak."
