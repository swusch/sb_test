#Government Reforms
 xedaxhaz:0 "Xedaxhaz"
 xedaxhaz_desc:0 "Xedaxhaz, the 'many-pack', is the term for a collection of documented policies and systems constructed by the packs of Brrtekuh. They aim to reinforce the balance between the many factions within the government that seek power for themselves, as well as motivate cooperative endeavours between the normally domineering gnolls. Scrap-shotel duels at dawn, salvage-sharing arrangements, marriage and bone-marrow pacts alike - if it help tie Brrtekuh together, it goes in the Xedaxhaz."
 the_mazukxiem:0 "The Mazukxiem"
 the_mazukxiem_desc:0 "An unconventional Republic, the Mazukxiem is a combination of three gnoll packs, all claiming descent from Brrtekuh in some way and all represented by a pack master who has proven themself through a set of trials. The Ekxiemgo, the Council Master who has proven themselves through a combination of trials devised by each of the packs, is expected to lead them all, though they are still beholden to the group and expected to step down when need be. As a precautionary method to keep top state secrets as well as preserve experience, office holders have to be eaten, willingly or not, should they fail to secure their position."

 estate_nobles_U10_torment_of_hellfire_desc:0 "Just as death fuels life, life also fuels death. Kvanga teaches that everything and anything can and must be recycled. The Xhazobkult teaches us a way to do it. Even as we uphold to the Kvangagha, droves of human slaves are sacrificed to demons each day, giving us ample sources of firepower, and destroying any enemy we have in our path."

We must protect them, nurture them, for their resistance is not too far distanced from us, seeking only to live against ever encroaching death. By constructing Toxazg-Akaz all over the Salahad, we can perhaps extend the grasslands of Gol to the Forbidden Plains."

 estate_church_U10_purification_posts_along_the_sorrow_desc:0 "The Sorrow is clearly linked to the Khet, even after death. We need to construct a network of mage towers around it, strategically placed around the nodes of its power as well as in places of heightened paranormal khet activity. This will not only purify the river but allow us to use the excess entropic energy of their curse to power our forts."

 estate_church_U10_potent_exorcists_desc:0 "The Khet leave powerful spirits around when killed, which can afflict those that once harmed them - or worse, devoured them - long after their deaths. Only the strongest may prevent these spirits from afflicting them with a gruesome demise - the strongest, and the best prepared. The exorcists of Brrtekuh wield their faith in Kvanga to draw out, then confront, then devour these spirits, removing their blight from the land for good - and empowering themselves at the same time."
 estate_church_U10_ignorance_campaigns:0 "Ignorance Campaigns"
 estate_church_U10_ignorance_campaigns_desc:0 "It seems that many Khetists are supporting the vengeful spirits of the Khets in secret, not only religiously but through magic rituals as well.

 estate_church_U10_charms_of_protection_desc:0 "Like most spirits, the Khets are still susceptible to certain materials that are normally mundane to most, such as silver, garlic or salt. If we acquire enough of these, we could ensure that everyone can be protected from the effects of these vengeful apparitions."

 U10_the_loyal_pack_title:0 "The Loyal Pack"
 U10_the_loyal_pack_desc:0 " Before Brrtekuh became our leader, we were mere squabbling packs fighting for scraps of good land amidst the desolate dunes. Unlike other leaders before her, she wasn't fueled by mere greed or bloodlust, but by a scheme beyond mortal understanding, her actions part of a seemingly greater plan. Everything was taken into account, even this upsetting catastrophe. The pack only needed to heed the order of her commanders and the rest of the scheme would fall into place."
 U10_second_wind_title:0 "Second Wind"
 U10_second_wind_desc:0 "When the Splitter of Sands managed to rally the gnolls of the Western Krahway, squabbling tribesmen, Irkorzik exiles or Seascourge refugees together, all of us were in awe of her splendor. All of us knew in each of our hearts that her birthright extended from the seas to beyond the sand dunes. Many of our own kind called us crazy, delusional, brainwashed and idiotic for serving what they see as a glorified corpse. But as true believers of Kvanga, we know that death is but the beginning of life. In the last decade, we have spent our time tirelessly finding a way to cure her ailment. Through much trial and error, the Vog Mekza believed that they could, with the proper men and resources, be able to strengthen Brrtekuh's soul with those of others."
 U10_makeshift_navy_title:0 "Makeshift Navy"
 U10_makeshift_navy_desc:0 "Our alliance with the Seascourge pack was one born out of mutual interest: to safeguard gnoll-kind from getting overwhelmed by the humans hunting us, to surround their weak kingdom and then split the spoils -- but most important of all was to share our knowledge. The Viakkoc were more familiar with the vast sea of Divenhal and we Brrtekuh have subdued the desert with the network of bulwarks we have built across it. With our pact finally earning a coastline, we shall voraciously study the design of our enemy's sunken vessels and absorb their essence into our fledgling navy."
 U10_consume_the_king_title:0 "Consume the King"
 U10_consume_the_king_desc:0 "The guards who failed their duty and ambushed Brrtekuh were hailed as a hero among the Deshaki. Thanks to their past successes in their career, they found employment at the court of Eborthíl. The Eborthíli think they and their guards are safe behind their so-called impenetrable fortress, but this arrogance shall not stand! We shall strike our claws into the stone and tear it down brick by brick, until our fangs plunge into the body of the one that wounded Brrtekuh. Then, we shall unleash our full might and paint the royal hall with the blood of the dishonorable cowards who reduced our leader to the sorry state she was forced to endure!"
 U10_splitting_the_sands_title:0 "Splitting the Sands"
 U10_splitting_the_sands_desc:0 "While we were slaving way, scraping by for any sort of sustenance in the desert forsaken by the gods, our fellow gnollkind to the south grew ever more delusional by its false grandeur and they seek to expand it, live with it no matter the death and destruction it causes.\n The golden sands may be beautiful, but it is a lifeless one that seeks to extinguish the cycle of life and death, without ever giving it the chance to rebound. This is an affront to Kvanga herself, we must show our fellow siblings in faith the truth before it is too late."
 U10_thief_of_torrents_title:0 "Thief of Torrents"
 U10_thief_of_torrents_desc:0 "The desert is a cruel place, scorching at sunrise and freezing after sunset, but yet life still fleetingly resists between the shifting dunes. Many have been snuffed out by the desert, wasting their potential. But we faithful shall protect them from the harsh heat and sandstorms, giving them a chance to be so much more, a small step in taming the Salahad."
 U10_butchers_of_chains_title:0 "Butchers of Chains"
 U10_butchers_of_chains_desc:0 "The Kheteratans exploited our grief and chained us to servitude in a twisted mockery of nature, but such a heinous pact could not last. Bound to the land, unwanted by the humans, and left to decay when poor Brrtekuh was hurt and unable to resume her campaign, our enemies wanted us to believe in our own weakness! Brrtekuh trusted us to lead the pack in her stead, and now we have broken free. Now it is time to show the human and arrogant Khet why it was foolish to leave us alive."
 U10_prepare_the_pack_title:0 "Prepare The Pack"
 U10_prepare_the_pack_desc:0 "The humiliation suffered from our last battle was severe; not only did we lose our queen's wisdom, a large part of our pack sacrificed themselves to save Brrtekuh from the human who attempted to slaughter us during our most vulnerable moment. The remains of our lost kin are scattered across the desert, condemned never to reunite with their family through the ritual of consumptive death that we so yearn for.\n\nEven worse are those unfortunate few whose skeletons were snatched by one cowardly human or another, those who who know our practice and seek to defile our dead by decorating their house with the skull of our kin. While their souls may never rejoin the pack, they may roam the earth with the grin on their face when we rid the land of their tormentors and proclaim our primacy. Our great destiny awaits!"
 U10_zerv_zamenx_title:0 "Zerv Zamenx"
 U10_zerv_zamenx_desc:0 "We are not demons, we are creatures of virtue molded by Kvanga. The foolish sun elves would never understand this, to them, we are merely a continuation of centuries of xhazobkultist tyranny. If they truly believe they are worthy enough to name themselves after the sun itself, then let us bring a force of a thousand flames onto their land and see how they fare!"
 U10_beneath_the_sands_title:0 "Beneath the Sands"
 U10_beneath_the_sands_desc:0 "Kheterata, the land of mythical yet very real beings known as Khet. It is said that they possess power only dwarfed by dragons. Surely, by consuming a Khet, we can understand the secrets of their kind? However, we understand it is unwise to confront a Khet, let alone a whole castle of them head on. Instead, we have turned to rumors of long-lost pyramids buried by the dunes of the desert, containing the already mummified bodies of dead Khets.The Khet and Kheteratans will not be pleased with us despoiling the graves of their gods, so we must be discreet. Nothing wrong can happen, right?"
 U10_an_offer_of_freedom_title:0 "An Offer of Freedom"
 U10_an_offer_of_freedom_desc:0 "The Deshaki have taught us that humans are wild, cruel and unruly, not too unlike our ancestral spirits that Kvanga reforged into the first gnolls long ago. As the race crafted and meticulously created by the goddess in her loving image, naturally, we have inherited this mission of hers, acting as benevolent guides to these lost souls, turning them into beings capable of understanding virtue like us. And yet we must remind ourselves to keep a firm hand on them; after all, well-forged tools are first drenched in flames."
 U10_riches_of_deshak_title:0 "Riches of Deshak"
 U10_riches_of_deshak_desc:0 "It was no mistake that Brrtekuh chose Deshak as the first target of her grand conquest. A weak land rich of metals and weak humans worshipping a twisted version of Kvanga, desperately needing true guidance. We have shown them that Eborthil will never fufill this role, only us. But all debts must be paid and they must pay theirs to repent for their sins against our pack."
 U10_collaborative_protection_title:0 "Collaborative Protection"
 U10_collaborative_protection_desc:0 "The delta gnomes of Koroshesh exemplify the virtue of innovativeness preached by the Vog Mekza, their skill in gem cutting second to none. Though currently they are wasting their efforts in serving the decadent Khet, we can reforge them and convince them of our ways. In due time, they could become an integral part of our administration, helping us manage and construct our realm."
 U10_bureau_of_archeology_title:0 "Bureau of Archeology"
 U10_bureau_of_archeology_desc:0 "Our collaboration with the gnomes has opened up a library of knowledge regarding Kheteratan history. Through the establishment of a Bureau of Archeology to uncover lost tombs all over Kheterata, we will be able to more efficiently uncover unguarded burial places, any of which may contain the potent corpses of even more powerful Khets, ready for the eating."
 U10_bulwarks_against_bulwar_title:0 "Bulwarks Against Bulwar"
 U10_bulwarks_against_bulwar_desc:0 "The ashes of the Phoenix Empire are scattered across Bulwar, forever reigniting in its many realms. Demagogues of a dead god, glory-seeking Elves and our corrupted cousins run amok, causing chaos in that cursed land. It may be a wise decision to erect citadels along the border to contain the fires of Bulwar, giving our realm the opportunity to focus on more urgent matters elsewhere."
 U10_commence_the_endgame_title:0 "Commence the Endgame"
 U10_commence_the_endgame_desc:0 "The Kheteratans are truly a lost people: they mock us as blind for our devotion to our disabled pack mistress, and yet they themselves mindlessly and blissfully slave away under the exploitation of the wasteful creatures disguising themselves as gods. But they are unaware of their impending doom. Ever since we killed our first Khet and absorbed its knowledge and power, we have prepared special task forces in key locations of Khet burial, ready at a moment's notice to execute the Khet that reside within our borders. Today, we shall start vanquishing these false pretenders of Kvanga's divinity!"
 U10_finale_of_eternity_title:0 "Finale of Eternity"
 U10_finale_of_eternity_desc:0 "The Khets thought they could escape, but they too are cursed like us, ever bound to the Sorrow. It was only a matter of time before our vigilant armies reached the last of their holdings along the damned river. With the entirety of the Khet under our grasp, we can finally end the life of these wretched and pitiful creatures who have only shown decadence. We will cast their souls into the flames of purification and then our maws to ensure their souls can be repurposed for a greater purpose: strengthen the rule of Brrtekuh and all the greats that shall succeed her."
 U10_auxillary_vultures_title:0 "Auxiliary Vultures"
 U10_auxillary_vultures_desc:0 "The harpies are a resourceful people - how else could they survive in such rugged terrain, in so many remote places? Naturally, through thorough conviction, we can awaken them to Kvangahga, welcoming them as an integral part in our Gnollish armies, combining the gnoll's strength and ferocity with the harpy bird's eye view."
 U10_a_corsairs_cove_title:0 "A Corsair's Cove"
 U10_a_corsairs_cove_desc:0 "Though not a pack based on piracy like Viakkoc, Brrtekuh has been friend to the free-faring corsairs for as long as the Sandspite Pact; many of these corsairs have used our ports as further staging grounds for ventures further east of the Divenhal. At the same time, many extorters north of Deshak are profiteering off our lands, competing with our own honest merchants to amass their own wealth. By collaborating with the corsairs, we could secure trade for ourselves by harassing their ships."
 U10_purification_title:0 "Purification"
 U10_purification_desc:0 "Our nation is plagued by the vengeful souls of ever resentful Khets, the Sorrow bleeding a mother's tears for her ill-bred children. In the midst of these conditions, great shamans from all over our realm have studied the curse as well as the issue of purifying the dead. They have told us of various difficult tasks, requiring us to accumulate resources from across the horizons to dehex the powerful curse that plague our nation."
 U10_the_gnollish_triarchy_title:0 "The Gnollish Triarchy"
 U10_the_gnollish_triarchy_desc:0 "When you devour something, you cannot simply regurgitate it, and have what was consumed be whole again, as if nothing had happened to it. Brrtekuh is dead - but her teachings, her greatness? They have left an impact on us, and we cannot forget it. And so, we must confront it. For Kvanga's will took her away from us, and the Kvangagha dictates what we must do next.\n\n Brrtekuh's spirit must be devoured, as the old Khet were before us - and from this feast, some new shall emerge: a clan of clans, a packs of packs, divided in name but united in descent: the children of Brrtekuh forever more."
 U10_inheritance_of_respect_title:0 "Inheritance of Respect"
 U10_proof_of_the_soul_within_title:0 "Proof of the Soul Within"
 U10_inheritance_of_respect_desc:0 "Brrtekuh never wrote a will or appointed an heir to lead the pack, but when we consumed her remains, we gained her insight, incredible strength and birthright to rule. Brrtekuh showed us that loyalty matters more than any proving in battle. It is time we prove to our fellow packmates that we have truly inherited her soul and recreate the pack to serve out of loyalty and respect, not simply out of fear or dominance."
 U10_proof_of_the_soul_within_desc:0 "Many = those who have strayed from the faith and been tempted by demons - still question our belief that we can draw on the power and memories of those we consume, be they ourselves or others. But it is the truth of Kvanga that everything, even the souls of living beings, can be recycled. In order to correct this issue, the presence of the Vog Mekza must be extended to every corner of the realm to ensure unity."
 U10_from_sands_to_salty_sands_title:0 "From Sands to Salty Sands"
 U10_from_sands_to_salty_sands_desc:0 "After the battle for Deshak, Brretkuh was gravely injured - and that injury spread to her spirit and reputation as well. We have remained steadfast in our devotion to Brrtekuh, but understandably many of our comrades in the Western Krahway haven't. However, with our lands now connecting the warm beaches of the Divenhal to the north and Uelos' Lament to our west, and Brrtekuh's realm once again on the rise, we are reunited as a people, and many have renewed their faith in our Pack-Mistress once again. They are now ready to serve - this time bonded by an unbreakable oath."
 U10_reforge_the_course_title:0 "Reforge The Course"
 U10_reforge_the_course_desc:0 "The Seascourge Gnolls, our long time ally. We have seen them grown, nurtured them from the days they were dying on the scorching paths of the salahad fleeing from Gnollakaz to their invasion of Akasik to now. Of course, we truly care for them as fellow gnolls, it is only natural but they have far too long been following a misguided path guided by their basest wild instincts. Just like Kvanga had done before, we shall intervene and reforge them to see the path of virtue once again."
 U10_prove_our_kinship_title:0 "Prove Our Kinship"
 U10_prove_our_kinship_desc:0 "We Windhowler Gnolls never had our own empire of legend like the other gnolls; we were scattered and divided by the harsh desert, facing perennial waves of conquest from other gnolls and humans. This ends now. With the Ndurubu, so deadset on our extermination, finally defeated and thoroughly subjugated, we have entered a time of Gnollish unity, proving to ourselves that we are not separate tribes, but one united under the destiny of Brrtekuh against Kvangas enemies."
 U10_the_earth_god_and_the_seascourge_title:0 "The Earth God and the Seascourge"
 U10_the_earth_god_and_the_seascourge_desc:0 "Heeding the wisdom of those who braved the path in before-time is a deeply held conviction of our culture - we grow from our ancestors, and inherit their talents and achievements. This has presented a challenge, however, as the integration of the Seascourge into our pack proceeds. They have begun erecting shrines to their demonic ancestors and making pacts with them; when challenged, they argue that they are simply venerating their ancestors as we do. Having been shown Brrtekuh's clemency and refused it, what is to be the fate of these lost kindred, who so persist in their folly?"
 U10_integrate_corsair_codes_title:0 "Integrate Corsair Codes"
 U10_integrate_corsair_codes_desc:0 "Though violent, disorderly and oftentimes brazen, the corsairs of the Divenhal that we sponsor have grown ever more powerful, and as such require strict practices to keep their privateering fleets and crewmates in line. Some of these 'corsair codes', as many have called them, are surprisingly well-structured and republican in nature. If we adopt this wayfaring knowledge and apply it to our own republic, we will surely benefit."
 U10_centralize_the_western_sect_title:0 "Centralize the Western Sect"
 U10_centralize_the_western_sect_desc:0 "Followed by many unorganized tribes isolated in the desert, the Way of the Bone is much more diverse in doctrine than the more unified Way of Iron of the Fieldstalkers. This is the origin of the conflicting beliefs that led to the schism of between Brrtekuh and Irkorzik, dividing two packs that worship the same god. With our grasp over the gnolls of the west secured, we can correct the many mistakes of the past, ensuring that we shall never again be divided against foreign threats."
 U10_return_of_the_queen_title:0 "Return of the Queen"
 U10_return_of_the_queen_desc:0 "Too long have humans looked down on us, dismissing us as nothing more than delusional savages barely worth attention, but our resurgence draws near. Soon all of Cannor, Sarhal and beyond shall hear her name: Brrtekuh!"
 U10_fate_of_the_faithful_title:0 "Fate of the Faithful"
 U10_fate_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "Though the Vog Mekza have served us dutifully, from resurrecting Brrtekuh to dispelling the Khetarch's Curse, they have now stepped out of bounds to seize power for themselves. This is not how we inherit the great legacy of the Splitter of Sands! The pack must stay united under her guidance, even in death. Now, we must decide the traitors' fate."
 U10_adopting_local_structures_title:0 "Adopting Local Structures"
 U10_adopting_local_structures_desc: "Kheterata is one of the oldest human civilizations in history, and though to us they may not possess the most coherent beliefs or culture, they are a treasure trove of not only history but also knowledge in governance. We should extract this and apply it to our own administration, which still remains quite tribal and rudimentary compared to other nations"
 U10_skysea_warfare_desc: "Many harpies have begun joining the ever-growing pirate fleets of the Divenhal, offering indispensable support either as rescuers, wayfinders or raiders from the free skies. As our navy grows, we have to compete with the ever jealous eyes of other great powers. By extending our harpy auxiliaries to our navy and emulating their pirate fleets, we can gain a unique edge combining gnollish ferocity and harpy tenacity."
 U10_skysea_warfare_title: "SkySea Warfare"
 U10_life_begets_death_desc: "The great foundation of Kvanga is the cycle of death and life. Death fuels life and life fuels death. To bring destruction unto your enemies requires grand constructions. And yet great constructions are also the protectors and propagators of life."
 U10_life_begets_death_title: "Life Begets Death"
 U10_pact_of_packs_title:0 "Pact of Packs"
 U10_pact_of_packs_desc:0 "Since its foundation, our pack was one based on strength and admiration, united under a strong paw. However, this has left our pack divided and reliant on fleeting loyalties. Even after securing our legitimacy following the death of Brrtekuh, many of our people are still loyal to certain packs whose wishes do not align with our values, seeking to usurp power for themselves. By codifying laws and institutions that root out false practice, as well as propagating political representation amongst all gnolls, we shall ensure that if an individual ever wishes to threaten the foundation of our nation, they will have to face our unified wrath."

 U10_wipe_the_memory_title:0 "Wipe the Memory"
 U10_crux_of_faith_title:0 "Crux of Faith"
 U10_never_another_sunset_desc:0 "The Vog Mekza seems to be still entrenched in old axioms, fervently convinced that "might makes right" and "the strongest seize the greatest". Yet they are blind to the fact that the strongest is not any one mere gnoll, it is the state itself. Thus, any action to weaken the state is an antithesis to gnolls. All power in the end must be in service of the state and its embodiment of Brrtekuh's legacy."
 U10_wipe_the_memory_desc:0 "Although their gods have been thoroughly stampeded by our hordes for quite some time, many Khetists still fester within our nation, either holding false hopes of a miraculous return, like Elikhet's long ago, or else supporting the mad spirits of the Khets even as they bring destruction to our lands. It is clear that these demons' faith is a thorn in our side, a blemish on our society - it must be eliminated, both physically and in thought."
 U10_crux_of_faith_desc:0 "Long separated, yet inherently the same, redeemed through fire, hardened by water: this is the history of Kvanga and her followers. Under siege on all sides, we have marched through hellfire and cannon smoke to reach our long lost kin of faith in the east. Now from the ashes of war we rise, united in faith once more."
 U10_bone_and_iron_title:0 "Bone and Iron"
 U10_bone_and_iron_desc:0 "The Way of Bone and the Way of Iron: both have strayed from each other due to years of separation, developing differing doctrines, customs and worshipping practices. Yet now it is undisputed that we have reforged this bond, and from today onwards, there will be only one way: the way of Kvangahga."
 U10_3_peoples_1_nation_title:0 "Three Peoples, One Nation"
 U10_3_peoples_1_nation_desc:0 "Ever since we descended upon the sorrowful streams of Kheterata and mounted the heights of Akasik, we have found misguided people under the influence of the false pretence of sloth and brutality. In our wake, we have propagated both death and life: the death of the old harmful practices and faith, as well as the birth of proper humans who are on the cusp of gnollhood."
 U10_seize_sarhals_destiny_title:0 "Seize Sarhal's Destiny"
 U10_seize_sarhals_destiny_desc:0 "Reptiles awaiting for a hypothetical empire to overshadow all others; giantkin wreaking havoc from a desire for pain and suffering; demon worshippers seeking to destroy their souls and that of others alike; greedy humans stealing water and casting thunderstorms that destroys land masses; elves endlessly seeking the grandeur of conquest and zeal; accursed crocodiles ready to rampage at a moment's notice. It is no wonder that Sarhal is known among many as the heart of darkness, yet it is our job to redeem each one of its inhabitants, taking the mantle of a mother for their own good."
 U10_patient_rebuilding_title:0 "Patient Rebuilding"
 U10_patient_rebuilding_desc:0 "Even after buildings have been razed, rivers dyed red, we have found peace and prosperity; for a gnoll does not scoff at a rotting corpse, but consumes it, giving it purpose even in ruin. Similarly, we shall prop up the land we have conquered and breathe new life into it, no matter the cost."
 U10_apex_of_power_title:0 "Apex of Power"
 U10_apex_of_power_desc:0 "We shall dominate all; our power grows ever greater. Soon the hour draws near, the firestorm that shall turn the world molten, its shell serving as a cast. We shall be the great hammer striking down, its force rippling through all Halann, reforging the perfect world that Kvanga has envisioned!"

 flavour_brrtekuh.999.d:0 "For the past several years, Brrtekuh has been wracked by internal chaos and disputes, dealing with everything from political cliques threatening to push the clan into a warlord era to small street gangs destabilizing streets of important economic urban centres to accumulate wealth for themselves. Yet unbeknownst to major parts of the confused populace, three gnolls were assured of their inherited, or rather, consumed birthright.\n\nThe Yzhil, who has consumed the limbs of Brrtekuh, subsequently inherited her great might and aspiring valor. Inspiring those who have succumbed to the lingering instinct of the spirits they were forged from and stamping down on the rest who were too far gone.\n\nThe Zakr consumed her head, with which she presented her ferocious beauty to the world as well as that which howled both inspiring and comforting to the pack in the darkness before sunrise. Almost immediately, they convinced the gnolls who has found no faith to be had left after the death of the great pack mother to enter the fray once more, serving the utmost duty of continuing her name even in vain/\n\nAnd equally important was the Oxh, who consumed the rest of Brrtekuh, who has her heart that beats in grueling battles as well as the mournful aftermath for her kin and is the centre of the body, connecting the entire body and pumping lifeblood throughout her form to ensure all properly function. Even if all have been convinced, we have been proving that unrelenting faith requires a sturdy foundation, with which the Oxh will fulfill.\nWith this, the Mazukxiem was established, a council of her most trusted gnolls led by the Oxh, Yzhil and Zakr continuing her legacy in spirit."

 flavour_brrtekuh.1.d:0 "There are two versions of this story. The first is that three loyal advisors offered their bodies to Brrtekuh; their sacrifice was so powerful and moving that it restored her to health. Restored, she spoke eloquently about what needed to be done, praised the council, and explained that Kvanga had warned her that the Khets were Demons and must be destroyed. Then, she returned to her sleep, satisfied that her pack was in good hands.\n\nThe other version was that the advisors, who may not have volunteered, were drawn to the Headquarters with different intentions. Their corpses were cut into smaller pieces and thrown into a meat grinder until they were a paste. That meat paste was given to Brrtekuh through a funnel. She didn't speak eloquently or have any notion of what was happening; what happened was that one finger started to lift, then another. Soon, her left hand moved, and her eyes no longer stared into the distance but focused on their surroundings. A map was brought, and the council spent hours explaining what had happened and the pack's state. After it had finished, Brrtekuh made two repeated signals with her hand: one for the Khets and the other for the Demons. The Council inferred that this meant that the Khets were Demons and should be punished for their wickedness.\n\nOne of these versions is the truth, and the other is a lie - but does it matter which one the people believe in?"

They did their job with no rage or passion, used to the proper processing of remains for consumption.\n\nThis day would be remembered by all of Eborthíls with deep regret and promises of revenge. The Deshaks had a sense of dread for the rise of another gnoll enemy and compassion for the royal family they had lost. For the gnolls, it was a day of celebration and laughter over how they had avenged a wrong, the destruction of those who dared to hurt their Brrtekuh. But for the executioner…"

This trek was different from the usual fare, however, bringing those same gnolls who have mythologized the endlessly engulfing desert, along with their pack mistress.

But this pack had moved beyond that - for it was no longer the gnollish children of Kvanga they needed - yearned - to prove themselves to.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] rose, and gave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blessing.

Many were too slow, or too attached, to flee. They tried to stay and fight - and they were cut down, and they were slaughtered, and they were devoured. Those who once, even for a short time, called themselves Stewards of the Sorrow were consumed by flame and flashing maw.\n\nThe Vulzinzuirs died with them. The last of their number made a stand at the palace at Elizna. Some may call it retribution for the slaughter of the Irrlazuirs in Medhrubar so many years ago - but the gnolls didn't care about that.

The accused were escorted to the desert and were forced to march, day after day, with no food or water. As they died, their bodies were abandoned, their meat or blood left to waste, the greatest shame possible for a follower of Kvanga, , for their remains were not worth being recycled and used anew. This proceeded till all were gone; it wasn't the end of the punishment. Their names were crossed from the written record, and their families were prohibited from honouring or mentioning them. A Gnoll dies twice, you see: first when they stop breathing and a second time, when somebody says their name for the last time.\n\nStill, a question remains: what to do with the rest of the clergy? They were involved in the rebellion, but some claim that they were manipulated, others that they have seen the error of their ways. The council is faced with a choice: use those left to reform the system or continue the executions."

 flavour_brrtekuh.7.d:0 "As the weathered stone door was pried open, the excavators were greeted with a cold gust, utterly alien to the scorching heat that they had been whooping and chattering to escape just a few minutes ago. Yet even presented with such respite, many hesitated to venture further down the hatch, decorated only with the ashes of torches dotted regularly along the walls. The silence of the pyramid consumed the archeologists for a while, until one brave gnoll volunteered to light the way for the rest.\n\nAs the makeshift expedition ventured deeper into the temple, more and more cat motifs appeared alongside the daubed texts of ancient Kheteratan. Though the language had many odd features and distinctions compared to its modern variant, the archaeologists managed to deduce that this temple indeed treasured the remains of a khet who ventured too far from Kheterata Proper and then, seemingly, killed itself. Other texts surrounded these writings, in an unknown language completely alien to the Kheteratan script. Unable to make head or tail of the text and eager to be done, the party concluded that it was probably nothing too important - likely more biographical detail, as in other similar tombs - and moved on.\n\nEventually, they reached a large room, oddly simple and humble for the tomb of a khet. Yet there it was, a large sarcophagus undeniably housing something bigger than either a gnoll or human. The party cheered in joy for the boon, though they were immediately overshadowed by a loud hiss, causing the party to loudly yelp and scramble out of the pyramid to report their findings."

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had felt the power course through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], the knowledge of absolute mastery, divinity itself. They had left, maw covered in dust-like flesh and torn papyrus, with new power and new purpose: to devour Kheterata in more than name.\n\nLast night, however, [Root.Monarch.GetName] discovered just what that meant. For [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not just take on the boons of their divinity, but the curse of their affliction. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had awoken to a soul-piercing chorus of feline-shrieks and wails, an inescapable cacophony.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stumbled through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace, claws clutching their ears so tightly they tore at the fur and flesh - but the wailing choir was not all [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to be afraid of. Visions of the dead - shambling corpses, unimaginable frights, khet-and-man headed alike - assailed her at the corners of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] world. Terror afflicted [Root.Monarch.GetName] in every way imaginable.\n\nEventually, it had proven too much. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was not the only gnoll assailed in the night - but when the fear-wracked survivors had picked themselves up, they found [Root.Monarch.GetName] cowering in a darkened room. It was only the chatter of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attendants that woke [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not wake to jibbering terror - but a manic certainty, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] grabbed at an attendant.\n\n"It was the KHET-!" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] snarled, maw chattering, trying to hold back a bubbling, broiling laugh. "They CURSED us-" But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] couldn't hold it back for long.

It was cut into the side of one of the eastern mountains - still monumental and awe-inspiring to an untrained eye or a foreigner, or someone who didn't know what it was like to be scorned by the gods of the Sorrow. But still, to get a tomb at all was probably more than what was warranted. When Aakhet sank his draconic maw into Septikhet, becoming one of two individuals in history to kill a Khet, Benukhet saw it all - and in his heart, , he knew what it was to be slain. He felt the terror of mortality.\n\nAnd instead of rising to fight, Benukhet saw that terror, and bowed before it. He became the devourer-dragon's puppet. Through his short, insignificant reign as a child Khetarch, Benukhet kept that terror in his soul. It became an intrinsic, inseparable part of him.\n\nNow, it would be part of Brrtekuh too.\n\nThe pack descended on the tomb, chisel and pick in one claw, torch and scavenged-shotel in the other. They broke the walls, tore undead guard and ancient construct and careful trap asunder, surged into Benukhet's domain like carrion to corpse. It did not take them long to find his sarcophagus - and as the rest of the gnolls stood by, watching, disinterested, unknowing and unwitting, it took the elite among them even less time to devour Benukhet's corpse. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the first among them to taste his flesh.\n\nAnd at once Brrtekuh knew, in their hearts, in their souls, what it was like to kill a god."

Then he doubled over, clutching his stomach. Then he retched that stomach out of his mouth, and died. It carried on in about that manner - gruesome, unexplainable deaths, terrible visions that afflicted those who managed to survive - until most of those who delved into Benukhet's tomb were either driven rabid, or driven dead.\n\nThat was somewhat expected, of course - the greater the Khet, the worse the curse. A Khetarch carried terrible ones, usually. An important Khetarch? Don't expect to survive it.\n\nBut Benukhet wasn't supposed to be important. He played a pivotal role - through kneeling and cowering - but died extraordinarily young, ruled for such a short time. That was why so many had gone along with the raiding party - why, as Brrtekuh's packlords scoured Kheterata for the tombs of Benukhet's contemporaries, those who had lived through Aakhet's reign of terror, so many continued to. Followed the orders in spite of their strange specificity, looted their trifles, while their betters feasted on Khet-flesh. \n\nOf course, only those gnolls knew their underlings' judgement of Benukhet and his kin was direly mistaken. And when Brrtekuh's new elite stood tall above their kin, lying broken in the sand, they cackled and tittered, knowing just how mistaken they were.\n\nThe Curse of the Khet grows..."

Recently, many of his kin had been ambushed on the river - troubled by these invaders. They'd swatted them away, but It'd annoyed him quite a bit. So he came up to punish them. All the rest of the gnolls were dead save one, a curious figure with a moon-shaped scar on her left eye. The Khet noticed that peculiarity - felt an inexplicable pang of fear as he did. But he brushed it aside. She was going to die soon; it was inevitable. The Khet opened his palm and let the sand flow faster and faster until it overwhelmed everything around it, a death by a thousand cuts.\n\nYet the gnoll refused it. For the Khet, this was another affront. How did this overgrown hyena dare to stand? Any other creature would have fallen, had to fall. He redoubled his efforts, drew from divine power.\n\nBut yet again, the gnoll dared to live. Step by step she approached, and so the Khet increased its power, the wind grew to a hurricane-force, the sandstorm so powerful it could crumble iron. The gnoll would yield…\n\nBut it didn't. For the first time in a millennium, the Khet knew rage; the sandstorm grew in size and ferocity, until nothing could survive, no hyena, nor ogre, nor scarab-beast! The gnoll would be swept away for its arrogance! It was inevitable! \n\nAnd then from the sandstorm, a flashing maw emerged in ambush - and soon, the Khet saw neither sand nor sky, but the black of darkness. The gnoll's rending teeth, imbued with ancient-knowing, sank into the Khet's neck. Once, it had been a dragon that had withstood such power, that had flew through sand and storm, that had devoured a god. But not anymore.\n\nThe gnoll's maw clamped shut. The Khet died."

As many of the pack's efficient yet fragile structures were based around the rule of and loyalty to Brrtekuh, these quickly became either defunct or used as political devices to gain clout and legitimacy for aspiring gnolls upon her death.\n\nNow the once united pack, single-minded in one goal, has begun to tear itself apart. Many gnolls have reverted to the violent logic of survival of the fittest, while once prominent military commanders raise banners under their own name as warlords. Yet strangely, these gnolls are still united under one call: that of the dead Brrtekuh, claiming to be her successor in some way, not seeking to create a new pack but seeking to continue the present one."

His pleasure fleet sailed on the waters of the Sorrow - and from the banks, the packs of Brrtekuh descended on them. He'd brushed off the worried reports of his Khet attendants, at first. Then he'd seen one of them ambushed, pounced upon by one of those damned hyenas. He'd stared in disbelief as the gnoll's teeth sunk in to his kin's neck - then shrieked in terror as he yanked back, and took the Khet's head with it.\n\nTerror was a new experience for the Khetarch - and he did not like it. Every night afflicted with terror, every day spent sweat-drenched, shivering in spite of the heat. He had to fight - there was no other choice.\n\nAnd so he'd come out to do just that. It was an apocalyptic scene - immense storms of sand and locust carried away invader and defender alike, as the river retreated and burst forth, tide-like against the gnollish flood. Screams, shrieks, cackling laughs and despairing yowls. The full power of his divine race assembled - but half-hearted, and stricken with a terror unknown and alien. The Khetarch could see he was losing. And so he rose from his throne, and stepped out onto the deck, and raised his arms, and tried the last thing he thought might make a difference.\n\nThe Sorrow rose. The Khetarch's barge remained steady, sure - but the others tipped, rumbled by the rising and roiling water, as human and khet-corpse and gnoll alike tumbled over, sucked into the slow-rising maelstrom that was once a river. The Khetarch allowed himself to smile, despite the nerves, the dread-fear. He was a god. Clearly, he was worrying over nothing.\n\nBut then he noticed a sound from behind him. A soft foot-fall against a rug. The Khetarch turned.\n\nHis life lasted only another second. The Last Khetarch did not scream, shriek, yowl, purr in disappointment. He simply glimpsed the maw of [Root.Monarch.GetName] as it closed in around his head - and for an instant, registered that this was the end."

The Khetarch had not simply expired by natural causes, but had been consumed by invading gnolls. The faithful are in anguish at the loss of their gods, though most of us realize that we must move on. The question is, where can we possibly go from here? Do we turn to the Aakhetists and their Bronze Dragon? Or is it possible that these gnolls follow a superior vision under their goddess?"

 flavour_brrtekuh.19.d:0 "Thirty days later, the Khetarch appeared again. Not as flesh and blood, but as the Sorrow itself. A wailing, shrieking, yowling form of shifting water, drawn up from the river into the form of a devoured thing. It strode, clawed itself through the river, and caused mayhem wherever it went.\n\nOnce, the Khet were decadent. Once, the Khet were lazy. Once, the displays of their power were frivolous, meaningless - an annihilating aside. The people of the Sorrow thought that they had grown accustomed to something different - a new sort of malevolence. A sign that the Khet cared about anything more than pleasure.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s maw clamped shut around the Khetarch's head, as blood squirted and bones snapped, as the body of a god fell limp and severed, the Sorrow crashed to the riverbed. It would have killed [Root.Monarch.GetName] too, if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not now half-what-[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]-ate [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself].\n\nMaybe the Khetarch had been killed while his spirit was entangled in the essence of the sorrow. Maybe this was an echo of the power he held in life. Maybe this was Elikhet himself, come down to punish those that slew his successor. Maybe the river just sort of did that. It didn't matter. When the Khetarch rose-as-the-river, spectre-like, and he raised his arms, and red torrents washed away fleeing-caravan and gnoll-pack alike, and scarab-swarm savaged the plains, and the ghosts of the devoured ran roughshod through the cities, all Kheterata knew again the power of their dead gods."

 flavour_brrtekuh.21.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stares at the horizon of their grand conquest, perhaps finally finding rest knowing all of the Khets have finally died. Yet to their dismay, the Sorrow begins to bubble, and froth - first with the white of foam, then a dark red, blood-like. The amphibians scurry out of the water at its approach - the fish flee for the shores, desperately trying to flop their way out - away! - onto land. Soon enough, the entire river is consumed by the roiling, thick substance, congealing amidst the reeds, sucking the life out of the river-banks. The fish who dare not to seek a more comfortable death soon rise up to the surface of the river. Not long after, swarms of insects, most prominently flies and oddly mosquitoes, gather to cover the lake, not only consuming the carrion and blood-like substance but also harassing those on the banks. Khetists who have seen this feel reinvigorated, convinced of their dead god's message, holding tight to their convictions against our greatest attempts of conversion."

In the past we find guidance and wisdom to carry us into the future. Of course, the past was not always perfect, and few gnolls exemplify this better than the Seascourge Gnolls. On the one hand, they are part of our realm, and our peoples have long entwined histories. They have helped our campaigns, and we have saved one another in times of dire need. And yet, their ancestors were also demon worshippers. Should we allow them to revere gnolls who were misguided at best, or outright corrupt at worst? Or should we fashion new myths for them to follow, even at the risk of taking their history away from them?"

According to the rumours, a small working group of Council members had met to solve some insignificant problem, just a discussion about water rights on a small tributary of the Sorrow. But the others saw it instead for something darker-something seditious, against the pack, against Brrtekuh. They murdered the "dissident" council gnolls and displayed their corpses around the capital.\n\nThere is also no record of who authorised the murders or the brutal display, but what was known to all was that the Council would not tolerate any dissent, no matter how minor it was. Instead of being scared, it backfired immediately, the population horrified at what lengths the Council had gone to; Brrtekuh herself would never have done this. So it began the Age of Doubt in Brrtekuh."

First, you made Wind Barriers; no more violence was allowed in Council Fights. Then you planted the first crops; all Council meetings were open to the public, and the records were made available. Then you fed those crops and kept growing bigger and more resistant trees; open assemblies were organised where the people could partake and talk about their local problems and questions to the local Council members.\n\nIt was a slow and painstaking project, but if it were possible to conquer the desert, it would likely regain the people's trust."

The solution? The entire Council was locked inside a building, with guards watching every entrance, and only the basic food and water allowed inside. The councillors could only leave when they all agreed and solved their problems.\n\nAt the start, screams and violence could be heard from the building. As time passed, monotony and apathy settled in. Seeing no other way out, the Council started to talk among themselves, solving the feuds, smoothing the ideologies, and connecting. What came out of the building wasn't anyone's preferred scenario, but it was the one they could all agree on."

At the heart of our territory, the former Kheteratans resourcefully scavenge for resources, resculpting the land and buildings to facilitate fertile fields to feed the peoples across the land.

Yet here we are, standing at the zenith of gnollkind. Such a grand campaign could not simply be attributed to mere chance: it is simply divine in nature, a work of Kvanga achieved by her emissary Brrtekuh. Many Cannorians and Sun Cultists have told prophecies of gods who bestow their essence upon Halann; none have greater evidence for their claim than the blessing which we have received for ourselves. As we have consumed Brrtekuh, we have also consumed the essence of Kvanga, and bear her holy soul. We are the reforger of squander, the tamer of the wild and the protector of the cycle."

Finally, after the flames have charred the land, from the ashes of death and destruction, after the flies have consumed until the world is rotless, FINALLY, a new world shall be ushered anew, a land up to us to forge, to guide.

The ropes could all be tied together and create an even stronger rope, the broken swords could be melted for new weapons, the rotten food used as fertiliser for the gardens.
