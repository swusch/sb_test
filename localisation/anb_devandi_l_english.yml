 devandi.1.t: "Unifying Soul of Nahrei"
 devandi.1.d: "The last ceremony of the weeks-long festival of the Unifying Soul of Nahrei has come just in time, for the [Root.GetAdjective] have begun to grow restless. They have spent the past month in deep meditation and introspection on the nature of the world and their place in it. The ceremony begins and ends with the Flyransh, or “Flower Dance,” in which the [Root.GetAdjective] dance around a flower-wreathed pole, as each dancer individually approaches the central pole to pray to the souls. But the true boon of the festival is not seen until the last Flyransh ends. Afterwards, there is a feeling of energy in the air, as each [Root.GetAdjective] is eager to apply their learnings to the world."
 devandi.1.a: "Sometimes all it takes is a little gratitude."
 devandi.2.t: "Solid Fortitude"
 devandi.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] can feel it: war has come to [Root.GetName]. In the past, all-out conflict was rare among the Devandi, but times are changing. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken to rousing the army of [Root.GetName] with a terrific speech, reminding them of the great gift of freedom given to them by the liberator Munakles and their duty to preserve it in the face of the oppressors. Afterwards, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can notice a small but substantial difference in the behavior of the columns: the soldiers stand straighter. Conversation has ceased, and every soldier has a determined gleam in their eye."
 devandi.2.a: "Our cause is righteous!"
 devandi.3.t: "An Offering"
 devandi.3.d: "A priest of [Root.GetName] approaches the wood-hewn altar with an offering to the souls. The Devandi do not sacrifice their wealth or raw resources, for they know that the souls are too wise to accept that. Instead, they sacrifice their sentimental items and keepsakes, however valuable they may be; That which the priest has placed on the sacred altar.\n\nOver the course of a few hours, the items on the altar evaporate and disintegrate into dust as the surrounding [Root.GetAdjective]s offer hushed last-minute prayers to the souls. The blessing of the souls is subtle: the next few harvests are a little healthier. Laborers work a little harder. The nation of [Root.GetName] is a little more energized."
 devandi.3.a: "Thank the Souls!"
 devandi.4.t: "Seismic Sense"
 devandi.4.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watches as the geomancers of [Root.GetName], known as Femezkhanz, scour the lands for gems and precious stones. The progress of the Femezkhanz is quick and silent, for they never need to stop to dig or examine the ground. Suddenly, the group ceases their quick gait, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiles as they dispatch a messenger. The Femezkhanz, with their magical sense, have almost certainly discovered a significant cache of valuable ore below their location. Within the day, a group of zealous [Root.GetAdjective] miners will be sent to settle the area. As the message-bearer draws closer, [Root.Monarch.GetName] ponders one last question: what mineral could it be?"
 devandi.4.a: "Hopefully something valuable."
 devandi.5.t: "Grand Pilgrimage"
 devandi.5.d: "The Mazhthramazh faith is more than a millennium old, but its teachings are timeless. The wise words of Munakles and the animalistic beliefs of the Devandi are transmitted orally and, as such, have become scattered throughout the Valley. Thus, the goal of each pilgrim is to travel around the holy Valley visiting each region to learn its unique stories and aphorisms, as well as visiting the informal holy sites of Mazhthramazh. This is the journey that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has embarked on, and over the next few weeks, with a caravan of Femezkhanz, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will visit all, from the most rural Mteibhar village to the most travelled monuments of Mzhaara. "
 devandi.5.a: "Bless the Valley!"
 devandi.6.t: "Raid!"
 devandi.6.d: "The land of [askaeorg_raid_target.GetName] is aflame, for the Chendhyans have come through. The farmlands burn, and the minor settlements stand silent and vacant, having been looted by the raiders. There was very little resistance, for the cat-riders are far too wily and quick to be caught, and the inhabitants of [askaeorg_raid_target.GetName] too scared to engage. The ancient strategy of the Chendhyans, known as the Qahliræ, involves three steps: first, ravage the undefended countryside; then, loot the smaller settlements; then, if the enemy is distracted, attempt to pierce into the cities to cause further chaos and take more."
 devandi.6.a: "Such is Life!"
 
 #Religious Abilities
 unifying_soul_of_nahrei: "Unifying Soul of Nahrei"
 desc_unifying_soul_of_nahrei: "The festival of the Unifying Soul of Nahrei, despite what its name may suggest, is not a brief celebration but rather a weeks-long period of intense introspection for the Devandi. The Unifying Soul of Nahrei is interspersed with festivals, each dedicated to learning about and discussing a certain aspect of Nahrei, the creator soul. The celebration bears its name from the ending festival, known as the Unifying Soul. By calling our nation to this celebration, we may give them a greater appreciation for this world and its possibilities."
 solid_fortitude: "Solid Fortitude"
 desc_solid_fortitude: "The central tenet in the teachings of Munakles is freedom and the necessity of its preservation. It must be protected at all costs, even if that means attacking first. By reminding our warriors of the enormous importance of their fight, they will certainly be more ferocious."
 a_sense_of_freedom: "A Sense of Freedom"
 desc_a_sense_of_freedom: "The Devandi believe that times of peace and freedom are only temporary and that eventually they will once more face hardship. Thus, during prosperous periods, Devandi rulers will often hold nationwide celebrations of the sense of freedom that their people enjoy."
 an_offering: "An Offering"
 desc_an_offering: "Followers of the tradition of Munakles believe that they must seek a closer tie to the souls of Halann, who typically represent an aspect of the world. The Devandi typically offer personal possessions to the souls in exchange for guidance on achieving freedom of the mind, body, and spirit. However, Devandi rulers in the past have not shied away from requesting material blessings from the souls, of course, when they are willing to pay the price."
 bonds_of_the_world: "Bonds of the World"
 desc_bonds_of_the_world: "We were all created by the souls, and we were all brought to safety and freedom by Munakles, who taught us to remember our common heritage and our common goals. By emphasizing unity, Devandi rulers in the past have loosened tensions along with purse strings."
 seismic_sense: "Seismic Sense"
 desc_seismic_sense: "The Femezkhanz are the mage class of the Mteibhar, who are magically attuned to the ground of Halann. They are capable of easily manipulating the earth, but they are especially useful to the Mteibhar because of their ability to sense ores and precious metals. Influential rulers often leverage the Femezkhanz to find prime spots for settlement and excavation."
 plains_of_learning: "Plains of Learning"
 desc_plains_of_learning: "The teachings of Munakles emphasize betterment and adaptation over tradition. As such, Mazhthramazh rulers often send delegations to neighboring nations to examine and learn from them."
 grand_pilgrimage: "Grand Pilgrimage"
 desc_grand_pilgrimage: "The sacred valley is large, and the teachings of Mazhthramazh are not centralized. Individual regions carry their own unique stories, teachings, and interpretations of the Mazhthramazh worldview. By visiting or traveling around the Mteibas, a ruler may learn much."
 dance_of_the_flying_serpents: "Dance of the Flying Serpents"
 desc_dance_of_the_flying_serpents: "It is said that when the Chendhyans encroached into Taychend, at Armahadastir, they adopted the native Dance of the Flying Serpents to make peace with the Taychendi. Eventually, the dance became a way to instill peace and balance in times of strife."
 hunt_of_togetherness: "Hunt of Togetherness"
 desc_hunt_of_togetherness: "Hunts are the common language of the Chendhyans; they are integral to daily life and an easy way to bond or resolve differences. Powerful Chendhyan rulers in the past have used tribal hunts to rally their warriors and soldiers before a war or battle."
 askaeorg_raid: "Raid!"
 desc_askaeorg_raid: "There is no better exclamation of Chendhyan faith than the raid. All Chendhyans understand the passion and righteousness behind the act of attacking one’s neighbors and seizing their valuables. It is utterly just, for the Askaeorg faith demands that its followers proactively preserve their freedom."

 chendhyan_tribal_federation: "Chendhyan Tribal Federation"
 chendhyan_tribal_federation_desc: "The plains of the Chendhya have been our home for millennia, and it is on these vast plains that our creed has been born: to raid and fight for our own sake, to cast down the chains that bind us and to run free across the lands. While we cherish our sacred freedom, it cannot be absolute for us to function as a society. Therefore we need a system in place to organize raids and resolve disputes over raiding trophies, pasture usage and more to prevent the dissolution of our tribe into anarchy. Thus, a council of elders, recruited from among the clans, is formed to discuss and dispute, and to elect a great ruler, the Adezheg, with the authority to decide for the tribe, as long as they have the support of the elders."

However, for this to succeed it will require great changes to both Taychendi society and our own. More formalized rules of settlement, clear rules of pillage in times of war and of tribute in times of peace, and a clear vision for the future to leverage our amassed wealth to become what has only been achieved once during the greatest moment of our history: a true Ezhudar."

 desc_declare_zhutashsar: "The path to becoming a Zhutashsar, a Mteibhar philosopher, has always been a nebulous one. Some were recognized posthumously, others gradually came into eminence in their lifetimes. But to declare oneself a Zhutashsar is an action guaranteed to ignite intense controversy and opposition. To do so as a ruler will certainly destabilize the realm. Philosopher-rulers have always been polarizing figures, and only the wisest have managed to turn it to their benefit."

 mteibhar_monastery_tsharab_desc: "---------------\nIt was not chance that Mt. Tsharab was where the hero Munakles first entered the Mteibas. The presence of the mountain can be felt by those in the vicinity; its immense spirituality has earned it the nickname “The Heart of the Devand.” But more often it is the Devandi who have made their mark on the soul of the mountain, not the other way around.\n\nIt was in the time of Munakles that Mt. Tsharab was first developed, built as a beacon and gathering point for his diverse peoples. It was at the end of this bygone age that monks first declared the mountain holy, slowly expanding their monastic complex over the centuries, although the site found more frequent use as a Chendhyan war camp for the likes of Ultarlan. By the 11th century the complex had fallen into the hands of the Femezkhanz, becoming the summer capital for the enigmatic mage-priests of the Mteibhar. But the day of the Femezkhanz has drawn to a close, and their constructs, abandoned decades ago, have fallen into disrepair.\n\nCountless philosophers and great men have visited Mt. Tsharab, and countless more will come."

 devandi.7.t: "Reflections on Mt. Tsharab"
 devandi.7.d: "“I heed the words of the conqueror Vaunsarlanbeg:\n\n‘To step on the stones of Tsharabmazh is to see oneself in the context of a thousand years. But I am not overwhelmed by past or future. I learn to love the present, for I see my place in the timeless continuity of history.’ \n\nTo find one’s way to the top of the mountain is a monumental task in itself, and one that rewards the curious. One wrong turn, and I am transported down the mountain to an old burial ground from the post-Munaklean days. I gaze at the graves: all of them carry unfamiliar names, but they must have been eminent, as indicated by their lofty engravings. \n\nThe name of one stands out: SHOLANSHAZA YSTAERANAS ALA’ZHAMATHAN. Who was this person? To be Sholanshaz, the leader of the legendary order of Mteibhar Femezkhanz mage-priests, was a significant achievement; how important they must have been in their time! How ambitious they must have been, as was the nature of all Femezkhanz. Yet for all my delving into Mteibhar history, I have no memory of this supposedly significant figure. \n\nA sense of futility comes over me. Despite their exploits, they were forgotten. To be remembered is the secret desire that all great statesmen find in common with each other, after all. How many great things have I done! Yet it seems inevitable now that in a matter of centuries I will lie unremembered, as was the case with this Sholanshaz. \n\nI sit in silence for a while, churning over one overwhelming question: What must I do?” \n\n- Journals of $MONARCH$, $YEAR$"

 devandi.8.desc: "For weeks $MONARCH$ had been in secret discussion with their closest advisors. To declare oneself a Zhutashsar, a title awarded posthumously to the most prestigious thinkers, was practically unheard of. The risks were enormous: $MONARCH$ would certainly face much scrutiny and skepticism from the factions within his nation, where it would be seen as almost heretical. But the reward was equally as potent, should their declaration find solid ground: wide-spread acceptance of whatever theory they proposed, and the associated prestige and authority which came with the title of Zhutashsar. \n\nWith their advisors uncertain, the decision lay at the will of $MONARCH$."
