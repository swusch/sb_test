 zaradyrra.2.d:0 "The hours pass and the performance ends. A decision confronts our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: we must put the best of our talents to use to further our redemption through art. It is time for us to tell a new story. The question is very simple: which story will we tell this time?"

 zaradyrra.10.title:0 "Performance: Embroidery"
 zaradyrra.10.desc:0 "Foreigners might look at an Ashhana’s embroidery and scoff. How does this do anything more than calm one person’s soul, they say? Well, those in these lands that perform embroidery have been shrugging off such questions for a long time. Working almost in a blur of limbs, string, and needles, the artisans compose any design the audience or scholars can think of. Is a tree desired? It will be made. What of something more solemn? It too can be embroidered. Unless it fails to calm the soul or worsens the Blood Curse, no demand is too great, nor is any prompt infeasible.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.10.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"

 zaradyrra.11.title:0 "Performance: Weapon Demonstration"
 zaradyrra.11.desc:0 "The Ashhana know well that at times war is a necessity. They do not dare sit in complacency or accept a lack of preparation. The crafting of weapons through metalwork is thus one of the sacred Hundred Petals. Confident in the virtue of their task, blacksmiths prepare their weapons with humble devotion. They are paired with warriors known for their restraint and patience, who then test the forged weapons for all to witness. The audience watches and learns. When such a display comes to the village, one or two youths are inevitably inspired to work as blacksmiths themselves.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.12.title:0 "Performance: Rhythmic Blade Dance"
 zaradyrra.12.desc:0 "Our finest warriors stand to arms as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] watches with rapt attention, refusing to be distracted by the muttering of distant scholars, always in dispute as to whether the Blood Curse is actually being helped at all by performances such as these. Drawing their blades, the warriors dance in ever-more complex formations, sometimes treading carefully as if on quicksand, sometimes rampaging in memory and condemnation of the worst excesses of the Blood Curse. Calming their souls and fortifying the resolve of those they defend, the soldiers - nay, artists - turn their blades into extensions of themselves. \n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.13.title:0 "Performance: Sand Mandala"
 zaradyrra.13.desc:0 "The tradition of the Colors of Life finds a great and truly noble manifestation when it is brought to life in a manner truly befitting the Great Cycle. On a patch of sand, what a foreigner might call “mandala” takes shape. Flower petals and natural paints, the gifts of Zakytzkaras, lend color to what might otherwise be a simple feat of geometry. Thus the Great Cycle blooms in the minds of those that watch. \n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.14.title:0 "Performance: Tool Decoration Ceremony"
 zaradyrra.14.desc:0 "The complaint is simple: the tools look drab and uninspired. Once they had surely been elegant in their simplicity, but the fact is that as they are they are no fit manifestation of the Zakytzkaras.\n\nAn artist, guided by the joint efforts of scholars of the Humble Zeal and the Colors of Life, assumes responsibility for fixing this problem. With a mix of solemnity and great joy, artist and audience join in a cacophony of voices, figuring out together what the colors of the tools shall be, and what ornamentation shall adorn them.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.14.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"
 
 zaradyrra.15.title:0 "Performance: Creating Tools, Then Using Them"
 zaradyrra.15.desc:0 "One by one the petitioners – civilians, merchants, soldiers, nobles – are brought forward to speak to the artisans and their scholarly advisors. Some of their needs are met by that which has already been made; some the scholars of the Humble Zeal and the Great Cycle see a need to devise a tool anew. But to the wonderment of the audience, no problem proves too great or too petty to have a tool made. As each tool is refined and put to use by their new owners, inspiration spreads. \n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.16.title:0 "Performance: Music from Natural Instruments"
 zaradyrra.16.desc:0 "Which Ashhana dares forget what saved us from the demonic hags and their vile blood curse, breaking us from our cycle of darkness? It was the music of nature - the soul song brought about by natural music backing the desperate voice of a lone war-bard. Today we bring that venerable tradition to life: today we show forth that even the stones will cry out the glory of the Zakytzkaras. And amidst their song and the Great Cycle, we will build the 333rd Empire in this, our beloved land.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.17.title:0 "Performance: Synchronized Smithing"
 zaradyrra.17.desc:0 "So often the creation of art requires the humility to admit that one cannot go it alone, that one needs others around to produce something truly worthy. There is no greater manifestation of this humility than in the tradition of synchronised smithing. The smiths in a given province begin their work all at once, and time their strikes and labour with one another, creating a hymn out of what the unenlightened would merely call cacophony. They begin together and complete their art together, creating metalwork without pareil in its beauty and sacredness.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.17.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"

 zaradyrra_performance_mistake:0 "The mindful, considered twists and turns of the ritual performance, instantaneously accounting for unexpected problems and fixing them in real time, show forth the preparation and competence of the artist. The audience is inspired to go out and make beauty out of their own errors."
 zaradyrra_performance_onslaught:0 "An onslaught of problems beleaguers the performance. Perhaps the artists came somewhat unprepared; perhaps some fool gave in to the Beast Soul and sabotaged the artists’ work. But the audience’s help and forgiveness salvage the performance, inspiring those who were watching to further the virtues of forgiveness and self-reform."
 zaradyrra_performance_bard:0 "As in the tale of the Bard, watching the artwork take its shape fills the attending populace with hope. Uplifted to a higher plane of consciousness through the completion of the art, the attendees think on how to spread the hope they have received to their surroundings."
 zaradyrra_performance_rising:0 "As if physically marching uphill towards the attainment of the 333rd Empire through beauty and striving, the ritual artwork inspires and incites its viewers. As the performance draws to its end, younger citizens are heard muttering, “There must be more than this!” They think about how to convert their dreams and ambitions into action."
