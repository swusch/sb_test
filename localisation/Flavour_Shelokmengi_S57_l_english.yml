 S57_fields_of_fortune_title: "Fields Of Fortune"
 S57_fields_of_fortune_desc: "Our kingdom has always enjoyed a blessed existence, nestled in the bosom of the Yet river valley. We are named the valley kingdom for a reason, as it is the valley which has always provided for us. One particular resource has always been in ample supply in our lands - Grain. Glorious, glorious, grain.\n\nA steady reliable source of food is the key for any thriving civilization, and this is something that we have plenty of. All that is required of us is to properly invest in the infrastructure of our farms and our people will flourish like the verdant fields surrounding their villages."

 S57_shepherd_of_rain_title: "Shepherd Of Rain"
 S57_shepherd_of_rain_desc: "Now that the treacherous nobles' power has been curbed, it is time to have a closer look at our relationship with the Semayebaka. They represent Amilak’s will, and pray to him for rain to water our fields and clear skies to calm our people and allow them to work. Some of these priests have been blessed with the ability to control the weather in a limited fashion. If we manage to get on their good side by supporting their endeavours, we will surely bolster our farming economy."

 S57_i_bless_the_rains_title: "I Bless The Rains..."
 S57_i_bless_the_rains_desc: "The priests and mages of Shelokmengi have been working tirelessly, thinking of further ways to use Amilak’s blessings for the good of our realm. A meeting was recently held between the Mezhi, the Semayebaka and the mages, discussing what could be the next step.\n\nOne suggestion received wide support - using Amilak’s powers against any invaders, regardless of who they were. It may be considered sacrilegious to use weather magic offensively against other Mengi, but self defense is another matter entirely!\n\nTo bring this new plan to fruition we need to assemble a dedicated cadre of our most skilled mage-priests and provide them with a grand temple to perform their miracles in, situated close to the skies in the highlands of Keychashow."

 S57_friends_in_holy_places_title: "Friends In Holy Places"
 S57_friends_in_holy_places_desc: "The nobility, called ‘lesser kings’ or ‘Yenaze Mezhi’, are not to be trusted. They betrayed the last king, making their own illegitimate kingdom of “Enikmesiki”. The nobles that remain are constantly squabbling amongst each other in their desperate scramble for power, while undermining our own authority.\n\nHowever, there is one influential group we can trust. The holy Semayebaka. We will work together with the clergy, elevating them to a higher position of power, and in this way take power away from the petty Yenaze Mezhi."

 S57_seize_the_semadami_title: "Seize The Semadami"
 S57_seize_the_semadami_desc: "Our plan has worked! After seeking the advice of the wise Semayebaka, we have implemented a new technique to improve the working conditions and as a consequence the size of the harvest of our peasantry. Already we are looking towards further strengthening the mage-priests power, while boosting our economy at the same time.\n\nOne of our advisors pointed out to us the rich magical potential of the ‘Semadami’, or Damestear in common tongue, found within the Senidmot crater. We should legitimize our control over this sacred site by constructing a new holy temple to Amilak there."

 S57_amping_up_production_title: "Amping Up Production"
 S57_amping_up_production_desc: "“This is ridiculous! Putting what is essentially a mill on top of a temple? On top of ALL temples we make? Absolutely ridiculous! If this was not coming from Mezhi Ayufar himself, I would immediately deny this request. Does he not know how difficult this would be to construct? And for what, to make grain at the same place you worship Amilak? This is absolute hogwash!”\n- Anonymous note found on construction blueprints of a successfully completed grain temple"

 S57_down_in_madriamilak_title: "Down In Madriamilak!"
 S57_down_in_madriamilak_desc: "There are many steps required for putting bread on your plate.\n\nFirst, the grain must be planted in one of the many fields of Madriamilak. There it is tended to and taken care of by the farmers, working long and hard, yet fulfilling days.\n\nThe mage-priests then command the rains to water the fields on even numbered days and then in turn force the clouds to give plenty of sun on odd numbered days. Then comes the harvest season, where every man and his slaves will harvest the numerous fields, and bring the yield to the grain-temples.\n\nAfter earlier designs turned out to be… rather volatile, windmills tend to be situated next to the temples these days, so that rain could be quickly called down by the rain priests in case of a grain dust fire. In the mills the precious grain is turned into the flour you use. Add in some yeast, bake the mixture and then voila! Bread."

 S57_long_live_the_king_title: "Long Live The King!"
 S57_long_live_the_king_desc: "Ayufar the Second has finally been crowned king, and ascends as Mezhi of Shelokmengi, the Valley Kingdom. After eight long years of constant struggle between Queen Almaz and the nobles of the Regency Council, their time at the reins of power has passed and now there is only one king who will rule them all.\n\nYet for some bizarre reason, the nobles that formed the regency council are not happy with this new state of affairs. They spread vicious rumours to undermine their new king, accusing Ayufar of planning to strip the nobles of all their power and enforcing needless laws and restrictions to suffocate the proud Shelokmengi spirit with superfluous bureaucracy, thus inevitably leading this country to ruin. We shall prove to those naysayers that only those with nefarious intentions have anything to fear from our reforms."

 S57_invitations_to_all_title: "Invitations To All!"
 S57_invitations_to_all_desc: "“To the esteemed receiver, \nYou are invited to the Royal Court of His Majesty, Mezhi Ayufar II zor Fantu-Amru, due to your talents catching his eye. Bring your finest attire, the tools of your craft, and your extensive talents. His Majesty will listen to every courtier in hopes of improving the state for the betterment of Him and His people.\nSigned,\nYemane the Secretary”\n-A letter dating back to shortly after the conquest of Enikmesiki."

 S57_the_seed_of_knowledge_title: "The Seed Of Knowledge"
 S57_the_seed_of_knowledge_desc: "“I have seen them; the ships, I mean. Moving up and down the river, day in and day out. It seems the Mezhi is increasing the scope of his invitations. I have seen some of these ‘experts’, men and women from far off lands, such as the river-cities of Bulwar, or the palaces of Rahen.\n\nApparently that philosopher Ayufar is fond of is the one shepherding them around, making sure we don’t send them back packing to where they belong.”\n- A minor noble in Berfan, overheard complaining about Ayufar’s continued court policies."

 S57_up_the_river_title: "Up The River"
 S57_up_the_river_desc: "“We’ve been here for a few days now, digging out silt from the river to deepen it, while driving wood pylons into the bank to make a port. All to support ships sailing up the Yet. Once we’re done, we’ll be heading to the next town over, ironic that we must walk so others may sail. At least the beer here’s cheap.”\n- Overheard chatter from a worker in Werksar."

 S57_the_great_harvest_title: "The Great Harvest"
 S57_the_great_harvest_desc: "“Let it be known that, at the generous behest of Mezhi Ayufar II, all lords of Shelokmengi are invited permanently to his residence at the palace. All your food, activities, and accommodations will be taken care of.\n\nIn return, your estates will be managed by your stewards, and if you lack any, the Mezhi will send out his own to tend to your lands. In this new era of Shelokmengi, the nobility need not fret over the tedious tasks of state. That is what you have servants for, after all.”"

 S57_enemies_or_merchants_title: "Enemies Or Merchants"
 S57_enemies_or_merchants_desc: "“Most of my people are demanding I issue the expulsion order, demanding all those of Raheni descent leave our shores for their ancestral homeland at once, preferably with only the clothes on their backs and northern winds to guide them on. It is regrettable, but the finances it would bring would allow more of my reforms.”\n\n“I know,” His philosopher replied, “But though seizing their wealth may bring us a short term gain, perhaps it would be more wise to keep them here, and use them as middlemen between us and their wealthy cousins back in Rahen?”"

 S57_lord_of_rain_title: "Lord Of Rain"
 S57_lord_of_rain_desc: "“You know, I thought the Mezhi was a fool when he sought aid from the Naléni, but now I see the merit in it. I did not think we would be able to carry those heavy stone blocks so far into the mountains, even with the new steps and passageways carved across them.\n\nOur final construction is up there, at its highest peak, a grand temple. It shall reflect Amilak’s glory, and bring his rain across the valley and much of Madriamilak… if it does not break all our backs first.”\n- Discussion overheard at a bar, just below Emot Nepas."

 S57_my_empire_of_grain_title: "My Empire Of Grain"
 S57_my_empire_of_grain_desc: "“Blessed be the land of Madriamilak, which has finally been united by the reign of a righteous steward the likes of which has not been seen since our draconic emperor was lost all these centuries ago. Blessed be the land of Madriamilak, whose people cultivate vast amounts of nourishing crops, watered by the rain sent by the great God Amilak.\n\nBlessed be Madriamilak, where the only begrieved ones are the overwrought bureaucrats who have to keep track of all this splendor.”\n- ‘Blessed Shelokmengi’ by Inku Lishan."

 S57_love_and_war_title: "Love And War"
 S57_love_and_war_desc: "Ever since the death of Afwerki III, former king of Shelokmengi, the kingdom has been in control of the nobility and the Queen Almaz zor Fantu-Amru, the widow of Afwerki and mother of Ayufar. These two parties have been opposed to each other, yet they both grudgingly accepted the necessity of a reliable ally.\n\nNegotiating an alliance of three kings was a wise decision to counter the Weriksedar pact led by our enemies in Enikmesiki, yet now the carefully maintained balance within and without needs to be broken. To ensure both her son’s future and the survival of the realm, Queen Shay sought to seal an important marriage pact to turn the tides."

 S57_clearing_the_fields_title: "Clearing The Fields"
 S57_clearing_the_fields_desc: "“My father, slain by the ‘nobles’ of Enikmesiki, betrayed by his once leal lords, my mother forced to raise a child despite growing sickness which took her to her grave. I have not forgotten this slight, and I shall deliver upon them an equal blow.\n\nAnd for our rivals in Werikgeta, they shall know not to cross me or harm my people.” \n-Ayufar II zor Fantu-Amru, at a feast shortly before war with Enikmesiki was announced."

 S57_the_safety_of_shelokmengi_title: "The Safety Of Shelokmengi"
 S57_the_safety_of_shelokmengi_desc: "“Is this right, my Lord?” The philosopher asked his Mezhi, eyes dark with doubt, “We would be betraying our allies, those who have trusted us as loyal and true companions!”\n\n“Indeed, it is something I have no desire to do, but in the name of the realm’s continued safety, we must consider all options.” Replied the Lord, “The southern pass into the lands of the Dakinshi must be secured at all cost, as well as our border to the north. No longer can we suffer raids or the threat of invasion… even if it means the unspeakable.”"

 S57_the_lessons_learnt_title: "The Lessons Learnt"
 S57_the_lessons_learnt_desc: "“I have learned a great deal from the fellow generals my gracious Lord has brought, and from fighting the Dakinshi. I have, I daresay, honed my skills to an extent greater than I ever thought possible.\n\nBut I am retiring from active duty; these bones of mine have become too cumbersome to carry into battle, and I must prepare new officers for your growing forces. However, enclosed within this letter is my suggestion for a successor, he’s proven himself capable, and his planetouched abilities are truly formidable both on and off the battlefield.\n\nWith Honor, \nShay zor Hajo”"

 S57_love_out_of_war_title: "Love Out Of War"
 S57_love_out_of_war_desc: "“Sister, you must be jealous when reading about my adventures, Shelokmengi is a truly wondrous place! The Mezhi has been very kind, and given me a room in one of the taller parts of his palace, allowing me to soar far and wide — so long as I return in time for the scheduled negotiations, of course.\n\nHis demands are simple: We help him construct new temples and other complexes high up in the mountains, close to the sky, and in return we receive citizenship within his realm. I know, I know, you’re probably squawking about ‘sovereignty’ and ‘the independence of the matriarch’, but I have seen the prosperity of Shelokmengi. Perhaps it is time we adapt and be a part of something new.\n\nLove, \nÉrun\nP.S Yes, I am pocketing all of the silver cutlery I’m being given. I’m going to be rich!”"

 S57_wheat_from_the_chaff_title: "Wheat From The Chaff"
 S57_wheat_from_the_chaff_desc: "“Mentor, I have at last arrived at the border with the Shadow Swamp, and the situation is… grim. The trolls and their hag mistresses have caught wind of our presence, and have constructed barricades along the border to their stolen land, just daring us to come take it. And though my power is great, I grow uneasy thinking of the battles to come.\n\nNevertheless, I take heed of your advice. The supply lines are strong, well guarded and swift, and with routes diverse enough that cutting them off will be impossible to do entirely.\n\nWith Honor,\nYafet Kiros”"

 S57_an_expedition_south_title: "An Expedition South"
 S57_an_expedition_south_desc: "“By order of Ayufar II zor Fantu-Amru, you are being tasked with a mission of the utmost importance. The lands south and east of Madriamilak are rich in metals, and the Mezhi has long wished to use these riches for the benefit of Shelokmengi and its people.\n\nTherefore, you are being tasked with moving south and securing these mines, for the good of the realm. General Shay zor Hajo shall lead this expedition.” \n-Order given to Shelokmengi warriors at the start of the famed Southern Expedition."

 S57_quelling_the_beasts_title: "Quelling The Beasts"
 S57_quelling_the_beasts_desc: "“By order of Ayufar II zor Fantu-Amru, you are to head east to the Coffee coast, and bring all who stand in your way to heel. These people are heretics, who do not recognize the glory of Amilak, and as such must be shown the truth, lest they continue down the treacherous path they have chosen.\n\nShay zor Hajo will once again lead this expedition, and as is custom, promotions will be handed out for notable service.”\n-Order given to garrisons around Shelokmengi."

 S57_the_safety_of_madriamilak_title: "The Safety of Madriamilak"
 S57_the_safety_of_madriamilak_desc: "“Long has the shadow haunted us, long have the terrors of the swamp hung over us, long has the protector been absent with no one stepping up to ward his forlorn children. Yet this wicked state of things shall persist no longer. Let all who receive these missives know that Ayufar II zor Fantu-Amru, Mezhi of Shelokmengi, stands firm against the shadow!”"

 S57_fear_of_the_dark_desc: "“When Zenidir scoured the shadows yonder, we cheered and praised him, turning him into the savior of our people, the Lord of the Mengi sent by Amilak Himself! But he is long gone, and now it is up to us to carry on Amilak’s fight against the darkness of his vile brother!\n\nLet it be known in the name of Ayufar, Mezhi of Shelokmengi, that his forces not only stand against the shadows, but seek to drive them back!”\n-Preacher at a town on the border of Madriamilak and the Shadow Swamp."

 flavor_shelokmengi.1.t: "From The Eyes of a Child" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.1.d: "“Mother!” The boy yelped, as the Queen-Mother dragged him to his room by his ear.\n\n“You cannot spend your days out on the fields, you have to study, to hear the pleas of your subjects!”\n\n“But mother!” The boy said, his voice soft and kind, “My regents handle that already, why must I study?”\n\nShe sighed, but forced back tears. “Oh, Ayu, that is the problem.” She leaned in close, whispering in his ear, “Your advisors seek to isolate you, they hope that, once you come of age, you continue to play in the fields, instead of doing your duty, so that they can play as kings.” \n\nUpon hearing this, the boy contemplated, before standing just a little straighter. And though she would never know it, the boy saw how out of breath she was, how deep the lines carved by worry were in her face, and how dark her eyes were. And he would never forget the sight, for all the years he lived."
 flavor_shelokmengi.1.a: "“I understand, Mother.”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.1.tt: "The nobles have control over most of the state's lands, as well as command of the military. Try to decrease their influence and direct land control by the time Ayufar takes power."

 flavor_shelokmengi.2.t: "Long Live the King" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.2.d: "“It was sheer madness!\n\nAyufar stormed into the throne room, guards following him like the thunder follows the lightning. He turned to the nobility, and asked them to join him. He demanded their unreserved acceptance of his reforms and support his plan to put an end to the state of Enikmesiki, for else he would strip them of their ranks and titles, and banish them from their lands.\n\nOf course some, thinking it merely an example of his brazen sense of showmanship, refused him! Now we are going to be sent out to deal with these fools. I had a very simple job before Ayufar took over. When I return, meet me where we first met."
 flavor_shelokmengi.2.a: "- Love, Kebek.”"

 flavor_shelokmengi.3.t: "The Death of a Mother" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.3.d: "The boy sat on his throne, looking out to the court he was now in charge of, to the kingdom he now ruled. He looked to the left and right, seeing the ‘loyal’ lords who had formed his regency council.\n\nShe never got to see him like this; she died the night before his ascent, and she had been buried on a small hill, a tree placed atop her grave as per her request. So loving she was, that she wanted her very grave to provide shade to her people.\n\nHe ignored the endless chatter of his ‘advisors’, who seeked to distract his thoughts with useless trivia, hoping he would bore easily and retire from his duties, thus leaving them with the throne. "
 flavor_shelokmengi.3.a: "He would show them otherwise."

 flavor_shelokmengi.4.t: "A Murder Avenged" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.4.d: "Ayufar stood in what was once a fortress of the Enikmesiki nobility, where they had celebrated slaying his father, carousing and cheering amidst tables burdened with beer and coffee and great roasts.\n\nAnd now he was here, to bring them to heel and right these old wrongs. He would not sully his name with a massacre, but only execute those who would not repent, sparing those who would kneel before his father’s tomb begging for his forgiveness.\n\nAnd now? With the conceited lords of this land laid low with grief over the deserved consequences of their regicide, he was ready to begin his true mission. The lords must be properly instructed, their rights and privileges curtailed to ensure they could never dare to even think of rising up again, all to ensure that there would never be a boy raised without his father, nor a devoted royal mother brought to an early grave by stress-sickness.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice. “What’s next, my Lord?” Berhan Jenas asked.\n\nAyufar gave a radiant smile, and gestured in a direction. “Back home, we have work to do, a cycle to break.”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.4.a: "The next part of the journey starts here."

 flavor_shelokmengi.5.t: "An Expedition Down South" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.5.d: "Shay zor Hajo looked out to the hills, now secured by his men, ensuring the miners continued to do their job, doubly motivated by armed soldiers and promises of higher pay than they were accustomed to from their previous masters. He intently observed the wagons, stacked high with metal ore, moving north, and thus did not notice one of his soldiers approaching, getting startled when the young man spoke.\n\n“Sir, patrols along the route have been set up, the wagons are now safe to move up all the way into Shelokmengi. The Mezhi will be pleased.”\n\n“Indeed, as am I. You have done good work, I’ve seen what you’re capable of, planetouched.” The general took a sip of his coffee, fresh from captured fields, and turned back to the soldier, “And I’ve taken note of your efforts in making sure the miners we’ve secured don’t desert their new master.”\n\n“If I may, sir, it’s because I’d rather be outside of the mine, not inside.”\n\nThis prompted a laugh from Shay. “Spoken like a true soldier, nothing makes a warrior move like the threat of harder work!” He looked out to the wagon trains again. “By Amilak, I’m almost too old for this.”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.5.a: "“Almost.”"

 flavor_shelokmengi.6.t: "The Great Harvest" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.6.d: "“My Lord, I must speak with you,” Berhan seemed furious, prompting the somewhat bemused Mezhi to raise his brows and set down his book. As he strolled over, arms crossed, his trusted advisor exclaimed “Your lords are out of line!”\n\n“Really? And what are they doing?”\n\n“They’re-” The philosopher sputtered, like a wagon’s wheel stuck in silt, “They’re lounging around, or hunting, or doing anything really but their job! How are you supposed to rule when your lords do not do anything?”\n\nAyufar gave a mighty laugh. “When I was a boy, the lords sought for me to do the same. They wanted a fool with a throne, who would feast and hunt and frolic about, but never rule.”\n\n“Are- did you cause this state of affairs intentionally?”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.6.a: "“I have avenged my father. I have made addled fools of ambitious regents.”"

 flavor_shelokmengi.7.t: "Ayufar" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.7.d: "The former Mezhi walked through the fields outside his palace, marvelling at the bounty which lay before him. Up on the cliffs stood a procession of priests, guiding the winds and rains to feed the crops.\n\nHis guards were elsewhere, presumably with his son, the Mezhi; it wasn’t like anyone was going to attack him, of course. So it was just him, and the fruits of his labor. Well, the grain of his labor.\n\nThere was a time, so long ago he barely recalled it, that his mother had dragged him from a spot nearby, and told him in hushed tones that his advisors schemed against him, like the lords across the river who had slain his father. There was a time Berhan would advise him, and Shay would fight for him, and Bati would pray for him, all gone now. Ayufar, defiant to the secret wishes of his nobility, had outlived them all.\n\nHis son would find him sitting with his back to a tree, a smile on his face, his empty gaze overseeing what had once been his domain. Ayufar II zor Fantu-Amru, former Mezhi of Shelokmengi, died fulfilled."
 flavor_shelokmengi.7.a: "We will remember all he has done for us, forever."

 #Events 8 and 9 are for the religious actions and localized with them

 flavor_shelokmengi.10.t: "The Ayufari Dawn" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.10.d: "Ayufar, arms like steel, a studious twinkle in his eyes, pointed at the next man in line. “Step forward, and state your name and occupation.”\nThe man did so, his voice soft like brushing grasses. “My name is Berhan Jenas, I am a philosopher.”\nThe Mezhi smiled. “A philosopher! Tell me, are you one of those ‘High Philosophers’ from across the sea?” He beckoned the man further forwards, the line of other people gingerly following him.\n“No, my lord, though I have studied them as I have many other peoples, from the shapeshifters to the south to the Fangaulans in the far west beyond the Shadow Swamp.”\n“Now tell me, philosopher: What makes a good King?”\nBerhan stammered. “I- that is a complicated question, my lord. Many a man has pondered such a thing. Some say it is piety, adherence to one’s gods. Others say it is authority, the talent to command men.”\n“That is interesting. I think it is wisdom.”\n“Easy to say that, my lord. But if I may, it is oft the Kings who spend their reign seeking wisdom that govern the poorest. One cannot rule from a library.”\nAyufar gave a mighty laugh. “Indeed, indeed! Why else do you think I bring in people from across Madriamilak? Attempting to know everything is folly, and thus I shall consult with experts in every field, so my reforms do not suffer from my arrogant overreach. I will surely enjoy the conversations we will have later, my servants will see you to your quarters while I greet the rest of the guests.”\n\nAs he went silent, a small man stepped forwards and showed Behran the way. And as the philosopher left the throne room, he could not help but look back and see the endless line of experts approaching the throne, like the flow of the mighty Yet."
 flavor_shelokmengi.10.a: "One by one he called their names."

 flavor_shelokmengi.11.t: "Once to the General" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.11.d: "“The most important thing in war is not soldiers or strategy: it is logistics.” Shay zor Hajo spoke, as he rubbed his salt-striped beard. “Men march on their stomachs, and beyond a certain scale foraging strips the land utterly bare. What you need is supply lines. Carts, servants, guards, all of it.”\n“And I assume that becomes a battle in and of itself?” Ayufar replied in between sips of his coffee.\n“Damn right it does! Being beaten in battle can set a war back, losing supplies can end it, and doom an entire army to death, or Amilak forbid, force them into banditry. The amount of jumped up lords claiming to be great military minds who ignore their supply lines scares me.”\n“How about I offer you a place here, so you can keep my less… experienced leaders in line?”\nHe looked at Ayufar with dark eyes burning with an inner fire, and nodded, grinning yellowed teeth. “Perhaps I shall take you up on it. It would do me good to whip these fools into shape, and to command the soldiers of your realm! I will begin at once!”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.11.a: "This soldier will do us good."

 flavor_shelokmengi.12.t: "Second to the Priest" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.12.d: "“The water we bring to the fields does not simply disappear once it has watered the crops,” proclaimed Bati Goshan, a local rain priest, gesturing lightly with one hand to illustrate his lecture. “Water is part of an eternal cycle as willed by Amilak, and it is the duty of the priesthood to support this cycle to aid His children.”\n\n“But if done poorly, that can cause issues?” Asked Ayufar, who reclined on his couch as the priest spoke to him.\n\nBati frowned. “I have seen some farmlands stripped bare by drought, and flash floods rip others apart so that they may not be fertile for many years. We have been given a great gift, to guide the flow of the winds and rains, but used with ignorance ´this can lead to a destruction greater than anything but what the Shadow Swamp could bestow.”\n\nAyufar sat straight, clasping his hands together. “Well then, we better get started. I’ll be shortly calling priests from across the realm to better coordinate our rainfall.” He put a hand on Bati’s shoulder, “And I would like you to lead it, I find your oration very convincing.”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.12.a: "This priest will do us good."

 flavor_shelokmengi.13.t: "Third to the Farmer" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.13.d: "“They think your job is just ‘sow, reap, sow, reap’, they don’t consider how back-breaking the whole thing is!” Heyle Iyesu ranted, as Ayufar simply nodded, and patted him on the back with an understanding motion.\n\n“Indeed, I was hoping I could come to understand the specifics of your vocation. I want to apply your experience to all the fields of Shelokmengi. I would rather not leave it to the nobility, when the peasants are the ones actually doing the work.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the farmer smiled, and began regaling Ayufar with a torrent of useful information about concepts such as irrigation – which the Mezhi had a scribe feverishly record – as well as the various antics he had gotten up to over the years.\n\nAfter both had a good laugh, they departed, the farmer to his field, and the Mezhi to his throne."
 flavor_shelokmengi.13.a: "These farmers will do us good."

 flavor_shelokmengi.14.t: "A Long Awaited Rest" 
 flavor_shelokmengi.14.d: "“I do not understand!” the Philosopher cried out to the Mezhi, “You have been the greatest king Shelokmengi has ever had, Why would you abdicate!?”\n\nAyufar turned to meet his most loyal advisor, his movements not quite as sharp as they once were. “Ah, Berhan, you do not see. My hair whitens like the snow peaks of the Pakreda Sedara to the south. My vision darkens like the sunless midnight sky. And my mind becomes frequently fanciful. I am no longer fit for-”\n\n“Lies! You are still capable, you are having this conversation with me right now!”\n\nThe Mezhi sighed. “Berhan, I do not want to die upon my throne, and have my sons crown themselves, weeping, before performing my duty. It is not a pleasant experience, I can tell you this much. I would prefer to spend my final days in the fields, or amongst my family.” And he put his hand on the philosopher’s shoulder, “And I would prefer you to grant your sage counsel to my sons as you did for me.”"
 flavor_shelokmengi.14.a: "“I… I understand, my Lord.”"

 #Breadbasket Events
 flavor_shelokmengi.100.t: "Harvest Report"
 flavor_shelokmengi.tt: "Your level of §GBreadbasket§! has changed!"
 flavor_shelokmengi.100.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], dire news from the Yenaze Mezhi! This year’s harvest has come in and… in effect, it has not. What meagre fields we possess are insufficient or simply lie fallow due to lack of sufficient labour, and are barely enough for the peasantry to sustain themselves with. We have been reduced to importing grain from other nations, much to our dismay. The populace is outraged, branding us “cereal killers” after a spate of deaths to starvation. Private granaries are being ransacked by hungry peasants even as nobles are being beaten in the streets for their failure to ensure a good harvest, and this trend looks likely to continue until we resolve this issue."
