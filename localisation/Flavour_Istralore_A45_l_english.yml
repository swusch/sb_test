A45_silence_of_the_bards_title: "Silence of the Bards"
A45_silence_of_the_bards_desc: "The end of the Lilac Wars brought with it great tragedy, but while many greater wrongs still have yet to be righted, there is a far more personal grudge that must first be settled. In fair Seinathil, a branch family of our Duchess' own Silistra family rules the small nation of bards. They are poets, not warriors. Perhaps that is why they saw fit to turn their backs on the main branch of the family, and their oaths to the Emperor by siding with the Rose party. This stain on our ruling dynasty's good name will not be tolerated, and we must bring Senathil to account for its traitorous actions. After all, for bards who twist words around frivolously to change their meaning, do oaths really hold any value? We must teach them that they do."

A45_raising_a_renaissance_title: "Raising a Renaissance"
A45_raising_a_renaissance_desc: "Across Cannor a new age of culture and knowledge blooms, as scholars and artists funded by the wealthy and powerful of Anbennar delve into the knowledge of the past, our Castanorian and Damerian forebears. Were the grand duchy alive today no doubt it would be the centre of old Damerian revival, but no matter. As her inheritor it shall be we that sponsors the said revival, our own perspective added atop. With the Duchess's example it has become clear to us that change is necessary, particularly as it concerns the women of our realm."

A45_women_in_the_workforce_title: "Women in the Workforce"
A45_women_in_the_workforce_desc: "Compared to much of Halann, it is undoubtedly true that Istralore has little discrimination between its sexes. Elves hold no such notions of differing merit, and it is from them that we inherit our attitudes. Still, it is also true that in our fields and our mines it remains mostly men that toil. Why should it be so? To deprive the tools of another hand? Let us encourage our women too to work outside the home."

A45_by_her_light_title: "By Her Light"
A45_by_her_light_desc: "With each passing day it becomes more and more clear we were right to put our faith in Corin. Not that we doubted in the first place of course, but our swift strides in setting right the tragic consequences of the lilac wars can only be the sign of the goddesses favour - surely she is pleased! We consider ourselves amongst her foremost adherents on Halann, and it is only right that we should act the part."

A45_rose_covered_twilight_title: "Rose Covered Twilight"
A45_rose_covered_twilight_desc: "Once we bathed in the sweet pale light of the moon.\n\nFor long years we knew our place - knew our duty and purpose - the right hand of Dameria, her first and most loyal vassal. Those times are gone now, our light snuffed out by the suffocating rose and its traitorous supplicants, imperial princes without a shred of honour of loyalty. To believe that those of Wesdam could bear the name Silmuna and betray their own blood is almost unthinkable, yet sometimes reality is worse than nightmare.\n\nAll such oathbreakers will earn their just deserts sooner or later, but our attention must turn to our own borders first. The snake duke of Cesitrande eyes our lands with greed, thinking us weak and exhausted, our duchess young and inexperienced. He may be right, but he forgets our spirit. Even in the twilight we shall shine."

A45_the_broken_lance_title: "The Broken Lance"
A45_the_broken_lance_desc: "Duke Vincen sil Cestir, lord of Cestirande, of men more vile there are few.\n\nFamous for his wit, the sly duke was once a vassal of our mother Dameria, only to turn coat the disastrous battle of the moon council. Ever the opportunist, there he renounced his loyalty to his rightful liege, branding Adenn Skylance “Brokenlance of the Waning Moon” in scorn.\n\nNow he delivers to us a snapped spear, emblazoned with Adenn's own crest, a cruel provocation - no doubt meant to goad us into rash action. He will succeed, at least in that, but he knows not the fury he brings upon himself. Our Aucanna may be young, but she knows war, and the serpentine duke will learn Istralore still has bite."

A45_revive_the_banshees_title: "Revive the Banshees"
A45_revive_the_banshees_desc: "The Istralari Banshees - the screaming warrior-women adherents of our great namesake Istralania Warsinger herself - are in a dire way. Depleted and run ragged by their service in the lilac wars, our elite all woman regiment is practically disbanded in all but name. This sorry state of affairs clearly cannot continue, but it will take a great effort to revive and reforge the Banshees anew. Still, peace and victory give us the opportunity and inspiration to do so, and with some effort, soon new hopefuls will flock to the Warsingers banner."

A45_homecoming_title: "Homecoming"
A45_homecoming_desc: "With the commons and eastern damesear under our benevolent control, the rest of the damerian core territories now cry out for liberation from their tyrannical and traitorous overlords. We shall send our armies west, and bring them back into the fold, for all damerians must ultimately be united under one banner.\n\nAs for the matter of Wesdam, kinslayers and oathbreakers, there can be no mercy. They are no true Silmunas, they forsook that name when they sided with the rose, and their claim to the west dameshead is null and void. We shall see them stamped from existence."

A45_flame_in_the_dawn_title: "Flame in the Dawn"
A45_flame_in_the_dawn_desc: "Hope is a fragile and fickle thing, but always it endures. Here in darkness it can be hard to see the light, yet we look to the east and see a flame.\n\nThe newly ascended Goddess Corin is that flame, and the hope she offers is that good can triumph over evil - even when that evil seems insurmountable, an unending tide breaking all that is known and right. Like Corin, and like Istralania before her, we will gird ourselves for battle and hold hope in our hearts."

A45_the_grand_tournament_title: "The Grand Tournament"
A45_the_grand_tournament_desc: "To our hall comes news of a great tournament, rich and lavish, to be attended by lords and ladies the empire over. A gesture of peace from the new Emperor, a celebration of a fresh start. Hah! As if fake war and fights made farce could ever make us forget our fallen friends or forgive our fickle foes.\n\nPerhaps we should simply not attend and take a stand against the false peace on offer, but the Duchess has another idea. We shall send a competitor, one seasoned by war and conflict, a competitor who shall fight under the banner of the moon."

A45_loyal_to_the_last_title: "Loyal to the Last"
A45_loyal_to_the_last_desc: "It is perhaps shameful to admit, but we were not the last of the moon's light to dim. That honour goes to the Orda Aldresia, imperial bodyguard, who for all the world seemed determined to fight to the last. Though they did not, we should thank them for it, for such men and women of honour already bitterly resented their service to a usurper, and now with his true treachery revealed surely shall not need much of a push to stand behind us - Damerias true heir!"

A45_dreams_of_dameria_title: "Dreams of Dameria"
A45_dreams_of_dameria_desc: "They say that Dameria is dead, a shattered realm nary to rise again, but we know better - for Dameria lives in us.\n\nFrom the moment we reclaimed the middle luna we have staked our claim as Dameria’s Heir, and now it is time at last to carry that claim against the great usurper. The commons and the eastern damesear languish even now under the Wexonard yoke, their peoples squeezed beneath that cruel thumb. Our armies stand ready, and soon Anbennar will see that the dream of Dameria is not dead."

A45_damerias_heir_title: "Dameria's Heir"
A45_damerias_heir_desc: "Not even the greatest of fools can deny we are Dameria’s heir, now that we wear her great mantle and her lands prosper under our rule. We know that Adénn and Vincen would be proud of us, and no doubt Istralania and Munas would smile to see their realms combined, yet some questions still linger.\n\nIn the time since old Dameria fell, we of Istralore have had to strike out as our own people, and in so doing have become something more than what we were before. Are we simply the dutiful restorer we once were? Shall we be content to rule as the Silmuna’s - to sit atop the dove throne and preside from above, righteous and silver tongued? Or is our lot to be a new type of Emperor, an Emperor who holds their own sword one who leads from the front.\n\nSome small things remain to be settled before the question of Dameria can be resolved, not least of which Anbenncost returned to the realm, but the question of our identity must be settled, and soon."

A45_his_final_moments_title: "His Final Moments"
A45_his_final_moments_desc: "The Story of Adenn Skylance ends with his death in an honourable duel at the hands of the usurper - at least, so says he. This rings hollow to the ear, for how could the greatest warrior of the day lose in single combat to such an inferior foe, lacking strength of arm and righteousness of heart?\n\nSurely the usurper's magic played a role, a truth that must be exposed so the good princes of the empire may all see the usurper for what he truly is, liar and forsaker. With the aid of our mages, perhaps the truth may be divined by spell and scrying, mayhaps we can peer into the past and see our lieges' final moments."

A45_to_tame_wyverns_title: "To Tame Wyverns"
A45_to_tame_wyverns_desc: "The men of Verne claim the wyvern as their banner, a mighty symbol and a mighty beast indeed. It is a tragedy then that the wyvern is no longer ridden, a knowledge that was burnt by the Dukes when Verne was conquered by Dameria some two centuries ago.\n\nWord comes from the court of Verne that the new Duke has found a hidden cache of scrolls with the ancient techniques, and now seeks to bind Wyverns to his cause anew. As our staunch ally, it is only right we should lend our aid to his effort, so that Verne may once again send Wyvern to war."

A45_moonrise_on_bal_hyl_title: "Moonrise on Bal Hyl"
A45_moonrise_on_bal_hyl_desc: "The stolen lands of Dameria may be restored to us, but let us not forget in our jubilation that the Wexonard usurpers and their allies still persist, cowering in their ‘Wexkeep’. Bal Hyl it was called before them, an ancient castanorian citadel. It is undeniably beautiful, its lofty walls atop the hills towering over the landscape around. A shame then it is darkened by the stain of its owners, a blight that we shall have to burn away before it might glitter under the moonlight once more."

A45_fallen_lilac_petals_title: "Fallen Lilac Petals"
A45_fallen_lilac_petals_desc: "Dameria as we knew it may be gone, but not all is lost. Many of our friends and allies are now as we, bruised, perhaps battered, but not broken. We must be to them now what Dameria once was to us, a friend, an ally, a source of unity. Together we shall endeavour to survive in the usurpers new Anbennar, and yet still change the futures course.\n\nOf all the things broken in the lilac wars, of all the fallen petals strewn around, the bonds forged between us are not one."

A45_remnant_remembrance_title: "Remnant Rembrance"
A45_remnant_remembrance_desc: "Long have the elves of moonhaven been our allies and neighbours, fellow loyal vassals of dameria, stalwart of the eastern dameshead. They are the natural first course in our journey to reunite the shattered moon party.\n\nElven blood may have centuries since dispersed throughout the veins of our rulers - the illustrious Silistra dynasty - but we still can claim the same heritage as they, from the elves of the remnant fleet. We shall have need of a navy in the times to come, so let us raise now a mighty fleet, and invite the elves to partake in the effort together - perhaps this homage to the origin of elves in Cannor will kindle hope as did the first arrival."

A45_istralari_ironworks_title: "Istralari Ironworks"
A45_istralari_ironworks_desc: "The dwarves of Silverforge have long toiled to build their hold, a monumental endeavour for which they have delved deep and greedily into the earth, yet still much more remains to be done. Our own dalemines produce some of the finest iron in Anbennar, and surely our dwarvish friends would appreciate it if we shared that bounty with them. Though we have no doubt our contribution will be ultimately meagre in their work, toil shared is toil lessened."

A45_corins_truth_title: "Corin's Truth"
A45_corins_truth_desc: "Now we see the reason - nay, the need - for her ascension! Castelos is dead, and has been dead for many long centuries! Praise Corin, who came to save man from the orcs when no god could. Praise Corin, the sword and shield of civilised peoples.\n\nIt is clear she must lead the court, her claim through Agrados is undeniable, though Adean may be Castellos’s son his failure to act against the greentide is a sure sign of his unworthiness, not as a god of course, but as a ruler. Corin has no such flaw, she shall not fail to act in future. We must declare for her cause, she shall need our support here on Halann, as we shall need hers above!"

A45_corins_sword_title: "Corin's Sword"
A45_corins_sword_desc: "The writings of Bluetusk speak of Corins Sword and Shield - the importance both of vanquishing evil and protecting what is dear, as she did when she slayed the dookanson with the thrust of her sword, whilst blocking his killing blow with her shield. We well understand the role of shield already, and must not fall to the same flaw as the Adeanics - to become dormant in protection. Thus it is time to take up the sword, and carry the word of our Goddess out against the world's evil!"

A45_in_her_image_title: "In Her Image"
A45_in_her_image_desc: "“As without, within.” - Nesta, Istralari Banshee Commander\n\nTo crusade in Corins name is to be righteous, for to rid the world of evil is the noblest of causes. Despite that, we must remember that it is not enough to wield the sword, the shield too cannot be neglected. As we do without we must do within, and hold ourselves and our subjects to the standards of our great goddess - but to imagine each man or woman may be righteous on their own merit is folly. Never forget that Corin did not stand alone. By promoting the emergent holy order, and constructing new martial communities across our realm, neither shall any Istralari."

A45_the_warsong_college_title: "The Warsong College"
A45_the_warsong_college_desc: "The education of our people combined with the martial culture we have instilled across our land has had quite a clear consequence, and now the best and brightest of our youth clamour for the opportunity to study war at a deeper level. Inspired and impressed by our commanders, so too across the empire do nobles and commoners alike seek the opportunity to send their sons and daughters to be trained in our ways.\n\nThe demand is flattering of course, and a testament to the virtue of our ways, but our existing infrastructure strains under it. Higher education has traditionally been reserved to the domain of the privileged, typically sons of the wealthy and noble. Let us change this. In Rincancas we shall raise a new institution, one who’s doors shall be open to any with ability, regardless of their sex or station. In memory of our founder, let it be known as Warsong."

A45_divine_demense_divided_title: "Divided Divine Domain"
A45_divine_demense_divided_desc: "The crimson deluge has ended, yet the struggle of the gods is not over - not till Adean admits his unworth to lead the court and bends his knee before Castelos’s true and rightful successor!\n\nThe conflict cannot be solved in the heavens, for a second godswar would be a terrible thing, and so we are charged with its resolution on Halann. When his supporters are defeated, when their weapons are laid down and Corins truth accepted in their hearts, Adean himself shall see his folly."

A45_upon_halann_as_in_heaven_title: "Upon Halann as in Heaven"
A45_upon_halann_as_in_heaven_desc: "It is over, and we have triumphed.\n\nCorins banner flies over the empire, and the members of her league gather at her altar. No doubt in the very heavens she now ascends Castellos seat - as well she should! Though Adeans' simpering supporters cling on, they are a dying sect, and it is time to be done with them.\n\nBy our Imperial right, we henceforth decree all subjects of Anbennar must adhere to her worship.\nBy our Imperial might, we shall enforce her supremacy across Anbennar."

A45_heavenly_authority_title: "Heavenly Authority"
A45_heavenly_authority_desc: "Across the empire spreads a strange kind of affliction, one that comes bearing charity and spreads learning. To first glance, the Ravelians would seem a great boon, for it is of course good to be concerned with the place of the commons. Yet to take a closer look reveals a core that slowly rots. These so-called scholars and intellectuals pay not the proper deference to the divine! They use words like ‘saint’ for holy figures, and heed the word of a talking stone. They must be cast forth from the realm, rooted out wherever they nest - by our authority, and heavens!"

A45_blending_the_bloodlines_title: "Blending the Bloodlines"
A45_blending_the_bloodlines_desc: "To many, the name Silmuna was synonymous with the Emperorship, the Moon well settled upon the Dove Throne. Our own line is illustrious to be sure, but not so nearly tied with prestige and respect as the Silmunas. We shall have to learn from their example to legitimise our bloodline, marriage and prettied words our weapons.\n\nOne opportunity lies in Escann. Not all living Silmunas are traitors to the name, Rogier Silmuna having escaped the Lilac wars and settled in Escann, where he found Lothane Bluetusk and recognised him as trueblood. Now Lothanes line represents the true legitimate line, and by arranging a marriage between those of his blood and ours we too can share in the Silmuna name. The marriage will provide a lovely consort too, even if they are a bit… green."

A45_folding_in_the_family_title: "Folding in the Family"
A45_folding_in_the_family_desc: "Unity has given us strength beyond measure, strength enough to right the wrongs of history. Is it not right then, that we should aspire to ever closer union with our friends and allies? Those faithful who did not give up the cause, even when the moon had seemed to wane, deserve a place of honour not simply as mere princes, but as our valued and respected vassals. They may find this privilege hard to accept at first, for those of such true heart do, so we shall take up their causes to persuade them to our view - and for those who even then still wish to stand apart we shall be glad to."

A45_the_businori_bridgehead_title: "The Businori Bridgehead"
A45_the_businori_bridgehead_desc: "With our home secured at last, the eye may turn outward again - the sword hot to the hand.\n\nTo the south lies the region of Businor, land of the stone lions and gateway to the divenhal, long a bastion of independent kingdoms who refused the promise of Anbennar. Now we hear it becomes budding home to the Ravelian society, thinkers who whisper questions that border on heresy. Whatever the case may be, it is undeniable that an independent Businor is a threat to the security and prosperity of Anbennar. From behind the Khenak range any enemy may launch raids into our territory, threatening our territorial integrity, and from the isle of Tef traders intercept goods and wealth flowing from the newly discovered territories overseas before they reach the dameshead - leaving us second pickings!\n\nThe solution to these problems is simple. Businori will be brought into the empire and shown the light of Corin, one way or another."

A45_take_to_the_waves_title: "Take to the Waves"
A45_take_to_the_waves_desc: "For many long decades have the coasts of Anbennar known the presence of Akasi pirates, the gnolls of Viakkoc in particular so notorious as to earn the name Seascourge. Of course we have always protected our coasts as best we could, but the unending period of internal strife has prevented us from doing as we should and bringing a conclusive end to the threat.\n\nNo more should innocent Istralori suffer from the raiding and pillaging of demon worshippers! Let us rally to our banner, and raise a great host upon the sea - under the sealion banner we take to the waves once more!"

A45_khamshes_ek_kusret_title: "Khamshes ek Kusret"
A45_khamshes_ek_kusret_desc: "With peace at home, Businor secured as a bridgehead and our great navy raised, now is the time - Akasik shall be pacified.\n\nAcross the Divenhal we shall sail, and upon those distant shores we will liberate the poor peoples of Akasik from their rotten rulers. In so doing shall we end the threat of piracy once and for all, but equally as importantly we shall bring a new people into the congregation of the faithful.\n\nCorins word shall find fertile soil in Akasik, for many of them have broken from their theology of cycles already, seeing Corin as the saviour they so desperately need to change their fortune. Yet they by and large consider her as an ‘agent’ of their mother Akasik, a grandiose mistake to be sure, but one we shall be happy to correct. They shall take up the sword and shield as have we - the Khamshes et Kusret!"

A45_anbennar_means_title: "Anbennar Means..."
A45_anbennar_means_desc: "What is Anbennar?\n\nA promise perhaps. A promise of peace, an end to the squabbling of the interregnum. But it is more than that too, for a promise is only a word, at most a pact. Anbennar is not simply an oath, it is a realm, an entity unto itself. Anbennar lives in the mind of every life in its borders, it exists within us as much as outside. Then is Anbennar simply a kingdom, an empire, as many others claim to be across the breadth of Halann? Surely not, for there are none like us. Who else can claim to have elected their emperors, who else can claim to be many peoples, yet also one?\n\nAnbennar is neither of these things, for Anbennar is both. Anbennar is the past, and it is the future. Anbennars destiny is to be one, and we shall bring that destiny to fruition."

A45_marshal_of_the_empire_title: "Marshal of the Empire"
A45_marshal_of_the_empire_desc: "Since the founding of Anbennar, Istralore has been Marshal of the Empire, and even before that we loyally served as the same under the kingdom of Dameria. Now we are Emperors ourselves, and we may even grant the title of Marshall to another should we so choose, but never shall we forget our martial heritage. It is the privilege of the emperor to levy the princes for war, but in recent times this authority has waned. Now that we sit the dove throne, it shall be our priority to re-establish that ancient right."

A45_liberty_title:0"Liberty"
A45_liberty_desc: "We Istralari know duty. Duty is purpose, and cause, responsibility. So when as Emperor we find ourselves charged with the protection of Anbennar, with the integrity of the realm and the security of her princes, we take that charge seriously. Thus, looking at the borders to find princely states and provinces sat under the heel of foreign masters is a situation we cannot abide. Traitor Emperors may have been content to let their lorentish masters carve away chunks of the realm, but not we. Never we - let us instead bring liberty."

A45_the_fifth_lilac_war_title: "The Fifth Lilac War"
A45_the_fifth_lilac_war_desc: "The world may have thought the lilac wars ended with Dameria, but that is a lie. The lilac wars only paused, for as long as we draw breath the cause is not ended - it was only better not to be a martyr, better to bide time and wait, as we have.\nNow the moon waxes once again. The empire is united beneath us, no traitors wait to sabotage us from within, no cowards nor kinslayers lay with daggers for our backs. Lorent will quake for our coming. The Redfort shall fall, and Lorentaine will burn - with the warsong of the Banshees as the music of their demise."

A45_the_moon_shines_title: "The Moon Shines"
A45_the_moon_shines_desc: "All across Lencenor, word of the shall of Lorentaine spreads like wildfire. To the adherents of the rose it is the very essence of despair, and perhaps to whatever remnant cells of our once while allies yet still remain it is a message of hope. Istralore comes, and she brings the empire with her!\n\nAcross the length of the land our armies will march, bringing with them both Anbennars unity and Corins truth. Above them shall fly the banner of the Sealion and Moon both, for this is as much Dameria’s victory as it is ours. Let this be a testament to dedication and duty. No matter what tragedy may befall a cause, the fight is not over until the last believer's breath runs out. For as long as one Istralari held a sword the moon did not yet wane entirely - and now she shines above Lencenor anew."

A45_and_the_admirals_title: "And the Admirals"
A45_and_the_admirals_desc: "Just across the Damesneck lies Neckcliff, home of the imperial Admiralty. Another loyal Damerian vassal in times gone by, the lords of Neckcliff were as to the waves as we to the land. It is almost negligent of us to have neglected a faithful ally for so long, but their position isolated on the west dameshead - surrounded by the thorns of the rose - made them a poor choice for assisting with the usurper. Now that the Dove throne is restored to a worthy owner, it is time we move to bring the admirals back into the fold. To demonstrate our commitment to them, one of our own has suggested a grand project - the reconstruction of the Estádha, the elven arcship once captained by our founder, Istralania Warsinger. "

A45_prosperity_title: "Prosperity"
A45_prosperity_desc: "“Come ashore friend, you’re in the greatest country in the world now.” - unknown Anbenncóst dockworker.\n\nAs the inheritor of Dameria, Istralore shines as a beacon for Anbennar. A model of what a nation can be, of how a people can live, united in peace and faith. All the wealth of the world flows here to the dameshead, and it is to the envy of the world to be born a Damerian. Never let it be said that the Istralari are content to sit idly in their prosperity however. No, prosperity demands continuous effort, and constant improvement. Let us set our hand to booming industry, and put bread in the hand of every citizen!"

istralore.1.t: "Sparks of Hope"
istralore.1.d: "Duchess Aucanna was devastated; her grief threatened to overwhelm her. Adenn was dead, Dameria was gone, and traitors and fools ruled the Empire she called home. The defeat of the Damerian Moon Party was complete and resounding, and Aucanna couldn’t accept it. The others had moved on, and many had accepted the status quo as if the decades of honor and loyalty to Dameria had meant nothing. As if Adenn had meant nothing. She’d never stop hating them for it. The other princes in the Empire might bow and scrape before the Wexonard bastards as if they were rightful rulers, but Aucanna would never forget the blood spilled to put them there.\n\nBut what could she do? To defy the Wexonards would spell the end of Istralore, the end of the Silistra line. Her people needed her, and so for them, she would keep her desire for vengeance in check. She needed strength to get back on her feet…she had been dragging herself along for too long. She needed to be strong like Corin had been, the hero who had so valiantly fought against the Greentide and given her life to bring its end. Corin had fought for what she believed; she had fought against evil and injustice, and Aucanna knew that was who she needed to be. She would get back up, she would fight, she would protect her people and the empire that Dameria had built. Dameria might be gone, but she was not. She would carry the memory of Dameria with her and guide her people with honor and strength. Corin-willing, perhaps Dameria could live again in Istralore. Aucanna could live with that."
istralore.1.a: "May Corin guide us through these trying times."
istralore.2.t: "Our Own Family"
istralore.2.d: "Since the arrival of the Remnant Fleet in Cannor, the lands of Istralore have been ruled by the fair and wise descendants of Istralania Warsinger. The rule of the House of Silistra has never been called into question in Istralore, the ‘Marshals of the Empire’, a title that some would apply to both Istralore and its ruling family. To be Silistra is to be a commander, a warrior, and to live with honor and integrity; as such, the Silistras of Istralore have long been respected throughout the Empire. However, the Silistra family is not only found in Istralore. The small nation of Seinathíl, Land of the Bards, is ruled by a branch family of the illustrious Silistra house.\n\nNo one knows how the split happened. Istralorian records don’t make any mention of such a split, and the one time an envoy was gauche enough to ask the Seinathíli diplomat present broke into an utterly outrageous story concerning about a blasphemous tryst between Istralania, her husband, and Munas Moonsinger’s lesser known half-brother. The far more likely version is that a cousin of our ruler at the time of the split inherited the lands through marriage, and made them their own. However, the Bards’ propensity to tell tall tales even about their own house reveals them for what they are: liars and oathbreakers. They turned their backs on their own kin during the Lilac Wars, and that is a disgrace to the Silistra name not easily forgiven. We must show them the error of their ways and unite the Silistra family once more… but how should we approach these crafty poets?"
istralore.2.a: "The way of the Bards: with honeyed words and wine."
istralore.2.b: "The way of the Marshals: by a formal challenge for the throne."
istralore.2.c: "Not at all: the Silistra family is gone in Seinathil."
istralore.3.t: "By Corin's Light"
istralore.3.d: "We have long been champions of Corin. Now a new religion has sprung up in her name, we should take up the mantle and lead the charge of the reformation."
istralore.3.a: "My life for Corin!"
istralore.3.b: "On second thought, we like things how they are."
istralore.4.t: "Rise of the Banshees"
istralore.4.d: "Nesta looked around, surveying the future battlefield with the reflexive tactical analysis that had been instilled into her by months of constant drills and training. This would be her first major command, and the half-elf warrior wanted to give her troops all the advantages she could find. Behind her, the second member of her team, Gwyneth, approached on horseback.\n\n“We have this in the bag, Nes. General Cassian trained us too well for us to struggle with a simple battle like this.”\n\nNesta glanced at her. On horseback in the sunlight, Gwyn’s red hair shone brilliantly like the Goddess they were trying to emulate, and Nesta knew she was right. Nesta smiled, a contortion that still felt a little unnatural. The pressures of being a woman at court had been demanding. She had always been too tall, too rude, and too crass to be considered a proper lady. The Warsinger movement, and joining the Banshees, had proven the best decision she’d ever made.\n\nThe final member, Emerie, approached her fellow warriors. “What are you still chatting about? We have a battle to win!” Nesta smiled. Together, the three of them were invincible. They had gone through hell with their training together. With her friends she prepared to march to battle. For honor. For Istralore. For Corin."
istralore.4.a: "The legend of the Banshees begins anew."
istralore.5.t: "The Mystery Knight"
istralore.5.d: "The stands were filled on the grounds of Wexkeep. The fortress was playing host to a Grand Tournament, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since before the Lilac Wars.. Food was shared, bets were placed, and most all the noble houses were present to watch their knights. The Duke of Wex was pleased. Almost all the banners of import in the empire were present; the only notable absentee was Duchess Aucanna of Istralore. That was no surprise, nor much of a shame. She’d never willingly set foot in Wexkeep, a place she held so much contempt for. The Duke of Wex decided to enjoy her absence. Aucanna was inept at social events. Politics, after all, was a long and dangerous game.\n\nJousting, it seemed, was not nearly so complicated. The final bout of the tournament was about to begin, and the matchup was causing a stir. One of the finalists was an unnamed warrior who had only put his name down as “The Blade of the Dales.” The man was on the short side, wearing well-worn chain mail and a full helm to hide his face. He was unassuming and many had expected him to go home in failure after his first bout.\n\nBut the warrior was good, and though he was small he quickly proved that his body was compact with hard muscle, outplaying and overpowering almost every other contestant. His jousts almost always ended with him knocking his opponent off their horse and continuing the bout on foot, the size difference apparently meaningless. For the finals, he flew the flag of Dameria, causing a huge stir. The Duke frowned: he had planned to make this boy a knight of Wex, but this was near treason.\n\nAs expected, the Blade won the finals easily. The Vernman who had made it to the other spot in the finals was made to look like a child with the way the Blade easily dispatched him from his horse, prompting several jokes from the royal stands about how well Vernman ride horses. The Blade helped his opponent to his feet with honor, then turned to address the Duke of Wex, to acknowledge his victory. The Blade removed the full helm, and long hair flowed out, blowing in the wind.\n\nDuchess Aucanna of Istralore stood upon the field; she threw a single wilted rose from her pocket into the stands. She only said one sentence before storming off, a powerful statement that all in the stands could clearly hear."
istralore.5.a: "“Enjoy the dawn hours of your reign, the moon will soon rise upon it.”"
istralore.6.t: "The Lance is Broken"
istralore.6.d: "Hey, Istralore returned our cores to us. Maybe we should give them some of our clay in return so they dont dec on us."
istralore.6.a: "Sure thing, lets make a trade"
istralore.6.b: "Lol, should have gotten it in writing!"
istralore.7.t: "Thanallen Returned"
istralore.7.d: "We returned Whistlepoint to Galeinn, and they have responded by rewarding us with the territory of Thanallen."
istralore.7.a: "Excellent"
istralore.8.t: "Thanallen Denied"
istralore.8.d: "We returned Whistlepoint to Galeinn, but they have decided that they are going in a different direction and our request for reciprocal land has been denied."
istralore.8.a: "Damn them!"
istralore.9.t: "A Question of Loyalty"
istralore.9.d: "Istralore is making a bid to revive Dameria, and is attempting to appeal to the Grandmaster to side with them, the true heirs to the Grand Duchy's legacy, over the Wexonards we currently serve."
istralore.9.a: "We will join Istralore's fight."
istralore.9.b: "The Empire we once swore our oath to is gone, and that which remains is divided amongst itself. We will go our own path."
istralore.9.c: "Our loyalty lies with the Emperor."
istralore.10.t: "Imperial Identity"
istralore.10.d: "At long last, we have reclaimed the lands of lost Dameria. As her chosen heir, it has been our duty since she fell to honor her and reunite what had been broken in the disastrous Lilac Wars. Now here we sit, upon the legacy of our former overlord, with legitimate claim to their title. Should we so choose, Dameria will live again, stronger and more united than ever before. This is the reality we have been striving towards.\n\nAnd yet, not all is as clear as it once was. Things have changed since Dameria’s fall, and we have found our own voice. We have accepted Corin, and we have embraced the heritage of Istralania Warsinger. Our current voice is one that celebrates our heritage of proud warriors and loyalty to Corin. To embrace Dameria and return to the past would mean to abandon these new ideas that we have become so proud of. Perhaps we can honor Dameria’s legacy not by reviving them, but by succeeding them. Perhaps we can become something new, an Istralore that soars higher than Dameria ever did.\n\nAnd thus, we are faced with the most important question of our nation’s history. Who are we? Do we rekindle the flames of the past and revive Dameria, taking their name and customs? Or do we seek to make something new, and forge ahead as an independent and proud Istralore?"
istralore.10.a: "We are Dameria Reborn!"
istralore.10.b: "We are and always will be the Daughters of the Warsinger, Istralore."
istralore.11.t: "The Duel"
istralore.11.d: "The mages of Istralore had gathered together, preparing to perform their spell. A work of this caliber required many hands and intense concentration to make work. They were going to scry into the past, and show an entire room filled with nobility the images in real time. This was ambitious, even for a collective of mages in one of the strongest nations in the Empire, but the nobles were adamant. They needed to see how the 4th Lilac War had ended; they needed to see its final moments.\n\nThe mages began, and the scrying began, a magical recreation of the past appearing before all the nobles gathered. Suddenly they were shown Anbenncost, the space before the Dove Throne itself. Several of the nobles gasped as they saw the figure standing before it: Adenn Silmuna, Emperor of Anbennar, Archduke of Dameria, and leader of the Moon Party in the Lilac War. Across from him, in a dueling stance, was Lothane sil Wex III, the Usurper. This was it.\n\nThe duel began, both men trained warriors of incredible skill, launching into a battle worthy of all the great heroes of legend. Though they knew it was just a magical recreation, several of the Istralorian nobles found themselves cheering their Emperor on as he fought for his life. Then, as if spurred on by the cheers from the future, the recreation of Adenn struck a blow; Lothane lost his footing. That one mistake was all Adenn needed, placing his sword to Lothane’s neck. He had won, and he was allowing Lothane to see his victory before he died.\n\nThe image grew shaky, as even the mages were unnerved. Adenn won? Impossible. He was the one who had lost his life that night – how did Lothane survive from here? Suddenly, Adenn cried out as he was stabbed, a sword skewering him from behind. The sanctity of the duel had been broken, Adenn felled by a cowardly strike from a third man, one who intervened to save Lothane. Erlan Silmuna, Marquis of Wesdam. As Adenn’s life began to fade, so did the spell. However, before the dying emperor’s eyes, Lothane got to his feet, reclaimed his weapon, and stuck it through the man who gave Adenn his mortal blow, tying up any loose ends."
istralore.11.a: "The keep was silent, the calm before the storm of truth."
istralore.12.t: "The Chastening of Wex"
istralore.12.d: "Revenge. A powerful word. Some think the pursuit of vengeance destroys one’s soul, others think it is an honorable cause to seek to right a wrong. Wherever the truth lies, revenge is as powerful a motivator as love or pride or honor, and those who seek vengeance will often stop at nothing to achieve it. If necessary, they would move mountains, or destroy kingdoms to get justice.\n\nIn this case, it was a city.\n\nThe Banshees flooded into Wexkeep, cries of battle piercing the air as they fought through the streets. This was it – the moment of vengeance for all their country had suffered during the Lilac Wars. Not just Istralore, even – they were taking revenge for Dameria, for Adenn, for the true Empire that had fallen to the hands of traitors and usurpers over a generation ago. Their fury blazed as hot as the fires they lit along their path.\n\nStores were looted, noble assets were seized, fields burned and property destroyed. Every crime Wex had committed over the past century was repaid here tenfold, as the Banshees ran rampant through the city. By dinner, the castle was occupied. Inside the keep, the Banshees celebrated, looking for choice jewels among the castle’s valuables and drinking wine over the corpses of their enemies. Outside, the air was still, the only sound being the crackling of the fire as the city burned."
istralore.12.a: "When the moon rose on Bal Hyl, its victory was complete."
istralore.13.t: "Banshee Expansion I"
istralore.13.d: "The camp was abuzz with activity as hundreds of newly recruited women prepared for their first training lesson as Banshees. Nesta watched with pride as the new recruits filed in, eager and ready to prepare for the hell they’d be about to be put through. It would be hard – many of these girls had been homemakers – but at the end of this, their strength would come as a surprise even to them. Nesta’s friend, Gwyn, had been chosen to be the instructor for this lot, which was why she was watching with so much pride. Nesta thought back to when she had joined, when she was like one of the girls she now watched.\n\nIt was yesterday and an eternity ago. Sure, she had to follow orders, and sure military life was hard, but it was rewarding. Nesta could be herself; she felt a freedom she had never felt before, regardless of the fact she had a commanding officer. Now that the Istralari Parliament had given them more funding, the Banshees had opened recruitment centers across Istralore. More than ever, girls could apply for the elite regiment in the hope of becoming Nesta’s battle-sister. Even with the centers opening, the elite regiment was flooded with applications, so much that some of the most senior warriors like Nesta and her friends had been temporarily asked to help with training and getting the new recruits situated. With the Banshees exploding in number like this, Nesta feared for their enemies."
istralore.13.a: "After all, a sword is a girl’s best friend."
istralore.14.t: "Banshee Expansion II"
istralore.14.d: "The inaugural class of the newly opened Istralari Banshee Academy sat in their seats and buzzed with great anticipation. These were women who had grown up with the Banshees’ success, themselves growing as the Banshees had, and now they were formally enrolled in the training program. For many, it was a dream come true, made even better by the promise of a guest speaker to welcome the inaugural class: General Nesta Acheron, leader of the Istralari Banshees herself, was to conduct the opening ceremony. Many of the girls present were beyond excited at a chance to see one of the nation’s greatest heroes.\n\nAs Nesta took the stage, she looked at the gathered soon-to-be students. Demand had been vast, and the forum was packed with young women who looked upon her with idolizing eyes. She had never been good at public speaking, and the thought of looking like a fool in front of so many people frightened her a bit, but she believed in their future and in the future of this newly funded academy.\n\n“Welcome, all, to the first step in the road to becoming an Istralari Banshee. The Banshees pride ourselves on being elite, but also welcoming. We believe all of you have the potential to join our ranks, that any woman can summon the fight to become an elite warrior. Inside us all, there is a warrior queen, just waiting to be unleashed. We have no shortage of role models, from Istralania Warsinger to even Corin herself when she walked this earth. It is our sole mission to honor their legacy. Study hard, help each other, and find your inner fire, and someday I will run into battle beside you as a Battle-Sister. I hope to see you on the field.”"
istralore.14.a: "In that moment, the forum was filled with a legion of warriors."

istralore.16.t: "Justice For All - Law"
istralore.16.d: "In recent years, the Warsinger movement has gained significant clout among our people. Taking their name from our founder, Istralania Warsinger, they believe that all citizens are equal and are entitled to equal rights and protections under the law.\n\nThanks to the policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Warsingers are celebrating a victory in the streets. A woman who had been the victim of a heinous crime has found justice, and the perpetrator punished. In few other countries would this have happened but Istralore."
istralore.16.a: "Let the Warsingers revel as they will."
istralore.16.b: "Remind them that this is only possible thanks to the Crown."

istralore.17.t: "Justice For All - Wealth"
istralore.17.d: "In recent years, the Warsinger movement has gained significant clout among our people. Taking their name from our founder, Istralania Warsinger, they believe that all citizens are equal, and are entitled to equal rights and protections under the law.\n\nThanks to the policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName], many business owners have started paying their female workers equal wages. This has had a positive effect on the economy, businesses are booming thanks to the increased spending of the workers."
istralore.17.a: "The Crown deserves a cut!"
istralore.17.b: "Our people deserve to keep their money."

istralore.18.t: "Justice For All - Labour"
istralore.18.d: "In recent years, the Warsinger movement has gained significant clout among our people. Taking their name from our founder, Istralania Warsinger, they believe that all citizens are equal, and are entitled to equal rights and protections under the law.\n\nRecently, we have found a growing flexibility within our labor pool as a result. With more families moving around our lands to find work, and more businesses popping up started by women, we are left with an opportunity to guide our labor pool. Should the Crown choose, incentives can be made to direct our labor where they are most needed. Our military could always use more bodies, but farming is the lifeblood of our ever growing nation. Where should we direct our workers?"
istralore.18.a: "Put a sword in their hand, let them fight for Istralore!"
istralore.18.b: "There’s just as much pride to be found with a plough."

istralore.20.t: "Warsong Graduate"
istralore.20.d: "The Warsong College trains some of the most elite military minds in the world. Many of the alumni of the College have met glory, fame, or both. This year, one woman has graduated with perfect marks, a true prodigy of her field. It would be a shame to not make use of her."
istralore.20.a: "A cabinet position awaits such a promising woman!"
istralore.20.b: "Send her to be a drill instructor, she can whip our armies into shape."
istralore.20.c: "Her place is on the field! Grant her generalship!"

istralore.21.t: "The Rose Wilts"
istralore.21.d: "Victory. Victory is a taste so sweet, and it tastes all the better when the struggle is long and hard.\n\nAt long last, we now have our revenge upon our old enemy. Lorent, the puppetmaster behind the fall of Dameria, has fallen to their knees. Even now, the Banshees rush into Lorentaine as they did to Wexkeep, showing the Lorentish the extent of our rage and fury. However, this won’t be enough to right the wrongs caused by Lorent. We will strip the cities bare, take all the ill gotten loot from the land, as restitution for the Lilac Wars. We will not stop until we have pruned the rose, removed all its thorns, so that it may never prick anyone with its poison again."
istralore.21.a: "And so the mighty Rose wilted in the light of the Moon."

istralore.22.t: "Under Cold Moonlight"
istralore.22.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked around the evening dinner party in the royal gardens. Many of the faithful electors had gathered to attend the victory feast held to celebrate the Empire’s complete victory over Lorent. The moonlit feast was filled with mirth and celebration;Istralore had fought for this victory for many years.\n\n“My friends,” the Emperor began, “today we celebrate a historic victory. The road taken has been long and full of trials, but now our victory is complete. The lands of Lorent have yielded to our rule, her people have rejected their corrupt overlords and accepted the righteous and just rule of the Empire, and now we sit, our enemies crushed, as the greatest nation in the world! The Rose will never again rise to the heights it once held, and all of us here can claim a part of that victory. Together, we have righted history. Together, we have crushed our enemies. Now together, we march forward to a new era, one where no power in Cannor can resist our might! For Anbennar! For Corin! For Victory!”\n\nThe cheers of those gathered at the feast were loud and eager:"
istralore.22.a: "For Anbennar! For Corin! For Victory!"

istralore.23.t: "Prosperous People"
istralore.23.d: "In recent years, our nation has experienced new levels of prosperity. Nowhere else in the Empire, or perhaps all of Halaan, can match our riches. In fields of academics, economics, diplomacy, and administration we are always reaching new heights.\n\nThis is in no small part due to our egalitarianism, by which we enable bright minds in all fields to shine brightly and add competitiveness to their field. One such bright mind has come to the attention of the Crown, and is now ready to serve their country."
istralore.23.a: "We could always use more experts."

istralore.24.t: "The Sealion Proclaimation"
istralore.24.d: "At long last, the will of Corin is known throughout the Empire. A great victory, to be sure, but there is more work to be done. A darkness looms in distant Sarhal, a threat to our brethren in faith. The gnolls of Akasik must be tamed, their threat removed. We must bring Corin’s Light to Sarhal, by righteous crusade.\n\nWe will need ships to carry our troops, to cross the sea and land in northern Sarhal, and so we must prepare a fleet unlike any we have built before. This Sealion Proclamation will be the first step of our Crusade. When our ships land in Sarhal, they will show the Gnolls Corin’s might."
istralore.24.a: "It is our holy duty to spread Corin to Sarhal! Prepare the ships!"

istralore.25.t: "Victory on Halann"
istralore.25.d: "After years of war and devastation, Corin’s Truth is finally known among the Empire. From Verne to Damescrown to Beepeck, all recognise that Corinism is the true faith. Heretic princes have been rightly removed from power, and the Emperor rules from a seat ordained by Corin herself. There are still some who resist the truth, but they are becoming less and less numerous.\n\nLong have we seen ourselves as Corin’s champions, those whose duty it was to spread her glory throughout the Empire. Now, after a hard fought war with our brothers in faith, we have won. With strength of arms and unwavering loyalty to our faith, we have claimed victory in the present, and now we must look toward the future.\n\nThe future of a Corinite Anbennar, an Empire of Unity, where men and women of all races are equal and true under Corin’s Light. The first steps have been taken, the path is set, now we must make it so. As Corin’s champions, we will succeed."
istralore.25.a: "One day, paradise will be upon Halaan, as in heaven. "

istralore.26.t: "Corinite Dominance"
istralore.26.d: "The Emperor had demanded our conversion to the true faith, and we have no recourse but to oblige."
istralore.26.a: "My life for Corin!"

istralore.27.t: "Unity"
istralore.27.d: "A grand parade marched through the empire. Starting in Istralore and continuing all the way to the Dove Throne in Anbencost, a combined military column of soldiers from every imperial prince marched in a grand procession to swear fealty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. All the while, civilians cheered them on as they marked a momentous time in the Empire’s history. \n\nIn Anbenncost, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] awaited, greeting each company from the procession and accepting their fealty. This was, of course, purely symbolic. The real agreement had been reached behind closed doors some time ago, but such a massive decision deserved an equally massive gesture. The Empire was to be consolidated, the Princes were to become direct vassals of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], swearing fealty and loyalty to Istralore.\n\nIt was the natural conclusion, of course. Istralore had led the charge with Corin, achieved justice for Dameria, and succeeded their former overlords in every way. Istralore had fostered a spirit of togethership and camaraderie, and since assuming the Emperorship, had since become synonymous with the term “[Root.Monarch.GetTitle].” Only the delegates of each prince truly know what caused them to agree to give up their autonomy, but regardless of the reason, the outcome was the same.\n\nFor the first time in centuries, the nations of the Empire joined together under one commanding banner. For the first time in centuries, Anbennar lived up to its name:"
istralore.27.a: "Unity."

istralore.30.t: "Together"
istralore.30.d: "Anbennar is a place of many peoples, many talents, and many skills. After disaster struck, we bonded together with our allies, reinforcing the bonds that had been forged during war. Now, after many years, those bonds are near unbreakable.\n\nThe sailors of Moonhaven drink and share stories in Yshwood.\n\nThe builders of Silverforge barter and trade their iron and minerals in the markets of Istralore.\n\nThe wyvern riders of Verne soar through the skies, drilling with our armies.\n\nIstralore is a nation of Dwarves, Elves, Humans, and Half-Elves, all working together as one disciplined unit. After years of assisting our allies, the time has now come to take a step further. The leaders of Verne, Moonhaven, and Silverforge have met with [Root.Monarch.GetName] and after much deliberation and convincing, have decided to join our family formally. Each now swears fealty to Istralore, not just Anbennar – allies no longer, but true brothers to be honored and protected as one of our own."
istralore.30.a: "Together, we will find victory."

istralore.31.t: "Daughters of Istralore"
istralore.31.d: "The streets quickly filled as the Istralari Banshees passed through the countryside. They were on their way back from war, marching to the capital to receive praise from the Duchess herself. For little Sybille, who had just turned ten and therefore no longer wished to be called a child, this was a dream come true. She had climbed up onto the roof of her home, hoping to watch the heroes passing through her little town.\n\nHer dad had told her not to climb, that it wasn’t becoming of a lady, but her mom just said that it was the mark of the Banshee. Or one of them, anyway. Sybille’s mother was a die-hardWarsinger, one of those who praised the Banshees as national heroes and framed them as the forefront of the Istralari military.\n\nThe young girl eagerly watched as the elite all-women fighting force passed by her home. They were so big! Each woman down below was dressed as a soldier, albeit in dress uniform for this march through civilian lands. Even unarmored, they stood and walked like powerful warriors, larger than life to the eager young girl.\n\nThe woman at the head of the column turned back and glanced right at Sybille. She smiled and waved a hand at her before returning to her march. Sybille gasped and immediately got up. She climbed down the side of her house to rush inside and tell her parents about her hero waving to her. Incidents like this have become common throughout Istralore. As the Istralari Banshees’ prowess becomes more well known, the same phrase can be heard from girls of all ages:"
istralore.31.a: "“I wanna be just like them when I grow up.”"

istralore.38.t: "Empress Aucanna"
istralore.38.d: "Aucanna found the Dove Throne cold. Gleaming gold and sublime silver linings glistened in the light, yet there was no warmth in it. Even all the plush velvet and plump cushions, added by Emperors prior, could not bring comfort to her as she fought the urge to fidget.\n\nBanners of Damerian Blue hung throughout the hall, alongside the Sealion of her own flag. All assembled beneath them beamed, for this was a day of celebration. Tellumite criers in the streets called out her name and the people cheered in reply.\n\nJoyous. That was what today was supposed to be.\n\nTrumpets sounded as the great double doors of the imperial court swung open and the electoral procession entered. The electors trooped in, clad in their formal robes of office, taking their places amongst those assembled in the hall. Aucanna could see her friends amongst them, and her enemies also. All wore smiles, though strangely her foes' faces seemed more akin to hers than her allies, with lips curled upwards but no glint in their eyes.\n\nThe crown approached her now, and she bowed her head to receive it. The band that was placed upon her head was thin and golden, yet the weight that fell upon her was unlike any she had ever known. It was all she could do to keep her back straight as she sat up.\n\n“Hail, Aucanna Silistra. Hail, Empress of Anbennar.” The assembled voices rang out as one - great and small, eager and reticent, all said her name.\n\nAucanna could only think one thing."
istralore.38.a: "It should’ve been him."

istralore.39.t: "The Beginning of the End"
istralore.39.d: "A wound could not stop Aucanna Silistra. If death did not halt Corin's war, she could fight past a scrape. Or a stab. Or a broken kneecap. She had done all of that and more when making a mockery of the Traitor's tournament, and she would do it again.\n\nAn illness could not stop Aucanna Silistra. Not when Anbennar was so deeply ill, with treachery and disloyalty. If she could not ride a horse, she could still write a letter; if she could not write a letter, she could still bark commands to assembled advisors. And she would, because that was her duty.\n\nChildbirth could not stop Aucanna Silistra. She reviewed the troops the day before she bore Aucan III, and she reviewed them the day afterwards. She spent the days her labour took for Marian drawing up a new defensive plan for the Dalemines, and duelled a novice bladedancer from Ibevar to a draw not one week after Alain was born. Losing the Lilac Wars and Dameria, that was something it would take years to recover -- childbirth would not.\n\nThrough all of this, she hadn’t faltered. Not until yesterday, at least.. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that even Corin leaned on allies.And [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows it is time for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother to sheathe her sword -- though not her intellect. And to start to cede the rule of [Root.GetName]. And Aucanna?"
istralore.39.a: "Admitting it will be the hardest task she's faced in years."

istralore.40.t: "Struggling On"
istralore.40.d: "Aucanna had devoted her life to Istralore. Not just [Root.Capital.GetName], but the entire [Root.GovernmentName]. Reviewing the border guards. Tracing the flow of potential attacks, from or against her realm. Visiting returning adventurers from Escann to hear their stories of Corin. And countless other tasks, great and small, that took her from the castle in [Root.Capital.GetName] time and time again, to the point [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was half-raised by her letters. But she will ride out no longer. Aucanna taught the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that there is a tone a doctor uses, when they should be ignored in favour of duty. And there is a tone they use, when the alternative is death. The words the doctor delivered today were soft, but undeniably the latter. Her latest bout of illness had passed, but could – would – relapse soon. And without specialized care, she would soon be dead. Aucanna furrowed her brow to hear it, but nodded. Two hours later, she was on the training fields. She is still reviewing the troops, still sparring with Warsingers, still discussing planning with generals. After all, she learned at twenty what it is like to lose."
istralore.40.a: "And what it means to fight on."

istralore.41.t: "New Moon"
istralore.41.d: "Aucanna was so weak now. The Physicians had told [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that she wouldn’t last much longer. The latest bout of illness had struck her hard, bringing her to her knees out on the parapets overlooking the training field. She’d wanted to go down of course, but her legs hadn’t allowed it even then.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled down at her, a thin smile, one [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] had seen on her face many times. An insincere smile. It wouldn’t be long.\n\n“Don’t look at me like that” Aucanna rasped.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] saw the pain she hid in her eyes as - with great effort - she shifted her neck to look at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. They said nothing.\n\n“I’m dying. I can feel it. This will be my deathbed.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] took her hand, biting down on their tongue. There were so many words they could say, so many they wanted to - but Aucanna would never forgive them if they showed weakness, here at the end.\n\n“You have much work left to do, little one. I only hope, by Corin’s grace, that I have made the road easier for you. Hold your friends close, and never forget-” Aucanna spluttered, coughing.\n\n“Never forget what?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked gently, fighting with all the strength they had to keep their tone soft and level.\n\n“Never forget what I taught you.” Aucanna whispered, the lustre fading from her eyes.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] squeezed her hand as the life left it, and the light in her eyes went dim."
istralore.41.a: "“I won’t m- Duchess.”"
