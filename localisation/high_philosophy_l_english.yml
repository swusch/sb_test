However now that we have joined their ranks of philosophers, it's clear that, among their ways of thought, they are also quite divided as to what certain key reliefs and friezes mean that have been found in the High Temples.

Once the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would have gone years between visits, but ever since the scholar from the Ascendant Soul school arrived in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court this had become a regular journey. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] disembarked and entered the temple complex. Its central tower rose high into the sky, and it was surrounded by sturdy walls which sheltered various smaller structures.\n\nThe scholar interrupted the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s marveling and bid them welcome. They brought [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the entrance of what appeared to be a small stone cellar. Inside, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was met with a large pit constructed like an old stepwell. The scholar lit a lantern and began to descend the stairs while beckoning [Root.Monarch.GetName] to follow. As they proceeded, the scholar spoke.\n\n"We have already spoken at length about the necessity of improving all aspects of yourself: the physical, mental, magical, and of course spiritual… but I fear you have not fully taken to heart the need to master power and have the wisdom to use it well. True you may command $COUNTRY$, but you do not yet control yourself. To truly achieve Purtara you must have the power to shape the world and the wisdom of the High Gods."\n\nFinally the scholar reached the bottom, and moved the lantern to illuminate the southern wall. A carving took up the entirety of the wall, and depicted a scene of massive construction. Mountains were leveled, and the temple itself built from the remains of the former. All of this done by the High God Pathim with seemingly little effort, and massive fanfare of those below her. The scholar spoke once more.\n\n"Let us now sit in this old holy place, and meditate on this wisdom I speak of.""

As if on cue, the moment the light reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s face, a knock came upon the door, and the scholar cracked it open while facing away from the room.\n\nHe apologized, "Ah, I did not realize you were still asleep. However, it is the mathematically perfect time for another of my lessons."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] groaned, but gathered themself and donned a robe before bidding the scholar entrance. He walked into the room and motioned towards the silk curtains at the eastern end which separated the bedroom from the outdoor space. Moving the curtains aside, both walked out onto the circular balcony and looked upon $CAPITAL_CITY$.\n\nThe scholar began to lecture, "Below you are the people of your city. They move in accordance with their place, do they not? The bread maker brings his goods to the markets just as they open. The fires of the forge lit by the blacksmith as the sun first touches his brow. Even the traders move to and fro with the clockwork of the world. All in their place. All at their greatest potential. Even the city itself reflects the precise geometry of the High Temples through the route of its streets, and the angles of its structures."\n\nThe scholar paused. "It is this that the temples speak most highly of: Order. To perpetuate it is the purest form of Kartya." There was a longer pause as the two of them watched the city in motion. Finally, the scholar asked, "What do you believe your place is in the mechanism of the world?""

This often meant that [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat through petty squabbles over land markers, or who owned a particular goat. Today was not all that different. The next in line was a man of the lower caste, his hands covered in calluses, and his clothes barely held together. He knelt before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and began to speak with trembling in his voice,\n\n"[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], I do not ask much of my superiors, but today I must beg for yours. My eldest boy is ill, but I cannot afford his medicine. I am only a simple farmer, and my wife has long since parted this world. Please, can you find it in your heart to help me?"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] considered waving the man aside, but decided against it. Maybe the Orange Sash school scholar really was having an impact upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] remembered the scholar speaking almost daily on the importance of familial harmony; on the significance of mirroring the High Gods and following your place in the family structure. Elders must provide for their offspring, who in turn should be obedient to their parents and grand-parents. Only once a family has achieved internal harmony can they begin to connect with other families in external harmony, and achieve Purtara.\n\nA tap on the shoulder brought [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reverie.

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] eyes roamed across the golden lettering upon the page and darted from one exquisite marginalia to another. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] finished reading and, perplexed, requested an escort to the public bath house.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] recollected the events of the past couple months. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had invited a Silk Turban school scholar to $COUNTRY$ and given them free reign to roam the streets. Within weeks this decision seemed to achieve its ends exquisitely. The markets were full with previously unseen goods brought in by merchants from afar (who of course were obliged to pay a tax on imports). The newfound revenue quickly solved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s problems, and soon they turned their attention to other issues. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] thought that would be the end of the matter, but as they rounded the corner to the bath house, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] realized there was more to this scholar than a desire for wealth.\n\nThe baths were normally a quiet place, but today a swarm of workers enveloped the site. Masons worked to remove sections of old mud brick walls and replaced them with freshly cut granite. Artisans worked to refurbish frescos and tile mosaics, while drapers brought in smooth silk curtains and hung them in the windows. A smith placed gemstones and fine metals within the floor, while another man brought in golden hanging candelabras to place into new ceiling fixtures. The scholar emerged from the commotion with a merchant beside him and quickly approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The scholar spoke,\n\n"I see you received my companion’s missive. Good! Soon the baths of $CAPITAL_CITY$ will be the most magnificent emulation of the golden temple’s aesthetics! This man has embraced my teachings full heartedly and donated a significant portion of the funds for this project himself! It would seem your subjects are finally beginning to understand the importance of utilizing their wealth to enrich and uplift their community."\n\nThe scholar smiled, "Purtara may finally be within their grasp."\n\nWith jubilation, the merchant and the scholar departed. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood in shock. The scholar’s teachings truly seemed to be taking hold. What would this mean? This very well might… A page ran up beside the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and produced a letter with a golden seal. [Root.Monarch.GetName] began to read,"

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] faced the western window, in line with the others, and unfurled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rug. For a few moments silence washed over [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Then the Radiant Sun scholar began to lead the temple in ritual penance.\n\n"Unfortunately the sun does not grace us with its presence this afternoon. Yet let us not be lost in the darkness, but instead pay reverence to Digatha so she may lead us out of the storm. For while the rains fall about us, and thunder rolls in the distance, each of us is lost in our own storm - one of our own making."\n\nThe scholar continued as the thunder grew ever closer to the city.\n\n"We have all strayed from our Nitikamarja. The nature of daily life ensures this. Yet, we can, as always, return to it once again. As the High Gods once worshiped, so shall we. Their ceremonies are our ceremonies, and through our faith and fervor we will be set upon the true path to Purtara. May the High Gods’ guidance touch all of you."\n\nLightning came down in the distance as he exclaimed, "With the proclamation complete, it is time to do as the High Gods did once before. Present your offering to the flame, and cleanse yourself through its destruction."\n\nOne by one people walked to the altar and brought objects to be devoured by the flaming basin. An elderly woman brought forth a fragment of pottery, and her husband brought a hammer. Each person here presented something to be absolved of, a mistaken deviation from their Nitikamarja that they wished to correct. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the last to make an offering and presented a spear tip, taken from a soldier who fell in battle against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] army. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] placed it in the flame a great bolt of lightning crashed to the ground a few meters from the temple grounds. The scholar grinned like a child and spoke once more,\n\n"The High Gods seem to be quite pleased with your offering.""

All echelons of the court were present, from servants to administrators, and some of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own family. Once [Root.Monarch.GetName] was sat within the circle, scholar Aahan produced a number of silk wrappings from his cloak and began to distribute them. The scholar then entered the center of the ring and spoke,\n\n"We have come far in our lessons. We have observed the celestial bodies, and I have shared knowledge of their hidden truths. We partook in herbal teas and debated our collective truths under the lamp-light. Yet those are only two of the three paths you must tread... I will now light the incense. I ask you to look upon it, fall into its swirling form, and when ready, don your blindfold." Then there was a pause. "Let us begin."\n\nAfter the Starry Eye Scholar arrived, caste agnostic events like this sprang up throughout [Root.Country.GetName]. Cities that had previously seen few devotees became hotspots overnight as the scholar taught new pupils of the hidden signs within celestial bodies and emphasized the three-fold path to enlightenment. He encouraged debate, discussion, and meditation, such that all could find the inner, group, and outer knowledge that are the core of the three-fold path.\n\nAs the last candles began to sputter, the incense cones finally died out. One by one people removed their blindfolds - having finished their meditation - and waited for all to look upon the dim wicks. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes the scholar moved about the ring and asked everyone to share what they had learned over the past week. A page spoke fondly of the first lesson and a newfound understanding of the stars and their meanings. A diplomat enthusiastically described her experience partaking in debate and collective growth during the second lesson. Then a blacksmith remarked on the newfound self realization they have discovered in this third lesson. Other spoke of various truths, until finally, the scholar turned to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and asked,\n\n"What is it that you have learned?""

One must strive to be strict yet generous with their clients, hawkishly protect their charges, and subsume their enemies. This is the Kartya most truthfully espoused by the High Gods and their temples." - Sarika Mrudaya of the Unbroken Claw School\n\nThe scholar from the Unbroken Claw school read that passage inside [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s chambers, but it had resonated through the halls of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] home ever since. The reverberations passed into the countryside, to the petty lords and the army officers. Provincial governors cracked down on detractors and recruited local power holders into their patron-client relations. Mayors encouraged normal drilling of local militias, and the cities and towns under this new stricter rule prospered.\n\nToday a group of generals and lower ranking officers came before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].

One irate general shouted that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] wished to prevent them from achieving Nitikamarja.

Historically, adherents would view artwork from far away temples throughout Haless by relying on codices filled with painted replications. These codices, called Brahmkalaas, have often been the only way middle and lower caste individuals could view the artwork of the High Temples for themselves. While originally quite laborious to produce, the advent of woodblock printing in the 800’s AA dramatically decreased the labor requirements for their production, and the creation of Brahmkalaas has been a significant business ever since, with nearly every school and upper caste home possessing a copy.\n\n Where the block press innovated copying the murals of the High Temples, the moveable type printing press has innovated copying of the written word. This in turn has led to a proliferation of essays and interpretations concerning the art within the Brahmkalaas, and it is becoming more and more common for lower and middle caste individuals to own a copy of essays regarding the various murals and frescoes of the High Temples. While this is a strict positive for those who could never afford a Brahmkalaa, many philosophers are concerned with the fact that a large number of people are no longer interpreting the artworks themselves, but trusting someone else's written account. Furthermore, fewer and fewer people are buying the old woodblock printed Brahmkalaas, and the industry as a whole is beginning to struggle.\n\nArtists and Philosophers from nearby High Temples have come to the court of [Root.Country.GetName], asking assistance with their declining industry and to clamp down on the proliferation of these new essays and the presses that enable their circulation.

 high_philosophy_events.20.d:0 "The strife of the past centuries have unfortunately blocked access to one of the greatest wonders of the High Philosophy tradition - The Godswall. While most can no longer get there safely, there are, luckily for them, innumerable hand painted replicas within several different Brahmkalaas. The massive structure spans the gap between Maruvad and the Ascension Plateau, and contains innumerable examples of architecture from the High Gods and ancient human civilizations. It is widely understood that the bulk of this work was done by the High God of Artists, Pathim, thanks to a set of three carved slabs resting at the bottom right hand side of the monument.\n\nThe first granite slab shows the cliffside as it once was - a beautiful wooden landscape defined by sheer rocky outcroppings. In the second, Pathim is shown at several different locations carving away stone and clearing foliage - working upon the cliff face as though it was a block of marble. Finally, the third carving shows The Godswall when Pathim finished the project. Statues carved from the earth line the cliffside as steep steps twist and turn between their forms. Below the image of the structure, seemingly within the earth itself, lies the High God herself in a meditative stance surrounded by lotus flowers. Interestingly, through a quick comparison, one can see that much has been added to the structure since the High God finished her project: new temples and footpaths dot the landscape, lotus gardens now adorn the various terraces, and statues in several different styles grace the cliff’s peak.\n\nTo meditate on The Godswall is a truly impossible task, and many have devoted their life to the attempt. However, the construction of the monument is a different, much more tractable, matter to ponder. What does [Root.Monarch.GetName] make of Pathim’s masterpiece?"

 high_philosophy_events.21.d:0 "Rain clinks onto clay roofing tiles. [Root.Monarch.GetName] peers out of the brick shelter and watches as the dirt road slowly becomes potted with puddles. A guard follows [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s sight towards the water and dejectedly raises his voice, “It’s as if Liilaamora herself sheds tears today…” A perfectly normal idiom, but today, trapped in this roadside shelter, [Root.Monarch.GetName] chooses to meditate on it.\n\nThe Tragedy of Liilaamora is a well known tale; laid out across a series of small ceramic cylinders deep within the High Temple of Sarilavhan. The tale begins as the High God Jaghut approaches a village where he distributes the contents of a small food basket. The people, shorter relative to Jaghut, hesitantly partake, with one exception - Liilaamora. She stands defiantly, gazing daggers into the High God.\n\nIn a scene which has since been carved away with a crude knife and melted in several places, Jaghut seems to get on his knees. The two then speak across several images, with each, Liilaamora’s expression softens, and grows warm. Eventually they leave, walking down a path of lotus flowers. They mark their journey with floral garlands as they walk in peace. They eventually reach the High God Dipar, who shouts down to the pair. The two stand defiant in a manner normally not fitting the quiet Jaghut, yet Dipar does not budge and points away from the path.\n\nLiilaamora grows weaker and weaker as they approach a small grove of trees, until finally, upon a bed of lotus flowers, she is put to rest. Jaghut weeps with her in unison; their tears forming two rivers which snake through the valleys of Shamakhad. Hidden within the final carving, resting gently upon Liilaamora’s chest, is a small silver rod."

Within the upper levels of the partially sunken High Temple of Lake Tamakhan, his visage can be seen in association with Nermali and Dipar. However, buried away within the dark water logged chambers is a small room with the tell-tale signs of Gunjit’s craft. Our only account of the chamber comes to us from a small band of adventurers, who, fortunately for us, recorded the room's layout and made a transfer of its central images.\n\nAccording to the account: “...At first, the room was bathed in darkness - only a small blue orb could be seen through the musty air. Upon touching the orb, the darkness throughout the room was pulled towards it. Wisps of soot and ash whipped past us wailing like the dead. Then all was silent, and the glowing blue glass orb hummed at a low frequency. With the darkness dispersed, the scene was revealed to us. The orb sat upon a white marble podium surrounded by 4 images of the High God Gunjit, which depicted him at various steps in the process of making both. Above the orb was a mural of stars connected like constellations, and spread out across most of the ceiling. However, there was nothing else in the chamber, and the narrowness of the previous passage prevented us from bringing the orb back.”\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] finishes reading the account, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes glance out onto the nearby lake.

Ancient clay tablets and papyrus scrolls line the granite walls, small lanterns lit by magic illuminate the scripts and associated reading areas, and prominently featured at the back of the building is the mosaic commonly referred to as “Simral's Folly”.\n\nBuilt of hand painted glass tesserae, the mosaic depicts Simral floating among the clouds on a sunny day as flecks of gold and silver meet his crossed legs. From his sky perch he sketches the progression of the left hand scene. There, within the jungle below, an army of black dots, barely perceptible, move blocks to a massive foundation where a half finished tower built of white stone blocks rises into the sky. More importantly though, Simral seems to be startled by whatever used to be on the right hand side of the mosaic. Upon that spot lies large gashes and innumerable missing tiles that have rendered whatever used to be there indecipherable. Debate upon what used to be there runs rampant, but whatever it was is long since lost to history.\n\nLooking upon the replicated mural and associated library, [Root.Monarch.GetName] considers the meaning of the artworks."

The creature digs through the leaves and detritus around the roots of an oak tree, but despite his efforts he comes up empty handed. He looks up and watches a great ashen darkness cloak the heavens. Embers fall about him until finally, with no prize in hand he is forced to flee.\n\nThe High God Vadham arrives some time later. The oak tree is reduced to a smoldering husk, and the land around him is in ruin. Yet, the squirrel survived the disaster and approaches Vadham, to which he replies by placing a bag upon the ground. The next tiles depicts the veritable feast which spills forth - seeds of all different kinds and varieties, most still protected inside their shells. The squirrel, of course, takes as many seeds as it can and flees into the surrounding countryside. At this, Vadham smiles and leaves.\n\nThe final image is stretched out below and across all the others, depicts a new forest. It is covered in fresh growth and abundant wildlife. In the middle of the scene, Vadham sits on the stump of the burned oak as he looks over a small vegetable garden, and seems at peace.

They have chosen to, on the advice of a philosopher, spend this time in meditation. Procuring a Brahmkalaas from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] private collection, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits down in the morning light and turns to a collection of painted replicas from the Godswall.\n\nThe set of replicated images depict the High God Anjita’s journey to save his daughter-son Tikhaaphula after they are captured by the black dragon Hakataamadiihai (which is another tale unto itself). After a number of trials and tribulations in the surrounding hillside, his quest leads him into the depths of a great mountain. Entering into a cave, the land begins to slope into the soupy darkness. As Anjita’s chariot rushes forward, the High God battles what seems to be the shadows themselves, and is only able to prevail with the aid of a blue torch. After escaping the shades, he reaches the bottom and enters into the lair of the beast. A great battle erupts between the two as Anjita charges his chariot into clouds of green smoke that smothers all life they touch. The conflict stretches out over three paintings, ending only when Anjita, after patiently waiting for an opening, pierces the dragon’s belly with a spear of pure light fashioned by the High God Gunjit.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] finishes looking through the painted replicas, and then, sipping from a cup of tea, ponders the story’s meaning in relation to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] current conflict."

Waves lap languidly upon the side of the vessel, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] sighs. This will be the third day at sea - with no prospect of forward motion. [Root.Monarch.GetName] collapses down into a bench, feels the briney air brush against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face, and remembers a story.\n\nAccording to the High Temple of Keoaden, Daiia, a child of the High God Dipar, one day journeyed with the High God Digatha. Their destination - a land of white sands and prismatic waters. On each day, the winds would push them away from their quarry. Digatha would patiently sit upon the deck and watch the waves, yet Daiia would attempt to wrestle the craft back onto its course. On the first day she tried with sails, then on the second with oars, and at last on the third with both simultaneously. For these three days Digatha watched, until on the fourth day she stood and moved to Daiia’s side. Digatha placed a hand upon the oar, and bade Daiia to come sit. The words spoken are not written. A panel depicts the two sitting, watching the waves. A second panel shows Digatha procuring a fishing net. Then the third, fourth, and fifth panels depicted them as they waited - the winds and waves continued their churning. Yet, finally, upon the sixth day the skies cleared, the craft reached the ever changing sea and became beached upon her white shores. Safely upon those sands, it is said that Daiia asked Digatha “Why did you not stop the winds?” To which Digatha replied “I did, but for those who were not us - for those who needed true aid, when all we needed was patience.” However, everyone knows that is simply what we tell the children, for in the final image Digatha and Daiia merely sit there on the beach and cry.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is shaken awake by the splash of salty water upon their face as the wind begins to gain strength, and considers the meaning of the tale."

In this time of loss, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] meditates on the dichotomy of life and death.\n\nIn the High Temple of Lanjincun, a series of steles within the inner temple wall depict Nermali, the High God of healers, tending to a variety of different diseases. Sometimes she is shown to cure the sick with a wave of her hand, on other occasions one of the snakes upon her necklace descends to the dying and sucks fluids from their veins, and in many more she kneels by the bedside of the dying and administers a salve or potion. Most of these diseases and afflictions are known commonly to the peoples of Haless, as are some of her cures - yet there is one stele, perched upon a stone coffin lined with silver metal that depicts something different.\n\nThe upper quartile is lined with images depicting Nermali attempting several different curing methods to no avail, until finally, in a large image taking up the rest of the stele, she seems to pray. Her stoppered flasks lie broken upon the ground, her hand only faintly glowing, and her snakes join their master’s hands in defeat raised over a body in seeming exultation.

When night finally descended, a figure jumped from the carriage and handed Vachava a package. She then mounted her horse and traveled across the land. She rode through mountains and valleys, rivers and bogs, until eventually she arrived at her destination: a small cottage nestled in a verdant glade. In this moment Vachava is shown to be her most beautiful - bathed in a morning sun, lines of silver traced her hair, and golden outlines graced her footsteps as she approached the cottage. With the brown package in hand she rattled the knocker and waited.\n\nThe next image is unfortunately lost to history; however, we do possess the carving that follows thereafter. It depicts Vachava face to face with the goddess known as Sudarkha, child of Nermali. She is draped in a blue-green robe stitched with golden threads, and dragonflies graced her form as they fluttered their prismatic wings. Vachava held Sudarkha closely - their arms wrapped around each other’s waists. The package lay at their feet, and was opened to reveal a golden necklace with a blue gemstone poking out of the box.

This is to say, that I hope Suhan will end as simply another rip in the cloth, patched together with the deeds of better men.”\n-Philosopher Vasantbir Ghick\n\nThe sash has been torn down. Tied glass lays shattered upon the ground, and Suhan has crushed the fragments to crystalline dust. An exquisite work of careful hands has been torn to pieces. Stained glass turned to nothing but sand; our art has been destroyed.\n\nThe court is divided, Golden Palace scholars argue with Ascendant Soul scholars with hands on daggers.

Yet those shards, in part fused again, will not simply join the new harmony peacefully. Smoke rises from the ears of scholars and the base of buildings.

Yet the specifics are always a matter of debate. Golden Palace thought holds that it must be maintained through the actions of empires and good rulers, while the Starry Eye school holds that all individuals must maintain it through the growth of your personal Atma. Suhan stands opposed to both of these schools of thought.\n\nSuhan believes that visatma simply is. There is no reason for the individual to concern themselves with its well-being. It will fluctuate with the seasons, the ways of the world, and the acts of man, but in time it will right itself once more.\n\nTo turn back the clock of the reformation is impossible, yet the damage to visatma can be undone; what form does that work take? The kind words of local philosophers, each trying to convert those who they can back to our doctrine? Or is it the strength of the $MONARCHTITLE$ who, through force, will return stability?"

The powers that be often benefit far too much, and will rarely change on their own accord - without a degree of force it will never die. Perhaps, Suhan's Praxis will be that force for change.\n\nOne of the Praxis' core doctrines demands respect for all living peoples; hence men, women, Harimari, Human, slave, and freeman are all equals. To not consider the wisdom of those seen as “lesser” is to ignore half the knowledge of the world. Many of Suhan's followers take this to heart, and lead movements for the progression of women, and sometimes taking violent action against slave owners.\n\nToday such an incident has come to pass. With half a dozen guards and the plantation owner hanged for their perceived crimes; the slaves of the plantation, freed by spear point, now flee into the countryside. The reality is that $COUNTRY$ is still a place where slavery is legal, and whether the $MONARCHTITLE$ likes it or not, the law demands justice.

In particular, Suhan's Praxis dictates that the lavishness of the High Temples; their velvet cushions, golden candles, and luxurious trappings, should be treated with borderline iconoclastic fervor. To them, the addition of mortals to those temples in the form of luxury goods is a despoilment of these holy places — tainted with the temptations of man. Philosophers who follow Suhan's Praxis will often make a point of removing these items and melting them down, or selling them where possible. In practice, they should leave the murals, statues, and artifacts left by the High Gods alone, but this is not always the case.\n\nThe $MONARCHTITLE$ has just received disturbing reports from a group taking this doctrinal principle too far, and in the process of removing luxuries defaced and removed the gems and metals from the wall of a minor High Temple. The local population, in particular members of the Silk Turban school, are outraged and are demanding harsh action. Yet, for some reason, these men have turned themselves in and are begging for forgiveness; a small group of Suhan's Praxis practitioners follow with them, advocating for leniency."

Starry Eye and Golden Palace, Ascendant Soul and Unbroken Claw, Radiant Sun and all others; fundamentally opposed on matters of visatma, svayatma, and emulation respectively.\n\nWhile not all schools are at one another's throats, the bloodshed of today has only served to heighten the tensions supposedly buried in councils long past. Conversation in the Hall of Endless Debate has come to blows, and within our own capital a philosophical disagreement ends with blades - the palace floors stained with blood.

Debates regarding its compartmentalization, distribution, and transmutability led to precursors of the Ascendant Soul and Starry eye splitting from the precursors of the Golden Palace school.Suhan's Praxis stresses the truth found throughout the teachings of all schools of High Philosophy. One way in which it does so is by arguing for a middle path - a mutable nature of atma dependent upon the nature and beliefs of the self. Several local officials following the Golden Palace and Starry Eye schools in $PROVINCE$ see the recent schism as a rehashing of this centuries old problem. For once united against a common enemy, and with righteous fury, they have made calls for violence throughout the province.

Many of our rural subjects are not keen on converting to Suhan's doctrine. The Orange Sash school especially holds a stranglehold over these groups - entrenching them in familial tradition.

The two groups have, for the centuries after Jaher's conquest of Rahen, prayed together in peace. However, in this age of strife, the peace has been broken by the arrival of Suhan's Praxis.\n\nLike the old faiths of the Sarhal Deserts, and the Radiant Dawn school, Suhan's Praxis adherents also pray in the morning. The High Gods are thanked for their work in banishing primordial darkness in the first days of the world, and, most importantly, opening the path towards Purtara for all to walk. While many in Guru Suhan's circle had hoped this common group would bring them together, it has only torn the tapestry further.\n\nToday, a group of Praxis practitioners faced the High Temple for their morning prayer and were met with stones, knives, and inexorable violence - violence that demands an answer."

Several villages and small towns have begun to tear themselves apart as the old and the new grasp for eachother's throats.
