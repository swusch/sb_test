 S15_strengthen_the_hydromancer_guild_title:0 "Strengthen the Hydromancers"
 S15_strengthen_the_hydromancer_guild_desc:0 "In an age long past, during the times of the Anzara Empire, our city was the singular hub for Hydromancers from across all of Taneyas. No other city could claim to have such mastery over the seas as we did.\n\nThe Hydromancers' Guild used to be a pivotal actor within our nation, represented within our court in a manner befitting nobility. Many Hydromancers would find positions as skilled civil engineers or as high-ranking naval officers, bending the seas to our favor, ensuring that not even the roughest of storms could impede our fleets. The millennium of subjugation by Karassk has however left the Hydromancers' Guild in disarray, their operations having been restricted and monitored by the Nagas, while their holdings had been left to fall into disrepair without funding or maintenance.\n\nNow that we are free of Karassk's oppressive rule, we can restore the Hydromancer's Guild to its former glory and ensure their cooperation with our government. For this purpose, we shall reconstruct their holdings and reinstate many of the privileges they once held within our city."

 S15_spread_the_farms_title:0 "Spread the Farms"
 S15_spread_the_farms_desc:0 "While our aquaculture industry has expanded significantly due to government subsidies, there is only so much land in and around Karshyr Island that can be used. This limitation is especially problematic due to the increased interest for seaweed dyes from non-lizardfolk groups such as the Vyzemby halflings. Just when we have the opportunity to make bigger profits than ever before, we are unable to meet demand.\nThankfully, our recent military victories have provided a solution. Whereas our sailors were unable to leave shallow waters under Karassk, both many islands and mainland territories pay tribute to us. Some particularly ambitious seaweed farmers have pooled their resources to expand their operations into these territories, bringing their hard-won aquaculture expertise into the wider world. If we gave official approval to their efforts by formally creating an Aquaculture Guild, we could both increase our production and manipulate prices, thereby ensuring maximum profit."

 S15_reclaim_the_lost_islands_title:0 "Reclaim the Lost Islands"
 S15_reclaim_the_lost_islands_desc:0 "Unlike the Isle of Karshyr, which has been inhabited since time immemorial, many of the other Rankaty Islands have had a far weaker lizardfolk presence, falling out of the control of a centralized state entirely. Many of these islands are either lined with ancient ruins, which we could use to establish our own settlements, or abundant in natural resources that could serve to further develop our cities and fleets.\nConsolidating these islands under our rule would guarantee our dominance over the seas of the western Adzalaz Gulf, ensure that the islands cannot be used against us by our enemies, and facilitate the growth of our economy.\n\nFor the prosperity and safety of our future, Karshyr must become the sole controller of the Rankaty Islands."

 S15_a_natural_ally_title:0 "A Natural Ally"
 S15_a_natural_ally_desc:0 "Our claims on the Rankaty Islands have been realized, with all of the islands now firmly under our direct control. However, while the islands are inhabited by disorganized tribes of our people as we had expected, their surroundings are not: It seems that there are multiple merfolk settlements scattered around the isles.\nDue to the merfolk's ties to the Baashidi, especially their tendency to rely upon the Baashidi to handle interactions with outsiders, the relations between our peoples has previously been rather frigid.\nAs the Baashidi still harbor contempt for our kin, due to Karassk’s oppression of the Baashidi people, they have done little to represent us to the merfolk in an amicable manner.\n\nDespite this, the merfolk have now come to learn that our people are not savage beasts, but rather a civilized people with whom they can interact cordially. We have no intentions of adversely affecting the merfolk's settlements. Their presence could become an opportunity for us, if we cooperate with one another."

 S15_invite_them_to_karshyr_title:0 "Invite Them To Karshyr"
 S15_invite_them_to_karshyr_desc:0 "Since our discovery of the merfolk's presence on the Rankaty Islands, we have been able to arrange for various trade agreements and have effectively become close allies. Our expansion has required an abundance of food, which the merfolk have been able to provide in exchange for our dyes, which they seem to be fond of. We did not expect our interactions with the merfolk to go as well as they have, yet we gladly welcome this pleasant surprise.\n\nAs we have little to fear from the merfolk, there is no reason to not further our alliance with them. We shall invite them to create a settlement on the Isle of Karshyr itself, so that we can accelerate the barter - and demonstrate the goodwill - between our people."

 S15_the_city_of_nazyhn_title:0 "The City of Nazhyn"
 S15_the_city_of_nazyhn_desc:0 "We have learned that Nazhyn, the highly addictive substance produced in Nazhni, is created by processing Nazyhn, a seaweed unique to the waters around Nazhni. Nazhyn could be one of our greatest assets, if we were to encourage the production and trade thereof. Its addictive and irresistible nature would guarantee long-term dependence on our trade in any region in which we choose to sell Nazhyn.\n\nPartaking in such a trade will put the same black mark on our reputation as Nazhni once enjoyed. Other nations remember with distaste the spectre of the Nazhyn addict; yearning for euphoric relaxation, yet suffering from severe insomnia and nausea - sometimes even comatose. Yet the profits may, in the end, be worth it."


 S15_begin_the_restoration_title:0 "Begin the Restoration"
 S15_begin_the_restoration_desc:0 "Once upon a time - over a millennium ago - our city was one of the largest and greatest in all of the Anzara Empire, its architectural and infrastructural design considered a marvel to many of the other cities within the empire. However, that has not been the case for an aeon. The city's grand temples, magnificent citadels and extravagant ports all lie in disrepair, unmaintained and in dire need of restoration.\n\nWith our newfound freedom, we finally have the resources to restore Karshyr to its former glory: roads shall be expanded and repaved, temples renovated, citadels modernized and ports refurbished. Our city shall not wallow in disrepair; instead, it shall thrive once more and become the cultural jewel that it is destined to be.\nKarshyr shall become a city worthy of rule: The Shining Crater-Capital of the lizardfolk."

 S15_adventures_into_aquaculture_title:0 "Aquaculture Experiments"
 S15_adventures_into_aquaculture_desc:0 "Karshyr has always been known for its seaweed dyes, but our methods of production have changed over the centuries. At our height our fishermen scavenged across the ocean for the finest materials, but under Karassk’s rule they were confined to local waters. In desperation, many of them sought to more efficiently extract the bounty of those waters that we did have access to, by purposefully cultivating seaweed. While these projects have never reached their full potential, they helped to maintain a reasonable level of production in those troubled times.\nNow that we no longer have to ship all of our wealth to Karassk, we are free to give our aquaculture the investment it deserves. This includes expanding operations across the island, breeding superior strains of seaweed, and a variety of other measures that will push our production higher than ever before. With these revenues, we can ensure we are never enslaved again."

 S15_export_the_khateshala_title:0 "Export the Khateshala"
 S15_export_the_khateshala_desc:0 "While Karassk may have been our nominal overlord, those who truly oppressed us were the naga. Abusive, corrupt, and eager to extract every possible drop of wealth from Karshyr to use in their endless scheming, they caused untold misery. Even now, they remain influential in our mainland holdings, twisting the people against us and conspiring with foreign powers. The khateshala, on the other hand, are honest, kind, and most importantly, loyal to us. As such, the naga will be formally divested of their power in all of our territories, with khateshala appointed to replace them. While some fools will undoubtedly resist this “perversion of the natural order”, it is necessary in order to ensure that all of the riches of Karassk remain in Karshyr, just as the naga once ensured the opposite."

 S15_finalise_the_crater_city_title:0 "Finalise the Crater City"
 S15_finalise_the_crater_city_desc:0 "The Crater-City has garnered a new title, one that describes the newest era of its existence: The Western Gateway to Taneyas.\n\nKarshyr has once again become one of the greatest cities of the lizardfolk, restored and expanded to heights that were previously unimaginable. Our citadels crest over the edges of the crater and our ports bustle with more activity than ever before, not an hour passes without a ship sailing into - or out of - the docks. The shipyards, capable of creating grand vessels well-suited for trade or warfare, have become a staple of the city, one which cannot be ignored by even our rivals.\n\nTraders and travelers from the west, should they seek goods from - or entry into - Taneyas, arrive at our ports and barter at our markets before venturing further into lizardfolk lands.\nWe once lamented our position on the periphery of the lizardfolk world, it has now become our greatest asset."

 S15_the_great_pearl_cave_title:0 "The Great Pearl Cave"
 S15_the_great_pearl_cave_desc:0 "Our alliance with the Merfolk has once more borne fruit: The Merfolk of Cheneshkad have recently shared the discovery of a peculiar cave with us. This cave is seemingly home to a large quantity of pearls, which, according to the Merfolk, seem to be regenerating without any external intervention.\n\nWe have sent multiple expeditions of Hydromancers to investigate this cave and its regenerative abilities and according to their reports, the cave seems to regenerate its pearls via some sort of magical means. Expeditionary Reports agree that large scale extraction of these pearls would be sustainable; due to this, we have decided to prepare for the harvest of the Great Pearl Cave's bounty."

 S15_improve_the_project_title:0 "Improve the Projects"
 S15_improve_the_project_desc:0 "The art of aquaculture, once engaged in by only a few disconnected fishermen and generally considered an economically irrelevant subsistence practice, has now turned into the backbone of our economy. It is the key to our control of trade, both within our borders and without, and without it we would have collapsed long ago.\n\nWe must consolidate our aquacultural projects so that we may expand our reach and make our farms more efficient. Our guilds are severely lacking recruits, but with further innovation we can entice those wishing to explore the bounds of what is possible. And by building towns and ports around the sites, we can ensure a healthy supply of workers and ease shipment of the products throughout the gulf."

 S15_control_the_gulf_title:0 "Control the Gulf"
 S15_control_the_gulf_desc:0 "Our fleets grow larger by the day, now patrolling the entirety of the Gulf's waters unimpeded. No other realm that maintains a navy in Taneyas is capable of threatening ours. We own various key portions of the Gulf's coastline, ensuring our foothold on the mainland is unchallenged. Even if they wished to, none in Taneyas could hinder our expansion.\n\nYet our footholds on the Gulf's coastline are still in need of consolidation. No longer shall we merely hold portions of the coast; instead we shall lay claim to the entirety of the Adzalaz Gulf. It shall be under our rule forevermore, and we shall become the rightful lieges of Taneyas' entire coast."

 S15_ousted_slavers_title:0 "Ousted Slavers"
 S15_ousted_slavers_desc:0 "The Baashidi of Qasri Abeesooyinka have been known to enslave our fellow lizardfolk and exploit them for their labor. Their rule has now come to a definitive end, our armies marching through their cities and smashing their lizard cages. In doing this we have reclaimed the lands that surround the sunken ancient capital of the 330th empire, Arskitse, and ensured that our kin shall no longer be the chattel of another people.\n\nWhile some of our advisors argue that we should return unto them their treatment of our kin, we have decided that we shall not stoop to their level. Instead we shall introduce our aquacultures to their lands and permit the Baashidi to partake in their operation. Such a partnership will ensure their cooperation and fealty without the need to resort to slavery."


 S15_a_beachhead_secured_title:0 "A Beachhead Secured"
 S15_a_beachhead_secured_desc:0 "Karrask once paraded itself as our benevolent overlord, our so-called protector. Lies. In truth, they are tyrants, thieves, and brutal oppressors. For millennia, they’ve bound us in chains—through their naga rule and hollow prophecies.\n\nBut now, Karrask lies broken, gasping on their deathbed. And we will be the ones to silence that final breath. From their ashes, we will rise—not as some forgotten city on the edge of Taneyas, but as a nation, free to act, to prosper, and to rule on our own terms."

 S15_avenge_the_millenia_title:0 "Avenge the Millenia"
 S15_avenge_the_millenia_desc:0 "A millennium ago we stepped into Karassk to submit to their king. Our fleet lay in ruin, our once great city charred by the scars of war and thousands of our finest lay dead on the ground, never to return to their homes. We were left crippled and humiliated for an age, our city forgotten to time and eroded into the ruins which surround us and furthermore the Naga were enforced upon us, enslaving us to the whims of Karassk.\n\nAnd now we walk into Karassk, the victors of the war and the masters of ourselves once more. We have much to repair within Karshyr and beyond, but the first step will be removing our ties to Karassk and the Naga they imposed upon us. Their imperial palace will be set ablaze with their false kings and naga inside. And the first fire’s kindling will be the Treaty of Servitude we signed a millennium ago."

 S15_karshyr_prosperous_title:0 "Karshyr Prosperous"
 S15_karshyr_prosperous_desc:0 "For the first time in a millennium, Karshyr is free. No longer do we reside in isolation from the rest of our kin, no longer do we suffer Karassk's yoke upon us. This freedom, however, is merely the first step toward our new future.\n\nOur armies have claimed many of Karassk's former territories, which now lie firmly within our control - we have demonstrated that we are not to be trifled with. None in Taneyas would dare to ignore us anymore, nor can they deny our growing influence. \n\nKarshyr rises once again, this time, far more powerful than ever before. A new age beckons for our nation - an age of prosperity."

 S15_eclipse_the_sapphire_title:0 "Eclipse The Sapphire"
 S15_eclipse_the_sapphire_desc:0 "The Sapphire of Taneyas, Khugra, sits at the estuary of the Adzalaz River. This river acts as an easily traversable road connecting inland Taneyas, especially the areas around Lake Lasadza and the open waters of the Adzalaz Gulf. This position, nigh in the center of the Adzalaz Gulf and at the mouth of one of the most important rivers in all of Taneyas, is highly valuable, as it allows for wide-reaching control over trade throughout the Gulf.\n\nIf we were to secure Khugra as our own, we would be one step closer to controlling the economic heart of Taneyas. By extension, we would become one of the most important forces in the lizardfolk's economic tapestry. For the sake of the prosperity of our people, Khugra must become ours."

 S15_the_city_of_shadows_title:0 "The City of Shadows"
 S15_the_city_of_shadows_desc:0 "The City of Nazhni, once a grand resort city of Karassk and the de facto center of the Karasskas culture, has become a center of corruption in Taneyas. Our merchants tell us that there is a new ware being peddled from the ports and streets of Nazhni, one that is referred to as Nazhyn. From our understanding, this new Nazhyn is a highly addictive product, with various health risks associated with its long-term usage.\n\nAs if the spread of such a substance to our ports was not already reason enough to put a stop to their trade, our diplomats have recently made us aware of a dramatic shift in Nazhni's religious composition. If our diplomats are to be believed, there is a growing cult of Shadow Pact worshippers within the city which are becoming more influential by the day.\n\nThis City of Shadows shall not be permitted to spread its malicious practices; we shall make sure of that."

 S15_formalise_the_council_title:0 "Formalise The Council"
 S15_formalise_the_council_desc:0 "Karshyr has always been underdeveloped, even at our historical zenith; after a millennium of rapacious Naga administration, it has been reduced to the extent where the institutions of state are barely capable of managing Karshyr Proper. This was acceptable when we were a vassal and was barely functional when we stepped onto the mainland but with our control over many major cities its flaws are on full display. In order to alleviate this issue, the heads of the aquaculture guild have been called into Karshyr; in exchange for granting them an advisory council to the Crown, they will manage the day to day running of the major cities of Karshyr and the various aquaculture projects at their flanks."
 S15_formalise_the_council_seat_tt:0 "§YKarshyr§!, §YKarassk§! and §YKhugra§! gain a seat in our new parliament."

 S15_conquer_the_isle_title:0 "Conquer the Isle"
 S15_conquer_the_isle_desc:0 "Karshyr has never been in a more prosperous state than it is now; not even in ancient times did our city maintain such influence and wealth as it does now. Now that our own prosperity is secured, it is time that we turn our focus elsewhere: To our halfling friends in Fahvanosy.\n\nMuch as we helped them in uniting the Southern Isle of Fahvanosy, we shall now assist them in realizing their claim on the rest of Fahvanosy. Ownership over a majority over the Isle would ensure the prosperity of our halfling friends, as their control - and by extension, our control - over the clove trade would be absolute."

 S15_the_merfolk_city_title:0 "The Merfolk City"
 S15_the_merfolk_city_desc:0 "If it were not for the merfolk, our expansion and dominance over the Adzalaz Gulf would not have been nearly as straightforward as it was. Our alliance with them has proven to be highly beneficial, thus it is our turn to offer them something for their assistance. It would not befit us to exploit our allies, we would rather that our people prosper together.\n\nThe merfolk shall be granted a city of their own, one which shall be both represented in the council and placed upon lands ideal for the merfolk's habitation. The estuary of the Khazyna River in Gokadas Soro would be the best candidate for such a settlement.\nOur alliance shall continue to prove prosperous, for both the merfolk and for us."

 S15_the_gulf_united_title:0 "The Gulf United"
 S15_the_gulf_united_desc:0 "Karshyr is no longer merely the richest city in all of Taneyas, it has become the capital of one of the greatest lizardfolk empires this world has ever seen. Our realm has grown to be far more than just our Crater-Capital; it now spans the entirety of the Adzalaz Gulf, and nearly half of all of Taneyas has been united under our banner. The coffers of our cities overflow with coins and trinkets; more wealth than any ancient lizardfolk empire in our records could boast.\n\nBeyond Taneyas, we are renowned throughout all of Sarhal. Legends of our grand fleets’ strength have spread across Sarhal's coasts. We are - by far - the most powerful nation within Sarhal. None of our neighbors are capable of competing with us, either militarily nor economically.\n\nOnly the greatest empires of Cannor are capable of rivaling us."

 S15_the_future_of_karshyr_title:0 "The Future of Karshyr"
 S15_the_future_of_karshyr_desc:0 "If you had seen us a half-millenium ago, you would have seen an unstable island ruled by the exploitative Naga, a crippled economy made to support the despots of Karassk and a subjugated vassal who held no power, economic or political. We weren’t even an afterthought in lizardfolk politics, let alone a contender for control over the Adzalaz Gulf.\n\nNo one would have guessed that we would ever break the chains of Karassk’s rule, and yet we now stand as the undoubtable leader of the Taneyasy lizardfolk. But our path is still yet unclear, for we have no need for further conquest nor wealth, no need to exert ourselves. Many wish for us to pursue the prophecy and declare the 333rd empire, but for once we and the naga agree, we shall never take up that mantle. Our power lies not in prophecy or fate but in our cities and our aquaculture, in our mages and allies. They shall dictate our fate, not the delusions of dead empires."


 S15_introduce_ourselves_title:0 "Introduce Ourselves"
 S15_introduce_ourselves_desc:0 "To most of our lizardfolk kin, the edges of Taneyas are the edges of civilization itself. However, unlike other lizardfolk, we know that there is more to the world. Thanks to our friends in Fahvanosy, we have heard tales of traders from a civilization to the far north of the Salahad. If these tales are to be trusted, these northern lands - and their traders - are more prosperous than all of Taneyas, possessing innumerable riches with which they might barter.\n\nThe Vyzemby have not betrayed our trust before and it is unlikely that they would do so now.\nWe shall seek to contact this northern civilization, so that we might introduce ourselves properly."

 S15_rebuild_karassk_title:0 "Rebuild Karassk"
 S15_rebuild_karassk_desc:0 "Karassk is perhaps the most infamous imperial pretender in all lizardmen history. At the apex of their power, they might well have been declared the fulfiller of the prophecy if it wasn’t for their damaging of the spire at Ashuzal. We have suffered under them longer than any other city; and our enmity runs deep. That being said, there is a reason the city of Karassk became so powerful; it is very well situated and has great natural fisheries. As much as we have suffered under their rule, it would be foolish to leave the place in ruins. With Karassk under our control, we can project power into the Adzalaz Gulf and lock down trade. This new city shall be rebuilt to our specifications however; we will make Karassk truly our city for all time."

 S15_before_cannor_arrives_title:0 "Before Cannor Arrives"
 S15_before_cannor_arrives_desc:0 "Through trade we have learned much of the land of ‘Cannor’. The countries there are wealthy and highly desire our goods, which has been a great boon to us but from what we’ve learned they are likely to be our greatest threat. Their ships are stronger, faster, and can go further than anything we can create, and they have a hunger for distant lands. This means that all our highly valued goods are also making us a prime target and it won’t be long before they can reach us. Before that happens, we must secure our territorial integrity so there is no soft underbelly for them to stab into."

 S15_discuss_the_spire_title:0 "Discuss the Spire"
 S15_discuss_the_spire_desc:0 "As expected, Cannor has arrived to Sarhal in force. Our relations with them are fragile and fraught with misunderstandings, whether it be over the various languages we meet or their unusual diet. While the ink on their maps is still wet, we must make our demands known. We can’t truly enforce a claim over most all of Fangaula but we absolutely must have the spire in the place they’re calling ‘New Hookfield’. Make it known that for all we care, they can have the rest of that jungle – but we will not surrender the spire."

 S15_the_isle_united_title:0 "The Isle United"
 S15_the_isle_united_desc:0 "For the first time in its history, Fahvanosy is free of tribal squabble. With our assistance, our dear allies, the Mazava Halflings, have finally united Fahvanosy under their banner. They are the undisputed rulers of Fahvanosy, the sole controllers of the clove trade, which has already begun to bring them innumerable riches.\n\nWith the clove trade ensuring the stability of their economy and our fleets ensuring the safety of their realm, we are able to experiment with cloves at our pleasure. The Sweetport, Teramzadai, would be the ideal location for our clove experiments. Our halfling friends will not deny our interests and they will certainly not deny our continued trade."


 S15_our_friends_in_fahvanosy_title:0 "Our Friends In Fahvanosy"
 S15_our_friends_in_fahvanosy_desc:0 "Our city's position at the edge of Taneyas has never been ideal. We are too far away from the mainland to meaningfully involve ourselves in the political machinations of our fellow lizardfolk, and for as long as Karassk ruled over our lands, we were unable to maintain any influence in Taneyas, leaving us effectively isolated from our kin. This isolation caused us to seek friends elsewhere, peering out past the edges of lizardfolk civilization.\n\nThat is how we came to forge strong bonds with the Vyzemby Halflings to our southwest. They have proven to be valuable friends and trustworthy trade partners over the last millennium.\nNow that we have freed ourselves from Karassk, we are able to deepen the ties to our halfling friends, so that this friendship may blossom into a full-fledged alliance."

 S15_push_for_amiratsamo_title:0 "Push For Amiratsamo"
 S15_push_for_amiratsamo_desc:0 "For as long as we have known of the Vyzemby Halflings, their southern isle has been divided into many tribes. These tribes seem wholly unable to cooperate, in fact; they have been unable to effectively make any progress towards uniting their lands, whether via diplomacy, nor via warfare.\n\nThe petty squabbles between the Mazava must come to an end - and we have come to the conclusion that this will be achieved with our assistance. We shall provide our military competence - our naval supremacy - to our halfling friends, so that they may finally be capable of uniting their lands.\n\nOnce the southern isle is fully under their control, we can look towards further mutual cooperation."

 S15_the_southern_island_united_title:0 "The Southern Island United"
 S15_the_southern_island_united_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Amiratsamo has replaced the once disjointed and feuding tribes of Fahvanosy's southern isle.\nOur halfling allies have been able to claim the isle for themselves, bringing an end to the petty squabbles of the local tribes and introducing centralized rule to the south of Fahvanosy.\nIt is unlikely that the halflings would have been able to succeed in this endeavor without our assistance, and it is certain, if they had succeeded without us, it would have been with far more bloodshed.\nThe newfound leadership - and the local populace - of Amiratsamo are well aware of their eternal debt to us.\nThus, we are left with a decision to make: Should we formally request Amiratsamo's fealty?"



 S15_friends_in_sarhal_title:0 "Friends in Sarhal"
 S15_friends_in_sarhal_desc:0 "Our defiance of the Prophecy began long before our knowledge of Ravelianism. For many decades we had found ourselves effectively ignored and neglected by the nations in our vicinity, due to said defiance of the Prophecy.\n\nThis, however, is no longer the case. Our shift towards Cannor - our conversion to Ravelianism - has solidified us as the de facto Head of Ravelianism in Taneyas and its surrounding areas. Unlike previously, when we only had a handful of trustworthy allies, we can rest assured that we are now well-connected and will certainly never be left to fight alone."


 S15_exporting_ravelianism_title:0 "Exporting Ravelianism"
 S15_exporting_ravelianism_desc:0 "After having been shown the truth by the Cannorians, they have become much more accepting of our people. While we are happy to accept them as brothers in faith, our conversion has isolated us from other powers in the region. As the faithful of god, it is our responsibility to share the truth with Sarhal and with our large economy we can fund many evangelising missions. If these are successful, there will also be more nations around us that recognize the truth, which will end our diplomatic isolation."

 S15_a_lizard_rectorate_title:0 "A Lizard Rectorate"
 S15_a_lizard_rectorate_desc:0 "The Ravelians of Cannor have begun to accept us as their fellow Ravelians in full, no longer believing our conversion to have been a dishonest ploy for financial gain. Despite this, the Ravelians do not see the Shadow Swamp as a threat and have little interest in supporting us, and the rest of Sarhal, in protecting our people.\n\nWe cannot permit the Ravelians to ignore our plight: both for the sake of our people and for all of Sarhal, we must leverage the influence we hold over the Ravelian Rectorate. We will convince them both to acknowledge the Shadow Swamp as a threat and support us in our endeavors against it."

 S15_contain_the_shadow_title:0 "Contain the Shadow"
 S15_contain_the_shadow_desc:0 "Our kin shall never be subjugated again, of that we can be certain.\n\nThe Shadow Swamp, the festering mire of Sarhal, that once threatened to burn the world to the ground, has been pushed out of the ancestral lands of the lizardfolk forevermore. For as long as we reside in Taneyas, we shall act as a bulwark against them.\n\nWith the greatest threat against our people contained, certain to fail against us should they attempt to expand into Taneyas once more, we can now shift our focus elsewhere."


 S15_investigate_the_spires_title:0 "Investigate the Spires"
 S15_investigate_the_spires_desc:0 "The Spires have long been the centres of lizardfolk philosophy, their presence dominating the sky around the cities that were built in their shadow. Yet no records tell of their construction, nor any true attempts to understand why or how they were built. No lizardfolk has dared tamper with the spires due to their philosophical and symbolic importance, especially so in regards to the naga. We have no need for such caution: we care not for the protests of the Naga and the God Fragment is proof that ancient artifacts can and should be studied. We shall start at New Hookfield as a proof of concept and find out what can be taken and learnt from the spires."

 S15_relics_from_near_and_far_title:0 "Relics From Near and Far"
 S15_relics_from_near_and_far_desc:0 "The Spire project was conceived as a way to bring the ideas of Ravelianism to the lizardfolk, and only secondarily as an attempt to understand the spires. We did not anticipate finding working machinery, let alone to the calibre that was uncovered in the caverns surrounding the spire at New Hookfield. The Hookfield port, once a minor port used as a supply stop for Cannorian trips, has become a capital of trade scarcely seen in these parts since the days of the Ananoma, enjoying a roaring trade from the export of these relics to the Ravelians of Cannor.\n\nAnd yet however profitable the relic trade is, we can do so much more with these objects. The Hydromancer’s Guild have already been drafting plans and using their wealth to import the relics of Aelantir for further study. With our backing, these plans – once mere dreams – could become reality."

 S15_the_prototype_project_title:0 "The Prototype Project"
 S15_the_prototype_project_desc:0 "When the Mages began this endeavour it was seen as a pipe dream, a complete pipedream. When we found the relics under the spire, the project transformed into a theoretical experiment; everyone saw it no longer as a dream but as a question. But it was still seen as purely theoretical, the level of investment and devotion required for such a project was too great for anyone to seriously pursue it.\n\nEven to acquire the raw power needed to enhance the magical essence of an individual has always been seen as simply impossible. But for Karshyr to achieve independence was impossible; to control the Gulf was impossible; we shall prove that the Khateshala project is possible as well."

 S15_the_khateshala_project_title:0 "The Khateshala Project"
 S15_the_khateshala_project_desc:0 "To outsiders Karshyr has always seemed like an unorthodox case. We are lizardfolk whose historical interests have long laid outside to the mainland of Taneyas and instead upon the islands, the coast of the Adzalaz gulf and the halfling Summer Isles. We have no native naga, no drive to fulfill the prophecy that has driven the lizardfolk since history began. Our power is defined not by our army but by our fleet and our money. We are a Ravelian nation defined not by artificery but by magic.\n\nAnd yet looking an inch further everything is clear. Our power and interests align perfectly: we choose to stay at the sea where our power and thus security is absolute, we have no interest in the prophecy because it props up the naga who have no place in Karshyr. We are a Ravelian nation who seeks to bring magic to the people, not through artificery but through the arcane traditions of our ancestors, and we are on the verge of achieving our dreams. For once we complete the Khateshala project, our magic and artificery shall be one and the same."

We will not abandon our mages, they have been pivotal in securing our independence and prosperity, but we can incorporate the rising artificers into our existing Aquaculture guild. Whilst this will narrow our artificers’ efforts towards the priorities of the Aquaculture guild, it would also provide far more equipment, expertise and personnel to our aquaculture whilst still maintaining a devoted artificery core to further our research elsewhere."

Yet much of our populace remains firmly devoted to the Prophecy of the Final Empire, a prophecy which we have not only forsaken, but actively defy.\n\nThis dissonance between the upper and lower classes is detrimental to our Kingdom's stability; it is thus imperative that we show the lower classes the value of Ravelianism for our nation. We must convince them of the affluence, prosperity, and security it can provide, alongside bolstered relations with Cannor.\n\nOnce they understand what Ravelianism and, by extension, the Ravelians can do for us, they will understand why we are no longer beholden to an ancient prophecy."

 flavour_karshyr.3.t: "The Riches of Karshyr"
 flavour_karshyr.3.d: "Four lizardfolk, richly attired, step into the newly renovated council room of the crater city. The first to speak is the Grand Architect of Karshyr, the designer of our now glorious capital.\n“The project is finished. We can now all stand proud as a true city of the lizardfolk, no longer must we cower in shame as a remote island province. We are once more a meeting point for all lizardfolk cultures and creations. Our citadels reach for the skies and our ports control the seas. The next step is to develop the seas themselves.”\n\nThe next to speak is the head of the Aquaculture Guild, the lizard behind the backbone of our trade economy.\n“We should prioritise the production of dyes above all else. They are our most valuable export, our key to economic security and prosperity, the beating heart fuelling our continued independence. By devoting our efforts primarily towards our dyeworks, our production is sure to be catapulted to a whole new level and we may acquire the wealth to dominate the Gulf forevermore.”\n\nThe third to speak is our Grand Admiral, the master of the seas and supreme guardian of our island.\n“To focus solely on the dyes is folly, they are profitable enough as is. What we lack isn’t wealth, it’s lizardfolk for our fleets and our armies, it’s the ability to match the kingdoms of the mainland in combat. We need the food sources to maintain a much larger population, equal to the mainlanders who we already outpace in terms of prosperity.”\n\nThe 4th and Final to speak is [Root.Monarch.GetName] who has the final verdict, which is…"
 flavour_karshyr.3.a: "We should further invest into our dyes."
 flavour_karshyr.3.b: "We should diversify our projects."

 flavour_karshyr.4.t: "Fisheries of Karassk"
 flavour_karshyr.4.d: "Walking down the streets and docks of Karassk reveals just how truly ancient the city is and how deep its roots are. Some see the Anzaran city, the old beating heart of the western half of the 332nd Empire and the home of a fleet not seen anywhere else since its collapse. Some see the city of the Karassian Empire, seat of the tyrants under whom which we chafed for a millenium, its great lighthouse illuminated by the Emerald of the Seas to this day. Some see the revenge we took upon the city, the charring of those who took everything from us, their blackened palace an eternal emblem of our victory.\n\nAnd yet Karassk, regardless of the marks left by history, remains an eternal centre for lizardfolk trade and politics. For as you walk the streets and docks of Karassk, you see the traders from near and far. You see humans haggling and selling all kinds of wares, elves trading their silks and swords, dwarves unloading ores and gems of such a quality unheard of even by the Empires of old. On our side, we sell dyes of such variety and quality that they are sold for a monarch’s ransom in Cannor; we sell spices shipped from around the Gulf as well as coffee from even further afield.\n\nKarassk has cultivated its own native goods to sell, of course; the bountiful seas around the city have always provided it with food, but without the ability to exploit their empire they have now switched to exporting their natural wealth. We may be loath to help Karassk but we would be foolish to abandon the potential of the bountiful seas, for early experiments have already bolstered production and the cultivation of an aquatic variation of the Tchoken has proven highly successful. With formalised investment from the Aquaculture Guild in Karshyr, Karassk could once again become a city to rival any other… with the exception of our beloved crater city, naturally."
 flavour_karshyr.4.a: "Fish for me and thee!"

 flavour_karshyr.5.t: "Unlikely Prosperity"
 flavour_karshyr.5.d: "It seems that our cousins on the mainland have been wrong about more than just the naga. While they regard humans as nothing more than savages who only understand violence, in recent years we have benefited greatly from trading with those hailing from Cannor. They have proven eager to buy lizardfolk goods, both those we produce domestically – such as dyes and pearls – and those made on the mainland. In return, we have received goods we cannot make ourselves: fine woolen cloth, manufactured metals, and a strange brown plant they call ’tobacco’. Perhaps most significantly, we have received access to their advances, specifically with regards to firearms and shipbuilding, which has allowed us to pull ahead of our more insular mainland cousins.\n  All of this interaction has also led to the spread of more controversial ideas. Chief among these are the various religions of the Cannorians, with their dizzying array of gods for seemingly every conceivable aspect of life. Their attempts at proselytization have been mostly unsuccessful, both due to their lack of evidence for their outrageous claims and the fact that their priests often fight about whom one should address as ‘chief god’. These ‘Corinites’ and ‘Adeanics’ have apparently laid waste to much of Cannor in their struggle, and we have no desire for such things to repeat in Sarhal. The only missionaries whose arguments make a modicum of sense are the so-called ‘Ravelians’, who seem almost as devoted to inquiry and learning as to their abstract God.\n  While some of our subjects have converted to this sect simply to negotiate superior trade deals, many have less mercenary motives. While the Khateshala have done their best, many lizardfolk feel spiritually adrift with the departure of the naga and the growing doubt in the Prophecy. As such, they have turned to Ravelianism to find meaning in the world."

 flavour_karshyr.6.t: "The Question of Nazhyn"
 flavour_karshyr.6.d: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] rifles through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] letters, it seems like the decision is unanimous.\n“We must utilise the Nazhyn, it would grant us untold riches.”\n“It would let us weaken our enemies and control our populace…”\n“We would need no allies with the power it provides!”\nA veritable flood of letters like these, from merchants who see only their pockets as important, to generals who see only military power as valuable, to nobles who care not for the people. And yet everything they said is true, the Nazhyn would bestow upon us untold wealth…\n\nBefore [Root.Monarch.GetName] can decide, however, two people burst in, the head of the Aquaculture Guild and [event_country.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“You cannot allow the Nazhyn to taint aquaculture, it would ruin the art of the system, there would be no effort, no integrity and no caution – we would overextend ourselves in an instant. I know that it would be profitable, but the costs aren’t worth it. Establish another dye farm instead, show the world that we care and that we will not abandon the lessons that made us who we are.”\n\n[event_country.Monarch.GetName] takes over, practically breathless. “Exploiting the Nazhyn would shatter our relationship; our population has only seen a taste of it but those who have can never forget, they can and will do anything for another taste of this poison. You would abandon all that we have built together for mere profit!”\n\nIn response, [Root.Monarch.GetName] says"

 flavour_karshyr.7.t: "The Future of Karshyr"
 flavour_karshyr.7.d: "Five dignitaries stand in the grand council hall of Karshyr: four lizardfolk and a halfling. First, [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Master of the Gulf and our great nation, who wishes to secure Karshyr’s prosperity forevermore. Second, the head of the Aquaculture Guild, their place earned through their wealth, the backbone of Karshyr’s conquests. She wishes to further refine the art of aquaculture to perfection. Third, the mayor of Karshyr, representing the Council of the Coast and the millions dwelling in their cities, who wishes to maintain and expand their borders even further. Fourth, the archmage of the Hydromancers, their control over the seas instrumental to Karshyr’s security. He wishes to keep Cannorian Damestear and Aelantir’s relics flowing into our realm. Finally, there is the ruler of Amiratsamo, our oldest and most critical ally, who wishes to facilitate the expansion of our trade within Sarhal and beyond.\n\nThe meeting, despite its importance, does not take long. The dream of Khatalashya has long since been forgotten by all in the meeting, if it was ever a possibility in their minds. And if history is any guide, Karshyr’s current lofty position will eventually fall to the decadence that has plagued the empires of old if nothing is done. Therefore the meeting moves towards a previously unheard of idea, formally converting to a Cannorian religion.\n\nWeeks later, hundreds if not thousands celebrate in the grand council hall of Karshyr. The head of the Aquaculture Guild discusses adopting artificers into his guild. The mayor of Karshyr welcomes the new rectors of Karshyr. The archmage talks with traders from afar, promising the bounty of the ocean in exchange for the Damestear of Moonisle, and [event_country.Monarch.GetName] pledges to keep the waters safe and the ships provisioned. And next to the throne of Karshyr, [Root.Monarch.GetName] celebrates with the High Rector, safe in the knowledge that we will go further than any empire before us."

 flavour_karshyr.8.d: "To say that we have come far in the last centuries would be an understatement, our island of once squabbling tribes has become the uncontested hegemon of Fahvanosy and our cloves have made us wealthy beyond compare, barring our patrons in Karshyr. And now those patrons who have brought us to where we are request that we convert to the Ravelian church alongside them, though they of course insist we are in no way obliged to."

 flavour_karshyr.9.t: "The Saint of Karshyr"
 flavour_karshyr.9.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] leans back against the throne.\nRepresentatives of the Khateshala and the Hydromancer's Guild had come before [Root.Monarch.GetName] with two versions of a draft for a petition, one that was to be sent to the Ravelian Rectorate.\n\n“The people do not comprehend - they do not believe in - the teachings of the Ravelians. If you wish for the populace to show their devotion, to offer their faith to Ravelianism, we must ensure that they feel as if the faith has ties to them, as if it represents them,” spoke Sritiz, head of the Khateshala.\n\n“Our petition aims to do just that: If we were to have a Saint of our own, a Saint of our people, perhaps it would be easier to convince them of our new ways,” Sritiz continued, before offering a nod to a hydromancer who stood to his right.\n\nRykhsana, a well-studied chronicler and talented hydromancer, offered a respectful curtsy to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and elaborated: “I have - at the behest of the Khateshala - scoured our records for candidates for Sainthood and found two which might be suitable. Thus, as is only proper, we have come before you for both your blessing for the petition and for your decision regarding which candidate we should recommend to the Rectorate.”\n\nThe hydromancer paused, awaiting [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s response.\n\n“A Saint of the Lizardfolk? - If you deem it necessary…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] gestured towards Sritiz, “then you shall have my blessing. Perhaps the Cannorians might consider this further evidence of our devotion. So then – who are these candidates?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] questioned, shifting attention towards Rykhsana.\n\nRykhsana, barely restraining her enthusiasm, eagerly offered the elaboration that [Root.Monarch.GetName] had requested: “The first candidate hearkens back to the Anzara Empire, 'The Anonymous of Karshyr', a hydromancer and chronicler that once graced the streets of our city, an individual of great selflessness whom we have to thank for many of the oldest chronicles within our archives - the history of our city.”\n\n“The second candidate would be Dzankot III Seabreaker, one of your predecessors, the Mage-King to whom we owe our freedom from Karassk. His highness' military victories and naval prowess are the basis for our city's entire existence ever since - without Dzankot III, it is highly doubtful that we would have ever been freed from Karassk's tyranny.”"

 flavour_karshyr.10.t: "A Successful procedure"
 flavour_karshyr.10.d: "Once Karshyr was an island, nothing more, nothing less than an outpost of the ancient empires.\nOnce Karshyr was a town, a port for controlling the halfling vassals of our predecessors.\nOnce Karshyr was a city, the hub of the western Adzalaz, second only to Karassk.\nOnce Karshyr was a vassal, a cog in the empire of Karassk, their first subject.\nOnce Karshyr was an Ikatara, one of the squabbling states of Taneyas, fighting for a meaningless goal.\nOnce Karshyr was a kingdom, the Master of the Gulf, the face of the lizardfolk to Halann.\n\nAnd now Karshyr is an empire, the greatest state of Sarhal, if not Halann as a whole. We have stood by as 332 empires came and went, watching them rise and fall, witnessing their glory and their collapse. We will not repeat their mistakes. We will not be dominated by the promise of future prosperity, we will seize it for ourselves. We have fought and bled for our independence and we won’t surrender it to the naga merely because they claim it was foretold – after all, the prophecy never cared for us when we were subjects. We shall not go into history like Karassk, an empire which enslaved anyone it could. Instead we shall recreate the balance of magic within our island from scratch, creating wonders that will secure our name and our seas forevermore.\n\nThis is where our Khateshala come in. Their studies of the spires, once considered mere folly, have yielded the resources and advances to conceive of magic at a scale once thought unreachable. We shall begin to transform the entire population of our island into Khateshala, who form the core of our magic and our fleet. And after much testing, we are ready to implement the next step of the project: to transform our royal family into Khateshala."

 flavour_karshyr.50.t: "Transfer of Technology"
 flavour_karshyr.50.d: "While our aquaculture is famous throughout the world, we lag behind in other areas. Much of our wealth is spent on Cannorian metals and manufactured goods, and our shipbuilders are left in awe of foreign designs. To remedy this, many within the court have proposed expending significant resources to entice Cannorian craftsmen to live in our country, at least for a time, in order to teach us their methods. This would also prove that we lizardfolk are not ‘monsters’ who eat whoever we come across like the green-skinned orcs are rumoured to."
 flavour_karshyr.50.a: "Study their methods."
 flavour_karshyr.50.b: "We do not need their help."

 flavour_karshyr.52.t: "Acknowledgement of the Anonymous"
 flavour_karshyr.52.d: "Our recent endeavor to align more closely to the Cannorians has been successful; they no longer deem us to be uncivilized and perceive us as equals. This shift in perception has led to many Cannorians exploring the history of our people and our city, slowly discovering the Chronicles of the Anonymous in our archives.\n\nThe Anonymous of Karshyr was a renowned chronicler and hydromancer who, in the age of the Anzara Empire, took it upon themselves to note down much of the history of our people, providing some of the oldest chronicles that we have in our archives. Without their efforts, we would know very little of our city's ancient past.\n\nTheir moniker, 'The Anonymous', was granted to them for their lack of self-acknowledgement in their writings. Despite their valiant effort to chronicle our people's stories and history, they selflessly omitted themselves from their works, to the extent that we have little knowledge of who they truly were.\n\nNow that the Cannorians are both familiar with our civilization's past and deem us to be their equals, many consider it time to spread the works of The Anonymous, so that others may learn of our history.\n\nThe Hydromancer's Guild, with the encouragement of many of the academics of our kingdom, has petitioned the Order of Chroniclers to accept the works of the Anonymous into their archive."

Instead, he claims to be a Ravelian, belonging to an order of scholars seeking to unravel the mysteries of the world. He requests permission to set up a ‘lodge’, or a local branch of his society, in exchange for a generous donation to the crown. Upon questioning other foreigners in our court, they have revealed that Ravelians are generally harmless scholars, who are quite influential already among the merchant classes. Some of our advisors, however, have cautioned that these scholars could attempt to undermine our people’s faith in the Prophecy. Should we accept their offer?"

Many of these naysayers were appeased, however, by the fact that our new friends were an ocean away and thus unlikely to compete with us directly. Now, however, they are establishing colonies in what has long been considered by all civilized people as rightful lizardfolk territory. More aggressive members of our government are calling for military action, while those aligned with merchant interests have pointed out that trade with these new outposts will be worth more than a scrap of jungle could ever hope to be."

 flavour_karshyr.62.d: "Our relationship with Cannor has been blooming since we were able to secure the spire at New Hookfield; without fear that they will encroach on that hallowed artifact, we can be much more open in diplomacy. This has also been aided by the fact that we have been increasing our production of both rare and new goods. The Cannorian traders have always been entranced by our dyes, while fish and salt are staple goods which will always be valuable to those travelling across the seas.\n\nHowever, the real breakout export for Cannor has been our pearls. Jewelry for the nobles is so prevalent within Cannor that gem shortages are frequent and the riches found deep within the Dwarovar are both limited and hard to access. By contrast, we have been able to ship mountains of these precious jewels across the seas.\n\nOur primary market has been Pearlsedge, who are attempting to maintain their monopoly over the gems in Cannor. They have come to our court wishing to purchase some of our pearl farm aquaculture designs for themselves. Whilst this would hurt our economy in the long run, they are offering a ship of silver and we are after all informal allies."

 flavour_karshyr.70.d: "The prophecy has been sacred to the lizardfolk people for as long as anyone can remember. The repeated treacheries of the Naga, however, have dented its shine and cast a shadow over its legitimacy. Ravelian missionaries have made many converts among some of our disillusioned subjects, and many merchants have also embraced the faith in order to secure better trade deals.\nThis development has not, however, been without pushback. Many still hold to the Prophecy and see open rejection of it as an abomination. A few of these individuals have asked us to suppress the Ravelians, while the Ravelians want to continue their missionary work unobstructed."

 flavour_karshyr.71.d: "We have been conflicted on our path for over a century; almost all lizardfolk had urged us to forgive the naga and fulfil the prophecy that mired the lizardfolk in stagnation for time immemorial. We could never do that, both for the inevitable decay that follows adherence to the flawed prophecy and the betrayal of the Naga when we were under the rule of Karassk. However this left us spiritually adrift, conquering for security and wealth without any higher purpose, fragile with no reason to stay united.\n\nThat is, until we encountered the Ravelians, a group willing to accept us and adopt us into their organisation, giving us a true guiding purpose and a worthy use for the wealth of the Gulf. We have seen many Ravelian rectors come and go from Karshyr – humans, elves and dwarves coming to our shores to preach to our people and our council. We even hosted the High Rector upon our conversion, taking the vows to protect the people of Sarhal and expand the word of Ravelianism.\n\nAnd now we see one of our own taking up the mantle of the High Rectorate, their position earned through our diligent work in expanding the knowledge of the God Fragment as well as our studies of the spires. It is somewhat surreal experiencing this momentous event. Our once aimless state is now the head of one of the most powerful organisations on Halann - what further evidence of our efforts and devotion to embracing the ideals of Ravelianism could there be!"
