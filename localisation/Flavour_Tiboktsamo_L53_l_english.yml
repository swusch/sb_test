 L53_sunken_citadel_title:0 "Sunken Citadel"
 L53_sunken_citadel_desc:0 "The ache of Torapinoma is familiar to many halflings, who gaze across the sea towards that long ruined citadel. Once great, the predations of barbarians and nature itself have weathered away its proud walls. Squatters and looters infest its halls, defiling it with their presence. This can no longer be allowed."
 L53_sunken_citadel_tt_1:0 "If §Y[5763.GetName]§! is uncolonised:"

 L53_the_place_of_lizards_title:0 "The Place of Lizards"
 L53_the_place_of_lizards_desc:0 "With any questions on the place of lizards put to rest, it is time we ready Drongray's shrine. Though talk of the spire in the center of this tower being of lizardfolk make rather than ancient halflings is superstition at most, the association makes this an ideal location for such a shrine regardless."

 L53_knowing_better_title:0 "Knowing Better"
 L53_knowing_better_desc:0 "There are those among the Fangaulans who claim to be scholars. In the lawless and divided lands of Negefama, there is a repository of the collected works of these so-called intellectuals. Such quant notions should be disregarded. Let our technological superiority speak for itself, as we show the humans what true scholarship looks like."

 L53_the_fangaulan_archives_title:0 "The Fangaulan Archives"
 L53_the_fangaulan_archives_desc:0 "Though they contain no worthwhile scholarship unknown to our own researchers, the Fangaulan Archives have nonetheless been confiscated. While filled with inaccuracies, some of these texts have proven useful.\n\nA long standing theory among Amezetany scholars is the existence of so-called 'Ghost Halflings'. Much like us, these Halflings did not retreat during the fall of the Ananoma. Rather, they fortified settlements and hid in the woods... More than perhaps any other, these are our long-lost kin. They must be reintegrated.\n\nOf course, the ill-educated and superstitious Fangaulans failed to recognize these ghost halflings. Instead, scared of their power and mastery of Jyvas arts of illusion, sightings of these Halflings have been misinterpreted as sightings of an imaginary boogey-man creature called 'Eloko.' An entity that supposedly takes the form of a Halfling to deceive and devour unlucky travelers. No such creature exists, and further reports of its existence are to be treated as anti-halfling rhetoric punishable by fine. The existing reports shall be catalogued and sought out, until all ghost halfling communities are accounted for and reintegrated."

 L53_ghosts_busted_title:0 "Ghosts Busted"
 L53_ghosts_busted_desc:0 "With the grateful ghost Halflings having been peacefully integrated or otherwise reeducated, and any remaining Kaino and Jiromji dissidents dealt with, it is time to place our focus on Latranoma. The ancient citadel, shrouded in mystery and darkness, is the perfect location for the clergy of Jyva.\n\nReminder to all citizens that Eloko is not real, and that spreading rumors of such a creature is a punishable offense. By order of the Tower Commander, however, this restriction is to be waived for immigrants leaving villages decimated by dissident action. But you are reminded, and encouraged to remind others, that these people are merely processing the trauma of the conflict and had no true experience with supernatural entities."

 L53_declaring_a_kolovadoy_title:0 "Declaring a Kolovadoy"
 L53_declaring_a_kolovadoy_desc:0 "Across the nation and across the seas, people cheered and sang joyous songs at the arrival of the Kolovadoy! None could doubt their chosenhood, for the power of Kolo himself radiated off of them. Even in the den of thieves and brigands of Bibyobi, they spoke in fear and reverence. In Kunolo, the fat traitors quaked in fear as joyous masses of the oppressed Halflings, rightful rulers of Kolonama, awaited liberation. In Rayafo, the cowardly Meblic dynasty seethed and stewed in their own inadequacy. So it was, when Kolo's Champion was made Tower Commander!"

 L53_our_claim_vindicated_title:0 "Our Claim Vindicated"
 L53_our_claim_vindicated_desc:0 "With the reclamation of Kolonama, peace, law, and order have been restored to these turbulent lands. The brigands of Bibyobi have been put down, like the beasts they claimed to tame. Of the halflings of Kolonama, the faithful have been liberated and the traitors await their punishment. In the face of such victory, the priests of Jyva gladly endorsed our claim! There is no truth to any rumors of bribery or blackmail, report anyone spreading such misinformation to your local garrison. Stay safe, praise Kolo."

 L53_trials_for_traitors_title:0 "Trials for Traitors"
 L53_trials_for_traitors_desc:0 "Freedom, liberty, and justice! It is on this national holiday that we remember the trials that brought these virtues back to Kolonama. When the heinous actions of traitorous halflings were punished, those who forsook Kolo for the false gods of Fangaula. Still the cheers echo through the city, when all Halfling slaves were avenged and the false equity of Kunolo was replaced with rightful meritocracy."

 L53_eternal_vigil_title:0 "Eternal Vigil"
 L53_eternal_vigil_desc:0 "To err is mortal, and even the Kolovadoy, chosen by divines, is such. We should remember this, and follow their example. For though they, in an act of misplaced kindness, were too gentle on the traitorous Kunolon dissidents, they learned from their mistake and corrected it. Now, The Tower's watch is eternal. Its gaze reaches from Tiboktsamo to Kolonama, watching over all citizens and ensuring their safety and their loyalty."

 L53_glorious_return_title:0 "Glorious Return"
 L53_glorious_return_desc:0 "For millennia, The Tower stood tall and guarded over Kolonama. The people of Tiboktsamo never fell, never retreated, never faltered, never betrayed our ideals. Our long vigil has not ended, but our exile has. At last, there is the rightful rulership of Kolonama. The city, rebuilt and restored, is worthy of a Jakatany should there be a Jakatany worthy of it. Once again, Kolo's people shall be ruled from the home of Kolo's Shrine."

 L53_a_prophecy_fulfilled_title:0 "A Prophecy Fulfilled"
 L53_a_prophecy_fulfilled_desc:0 "From Latranoma to Vadronoma, all the lands of the coast belong to their rightful owners. There are none who dare challenge the truth of Kolo's prophecy, for it has been made manifest onto the world. What awaits us now is greater than prophecy, a destiny of our own manifestation. May the Kolovadoy look upon their legacy with pride and joy, knowing they have created a better world for all.\n\nVyoronsi forever! Vyoronsi forever! Vyoronsi forever!\n\n§YWarning: Completing this mission will form Vyoronsi as if you had done so via event.§!"

 L53_divided_they_fall_title:0 "Divided, They Fall"
 L53_divided_they_fall_desc:0 "Barbarians are fickle creatures, incapable of governing themselves or curtailing their baser impulses. Look no further than the people of Zuvavim and Mihitarib, whose once mighty alliance proved far too great for Rayafo to overcome. Though we would certainly have defeated both, there was no need. For it is in the nature of the barbarian to destroy themselves, as the lawlessness of both nations allowed for pirates bearing their flag to reign within the Sea of Lel. Their own corruption saw their alliance tear apart, as each blamed the other for this disgrace. So it was, that we brought law back to this lawless land."
 L53_divided_they_fall_tt:0 "Break the alliance between §Y[L09.GetName]§! and §Y[L37.GetName]§!"

 L53_pardons_for_the_worthy_title:0 "Pardons for the Worthy"
 L53_pardons_for_the_worthy_desc:0 "The forefathers of Rayafo were cowards, traitors, and deserters. Those who fled from the fall of Saikinoma, and mingled with the barbarian islanders. But whilst they bare the shame of this, there are those among them who are not beyond redemption. For millennia, Tiboktsamo has offered pardons to Amezetany of the Summer Isles. Those willing to fight for redemption have filled our ranks, with our ranks swelling with eager volunteers each time we reclaim an Ananoma. Now, with Saikinoma reclaimed, it is time to welcome the worthy back to their long lost home. Under The Towers guidance, they shall once again earn the right to call themselves people of the coast."

 L53_punishment_for_the_rest_title:0 "Punishment for the Rest"
 L53_punishment_for_the_rest_desc:0 "Famous for our mercy and benevolence, all citizens of the nation are compelled to remember that The Tower is not weak. Those who reject mercy, who spit in the face of justice, are to be punished. So it was that an example needed to be made at the shrine of Nakinta. For too long, the grandfather of The Pantheon and shaper of the earth has been worshipped falsely. Housed in petty islander hovels, and praised by illiterate fools, his shrine in Mapiltra is an insult. We shall make a true house of learning for this ancient god of wisdom, in a city worthy of his presence."
 L53_punishment_for_the_rest_tt:0 "White Peace with §Y[5821.Owner.GetName]§!"

 L53_the_human_kolovadoy_title:0 "The Human "Kolovadoy""
 L53_the_human_kolovadoy_desc:0 "Warning! Be on the lookout for signs of heresy! Amongst the ill educated hut-dwelling humans of Zuvavim, a vile heresy has been formulated amongst those whose limited intellect grants them enough low cunning for malice. That the Kolovadoy need not be Halfling, that a human could fill this role, is heresy and punishable by death. Any such spreaders of this heresy are to be reported. The Kolovadoy is a Halfling, their arrival confirmed by the priests of Jyva. Do not allow these liars to poison your mind!"

 L53_a_brothers_betrayal_title:0 "A Brothers Betrayal"
 L53_a_brothers_betrayal_desc:0 "When Kolo first fell, we were shown what the lawless chaos of Lel's rule allowed. Kolo's own brother, Turozi, began an affair with Lel. Betrayed kin and wife, Kolo was humiliated within the pantheon as he had been humiliated in the world of mortals. This humiliation ends now. With his shrine reclaimed and his honor restored in this world, we must fight for his honor in the pantheon. Turozi may be the god of warriors, but he must be humbled and reminded of his place. For his strength is nothing compared to that of Kolo."

 L53_impenetrable_shell_title:0 "Impenetrable Shell"
 L53_impenetrable_shell_desc:0 "Following the glorious defeat of Turozi's Champion, Kolo's dominance over his brother was made clear to all. For the world of mortals reflects the world of the gods. Beaten and humbled, the priests of Turozi agree he has sworn off his affair to Lel. A new shrine shall be constructed, where he will serve penance by training Kolos warriors. He shall turn the lizard gate into an impenetrable shell, against any foe. Be they the lizards of the East, or humans of the West. Under the watchful eye of The Tower, and of Kolo, he shall be kept from wandering from his duty again."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.0.t:0 "A Lifetime In Pursuit Of Perfection"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.0.d:0 "There were often times I found myself wondering whether the Southern Tower was the great structure keeping watch over our island home, or the commander whose stern presence seemed so much larger than his body. Though he had not the grotesquely elongated form of a human, he was taller than the titans of legend in spirit. Even at 70 years of age, he was awake before dawn and out inspecting the tower defenses and speaking with the night-guard. By sunlight, he was already in the field drilling the garrison. There was nothing that couldn't be improved, no wall without weaknesses, no form without flaw. No such thing as 'good enough.'\n\nI... Think that is why he was never Kolovadoy. Never chosen. 30 years he served as Commander, and yet he never once attempted to claim the mantle. Never found the perfect moment to reclaim our home. Even when the brigands of Bibyobi sought to steal our home, even when the greedy and fat merchants of Kunolo lost the protection of their Khet masters, even when the first signs of age began to show that he was running out of time... Now, he tells me that it is too late for him. That he will never be Kolovadoy. That he spent his life in pursuit of perfection, and realized too late he had already found it. He may never be Kolovadoy, but I..."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.1.t:0 "Declaring a Kolovadoy"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.1.d:0 "When I was 14, I faced my first Otakazemby. It was a massive, brutish, and misshapen creature, over twice my size. A pirate captured off the shore of our island, given a club and a chance to give its wretched life some meaning. It was the most frightened I'd ever been in my life. Still, I remembered my training and took Turozi's Stance. Deflect its strike with my shield, retaliate with my training spear. I remember that fear turning to pride, when the bruised human finally yielded. The emotions of that day, both fear and pride, were nothing compared to what I felt now.\n\n'You are an upstart brat! Unseasoned, untested in battle, and unworthy!' Haingo Oldstone nearly screamed as his gnarled and aged finger pointed accusatorially at me. I stood head bowed before the Council of the Tower, meek and subservient. This ancient body of lieutenants had chosen, from amongst themselves, the Tower Commanders of Tiboktsamo for nearly a generation. But just yesterday, Andrianary Longwatch had chosen me as his successor, without consulting them, and promptly retired.\n\n'Should the Council will it-' I began meekly 'I will gladly resign-'\n\n'Out of the question' said Naka Mastbreaker, the unofficial head of the council. He had been the expected successor, a man I respected. I would gladly have given the title to him. 'What's done is done. Andrianary has done more than declare you his successor, he has named you Kolovadoy. Whether we like it or not, the people of Tiboktsamo have chosen to believe him in this claim. To step down now would be spitting upon Kolo, tantamount to desertion and treason.' Though calm, there was an edge of anger to his voice. As if behind each word, there was a concealed dagger waiting to strike. 'You will be the Tower Commander. You will attempt to be the Kolovadoy. But while the masses may believe this, we have yet to be convinced. I advise that you heed our council, for if you fall short... We will see you disgraced and denounced as a false Kolovadoy, buried without honors and remembered by none...' He paused, gauging my reaction. The fear he saw in my eyes... I believe it satisfied him. 'But, for now, you have the people's faith. Don't disappoint them.'"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.1.a:0 "I won't. I swear it."
 flavour_tiboktsamo.1.tt:0 "Tanynakazy gains the §YInspiring Leader§! personality."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.2.t:0 "Trials For Traitors"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.2.d:0 "Since becoming Tower Commander, since becoming Kolovadoy, I have spoken before the people of Tiboktsamo enough to start to get used to it. Bold speeches to cheering crowds... But this was different. Where, before, I had spoken to an island, now it felt as if I were speaking to an entire ocean. A sea of faces, disorienting in their diversity. Not just humans and halflings, but lizards, harpies, even the occasional gnoll. Not at all like the homogeny of my home.\n\nWe'd gathered the traitors atop a hastily erected terrace overlooking Kolo's Shrine. The shrine was in far better condition than I had expected. The stories I grew up with always made it sound as if the people of Kunolo had defiled it, but it had been cared for with love. There had even been offerings left on it, when we first arrived. But we were here to bring a greater offering.\n\n'People of Kolonama!' I spoke, my magically enhanced voice booming out to the crowd. 'For too long, you have been misguided and deceived. Through no fault of your own, you have been tricked into fighting against your own liberation. Fighting for your oppressors! No longer! Gathered here are those most deserving of punishment! Halflings like you or me-' I felt a pang of embarrassment, noticing just how many members of the crowd were notably not Halflings, before I continued '-who have chosen greed and subservience over freedom and faith! Traitors to the city of Kolonama, traitors to its people, and traitors to Kolo!' I paused for dramatic effect, though my head tilted ever so slightly to the sound of quiet sobbing. I saw the son of Zafimahaleo Beetelbiter, one of the prior rulers of the city, knelt amongst the other traitors. He was only 15...\n\n'I sentence you to death.' I announced, my gaze once again focused on the crowd. Screams and wails filled the air, as one by one each traitor was pushed from the terrace. As in ancient days we had once thrown the former Jakatany of Kolonama from the peak of the tower, now we executed these traitors who had sided with invaders. But the noises that erupted from the crowd, as each body hit the stonework below, were not cheers. When the last body was still, a crumpled mess against hard stone, the crowd was silent."
 flavour_tiboktsamo.2.a:0 "Why... Why are they not cheering for their liberators?"

 flavour_tiboktsamo.3.t:0 "Divinity Undone"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.3.d:0 "When I was growing up, I'd heard the legends of the Kolovadoy. I'd never, in my wildest dreams, believed I'd become them. I still wasn't sure I believed it... The Kolovadoy of my childhood dreams was a warrior, seeking and slaying evil. I, on the other hand, spent most of my days managing paperwork.\n\n'I had my doubts.' A voice interrupted my thoughts, from one so bold as to enter my office without first knocking. 'But it seems Andrianary was wiser than any of us knew. You truly are the Kolovadoy.' The intruder was Naka Mastbreaker, one of the most highly respected members of The Council of the Tower. He was a man who had once been my superior, had become my peer, and now...\n\n'So I've been told. You have a reason for interrupting me, I assume?' I asked, briskly.\n\n'Of course, Tower Commander. I've come to inform you, and to congratulate you.' Naka said. I'd once thought of him as a lion. Now I saw him as a snake. 'For not only have you reclaimed the home of one god, but you've slain another.' My gaze finally left my papers, to give Naka an unamused glare. He took the hint, and reached his point. 'The faithful of Kunolo are faltering, the false god loses followers every day. Recently, a group of Fangaulan humans fell back on their old barbaric customs. There have been increased reports of violence against lizardfolk, with a new murder nearly every week. Recently, priests of Kunolo have taken to sheltering these lizardfolk and have joined them as targets of vigilante violence.'\n\n'You speak as if murders in Kolo's City are a good thing.' I say, disgusted.\n\n'Worship of Kunolo is illegal, by your own decree. These priests are criminals, why should the laws they flaunt protect them? Currently, we are detaining a great number of accused vigilantes. If we were to release them now... Kolo's worship would reign supreme, with Kunolo's followers out of the way.' Naka argued. Loathe as I was to admit it, there was some merit to the idea. Kunolo's worshippers had been a thorn in the side of our authority since we'd first reclaimed the city. To get rid of them without dirtying our own hands...\n\n'Thank you, that will be all. You will have my decision by tomorrow.' I said, making no effort to hide my disdain. 'And, next time, knock before you enter.'"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.3.a:0 "Very well... If it is their nature, then let them eat each other."
 flavour_tiboktsamo.3.b:0 "Have the perpetrators thrown from the Shrine of Kolo. I will not sever Drongray's tail to spite Kunolo."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.4.t:0 "Another Form of Cowardice"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.4.d:0 "The excitement at meeting our long lost kin had long since vanished, by the time weapons were drawn. I wish I knew where it had gone so wrong... We had been greeted warmly, at first. Honored guests, bringing news of the outside world. But the news we brought these so-called ghosts did not please them like it should have. Later records, penned by my own hand, would state the violence began due to mistranslation. This is a lie. It was understanding one another that brought us to blows.\n\n 'We have seen empires rise and fall, and wish to take no part in it. You would act as Banni before you, thinking yourself a hero while replacing one tyranny with another. If you truly wish to do right by our people, go back to your empire and burn every mention of us from your records. Never seek us again.' It was these words that made us realize, the Ghost Halflings were not our kin. They had hidden, just as the Amezetany of the Summer Isles had fled. It was merely another form of cowardice.\n\nThe man who had spoken those words, their chieftain, lay dead now. His body heaped into a pile of others, around half of the village's warriors, and set alight. Despite the flame, I felt cold. Liberation had come to the Ghost Halflings, as it had come to those of Kolonama. They should have been grateful, and I should have felt like a hero. They were supposed to be our long lost kin, yet it felt as if we were more alone than ever...\n\n I felt a sharp pain in my side. It took me a moment to realize the pain was originating from something tangible, as I heard a young voice cry out in anger. In a flash, I had grabbed the wrist of my assailant and turned his momentum against him. Flipping him over my own body, and slamming him down into the soil, I only refrained from the killing blow upon seeing his face. It was a child, the spitting image of the village's chieftain, twelve years of age at the oldest. He had attempted to tackle me, but his stance was poor and his body was small. My own soldiers rushed to my aid, readying spears and pointing them to my struggling assailant. They readied themselves for the killing blow I had hesitated on.\n\n'At ease!' I commanded, holding up one free hand to stop my warriors while pinning the boy with another. Though the boy continued to struggle, it was little effort for me to hold him down. 'He's just a child, he knows not what he does. But he has a warrior's spirit, like I did when I was his age... Andrianary Longwatch once took me in, sheltered me and raised me to be who I am.'\n\nThe gratitude I craved would not come easy. But... Maybe if we showed these people what we were truly building, they would finally see. Maybe then, they'd see me as a hero. Maybe then I'd feel like it."
 flavour_tiboktsamo.4.a:0 "I will take the boy as my ward. Take the rest back to camp, we'll begin training them to be proper Halflings there."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.5.t:0 "Ghost Stories"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.5.d:0 "'The Boy,' whose name I'd since learned as 'Solo,' had taken some time to warm up to me. But it had taken me substantially less to warm up to him. Andrianary had not lived more than a month past his retirement, old age claiming him in a peaceful sleep. The void he'd left in my life was something I'd hoped to fill with the guidance of the other senior commanders within the tower. But they were all either subordinates awestruck by my chosenhood or power hungry schemers looking to manipulate me. I would never again have a father... But to be one filled a hole I wasn't aware of. Under my tutelage, Solo had become a fierce and disciplined warrior. There were many things I'd done wrong, things I wish I could change, but... Perhaps I could fill the void I created in the boys life, and set something right.\n\nI felt a sharp pain in my side. The dagger was just barely halted by my ribs, missing any vital organs and granting me time to counterstrike. My elbow slammed into my assailant's stomach, as my other hand grabbed the dagger and flung it away. It clattered across the floor, leaving a trail of blood with each bounce. I spun around just in time to see Solo preparing a kick to the chest that sent me tumbling backwards. His form was excellent. I felt proud, a moment before I felt betrayed.\n\nRushing past me, he ran for the dagger he'd attempted to drive into my bowels. I reached out and grabbed his ankle, tripping him and bringing him to the floor with me while simultaneously using him to pull myself back onto my feet. With a leap, I drove my knee into the ground where his back had been just a moment ago. He had rolled out of the way and now attempted to retaliate with another kick, but this time I was ready. Catching his foot by the ankle,I rotated myself over top of him and pinned his back to the ground under my weight while pulling his leg until I heard a sickening snap. My heart ached as I heard him scream, but I did not relent and instead grabbed his other leg and aimed a precise kick into his femur.\n\nStanding up, I left him with two disabled legs and walked towards the dagger he had driven into me. Behind me, I could hear him desperately crawling towards it even as I kicked it to the other side of the tent. I made my way to my weapon-rack and grabbed my spear before turning on the boy. My face was red as I yelled 'Why, Solo! Why did you make me do this!? I don't want to hurt you, I've never wanted to hurt you!'\n\nThe look of hatred that met my eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. It was as if I were staring not at another living being, but an angry ghost. 'You killed my father... You destroyed my home... You train me to destroy the homes of others... And you want me to be grateful? I am but the first, you will not survive this night-' In a single fluid motion, I slashed the tip of the spear over his neck and silenced him.\n\n A moment of horrible quiet passed, before a frantic lieutenant burst into the room. 'Commander! We're under attack! It's the- Commander you're wounded! And the boy-"

 flavour_tiboktsamo.6.t:0 "Aftermath of the Prank"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.6.d:0 "A sense of unease and dread hung over the batallion, as they walked through yet another empty village. The fighting had stopped weeks ago, yet still we found village after village completely devoid of life. The campaign had been bloody, and there had been more than a few villages burned to the ground, but these were not emptied by any soldier of the Tower...\n\n'Still no sign of what caused this, Tower Commander.' One of my scouts reported, before a sudden creaking broke the silence. Instantly, spears were pointed in the direction of the noise. From one of the seemingly emptied houses, a small figure emerged. I held up a hand to signal my men to hold as I took a few tentative steps closer. Then, in a sudden rush, the figure bolted towards me and embraced me even as I drew a dagger and prepared to strike. Moments before my knife would have found their neck, I realized... They were hugging me.\n\n'Please, please, please, don't let it take me.' The little girl sobbed. Dropping my dagger with a limp thud, began to gently pat the child's back.\n\n'I won't, whatever took them, will not take you... I promise.' I said, gently stroking her hair.\n\n'It was Eloko... Eloko ate them.' The girl said, looking up at me. It was only then I realized she was human, her features far too young for a halfling of her size. For a moment, I tensed. The only times I'd ever been this close to a human were when I'd been fighting them. 'Thank you for saving me.' The child said, between sobs, burying her head back into my chest.\n\n I stood there, stiff and awkward, before turning to one of my bewildered soldiers. 'Have a warm meal prepared, and tell the scouts to broaden their searches to seek more survivors.'\n\n'And... What is to be done with the survivors we find?' The soldier asked.\n\n'Bring them to the coast, and have them aid the Latranoma reconstruction project.'"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.6.a:0 "And... Tell the other soldiers to ignore any mention of 'Eloko' from refugees. They're clearly traumatized, and know not what they say."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.7.t:0 "A Late Night Visit"
 flavour_tiboktsamo.7.d:0 "I felt a dull ache in my side. It hadn't left me, not since I'd... I had been betrayed. It was his fault, not mine. Public records had been edited to remove any mentions of The Boy. Only my own memories remain of him. Laying there, dead on the ground... By my hand.\n\nThere was no cure for this ache, but work made it easier to forget. Paperwork that I'd once sought to escape was now my refuge, and on most nights I found myself finding more comfort in work than in sleep. It was one such night, as I was drafting plans for a new shrine, that I heard a knock on my office door. 'Come in' I said, without thinking.\n\nThe creature that entered looked like a Halfling, but I did not recognize it as a member of my guard. It smacked it's lips noisily, as it sucked clean bloodied fingers. My wargear was out of reach, but my hand instantly found a letter opener as I wordlessly stood and assumed a combat stance.\n\n'Hold, friend! You've nothing to fear from me, I've already eaten.' The creature said, smacking it's belly several times for emphasis.\n\n'Who are you. What do you want?' I asked, maintaining my stance.\n\n'Want? Why to thank you, of course! You've given me my greatest feast in centuries!' It said, grin widening to impossible extents. 'As for who I am, well I'd tell you but I believe you penned a law criminalizing the use of my name!'\n\nMy eyes widened for but a moment, before narrowing. 'Eloko.'\n\n'Funny how the one who makes the rules gets to break the rules!' The creature laughed, adding 'You've got to be careful with that anti-halfling rhetoric! Though if there were anyone I'd want associated with me, it'd be you. You haven't quite reached my body-count, but you're doing quite well for a mortal.'\n\n'Come closer and I may add you to my count, and render you the fairytale you 'ought to have been.' I spat, tensing.\n\n'Oh, how rich. The Kolovadoy speaks to me of fairytales.' The creature's laughter echoed throughout the room, as I hurtled the letter opener directly at its head. In a puff of mist, it vanished. Each candle illuminating my office extinguished in a moment, as its laughter echoed for a few seconds longer...\n\nThree guards would be reported missing, following that night. I returned to my drafts, more driven than ever. To acknowledge this creature now would be a sign of weakness, but there were subtler ways of dealing with it. A shrine to the goddess of tricksters, one surely greater than this monster..."

'I refuse the challenge.'\n\nBaffled, I asked 'you traveled all this way just to refuse?'\n\n'Kolo is Turozi's brother. You are Kolo's Champion, as I am Turozi's. One must show their family courtesy, no matter how inconvenient.' He said, before giving me a skeptical once-over. 'And that courtesy is why I now refuse. You are young, boy. Too few scars, you have not seen battle or war. Were we to duel now, there would be no honor in defeating you. No closure.'\n\nMy face flushed red as he spoke, before I regained my composure. 'So, then, you will accept a duel for honor... After I have proven myself in battle?' I asked, through gritted teeth.\n\nHe nodded. 'Yes. If you should prove yourself worthy to face the champion of the god of war, I shall accept. Then, when I defeat you, all shall know that Kolo's day has passed. That Lel remains head of the family, with fiery Turozi by her side.'"

 flavour_tiboktsamo.9.d:0 "I had spent most of my life fighting. Fighting to reclaim the Ananoma. Fighting to prove myself worthy to be Kolovadoy. Fighting was... What I was good at. But it had been years since I'd enjoyed it... This was different.\nBlock, parry, riposte. Block, parry, riposte.\n\nIt was like we were dancing, he and I. Kolo's and Turozi's champions. Our smiles gleamed as trickles of blood merged with sweat. Neither of us were unscathed, yet no winner could be declared. Across from me, I saw a brother I had never known. Not one of blood, but of spirit. I felt more alive now, in this fight, than I had in years. I felt like the Kolovadoy.\n\nThe fight started at noon. I was told later that it lasted nearly an hour. At some point, we'd each discarded our spears and shields and moved first to knives and then to punches and kicks. It all became a bit of a blur, apparently the fighting became so fierce that Turozi's champion had bit a chunk out of my shoulder. I was too high off of the excitement, to feel the pain as my wounds were sutured.\n\nBut then that was it. Turozi's champion, after he regained consciousness, conceded to my victory. Kolo's honor had been defended, and the happenings of this world surely reflected those of the divine. Yet... Victory did not taste as sweet as the fight had.\n\n'They tell me you are leaving, returning to Turozi's temple on the island.' I said, as I sat next to the champion's bed.\n\n'As soon as the healers say I am fit to travel. You broke 3 of my ribs, brother.' He said, with a somewhat pained laugh. My expression was pained as well... I thought for a long moment."

 flavour_tiboktsamo.10.d:0 "'And this spire... You insist it was built by your ancestors?' I ask, chin cupped in a hand as I stare at the immense pillar. From behind me, there is a slithering sound as a serpentine form moves beside me. I've been told it is a great honor to be in the presence of a naga, especially as a scaleless one. As of yet, I'm unconvinced.\n\n'Yes, a Zatsarya, one of nine. This one is known as Kazakesh, according to our own records.' The naga, Sozyr, nods emphatically. A somewhat comical gesture, for a creature of its proportions. 'There are those among the faithful Anzalkatsa who would see your people's presence here as a blasphemy.' Sozyr continued, gauging my reaction with cold reptilian eyes.\n\n'But I am not one of them. I have seen the lizardfolk of the isles, Itayzemby as you call them, and they are not made lesser by living amongst your people. Our kind are not so different, both seeking to reclaim what is lost. As I see it, the Halflings of Torapinoma and the Lizardfolk of Kazakesh were once friends. I should like to see that friendship renewed, and I should like a guarantee of safe passage for Anzalkatsa pilgrims seeking to gaze upon the Zatsarya.' Sozyr said, his final words more a proclomation that a request.\n\nI considered this for several moments. 'My own researchers have come to similar conclusions, in this place. But we have also discovered many disconcerting truths in Vadronoma. There was no friendship between us there. How am I to trust that you are truly like our old friends in Torapinoma, when you come from lands so much closer to the enemies of Vadronoma.' I asked, and for the first time noticed a crack in Sozyr's demeanor. They seemed to tense, almost as if afraid. Perhaps of me. Perhaps of failing their masters.\n\nTheir unease vanished quickly, and in an even tone they countered 'Because, if we work together, we can make it so. Our history may inform our future, but it is our choices now that decide which path of history to follow.'"

 flavour_tiboktsamo.11.d:0 "With a quiet incantation, the Mihipha ignite the flame. Blue light spills over the room, casting ominous shadows over the chained figures hunched over pillows. The shadows belong to the Ilitray, or at least as many as could be captured alive, the guiding council of Rayafo. So called philosophers and wisemen, now brought to bear witness to true wisdom.\n\n'As Kolo's champion, I shall take the role of speaker on his behalf.' I declared, a choked sob coming from one of the nearby Ilitray. Within Nakintas temple, we'd gathered 300 prisoners of war to witness this 'True Discussion' as the Rayafosi called it. A self aggrandizing ritual with which they claimed to speak to the gods. 'The first topic of discussion. Who is the greatest of the gods?'\n\nIn turn, each of the captured Ilitray answered. 'Kolo, father of us all.' This would be their easiest answer.\n\n'And who am I, who has reclaimed Kolo's temple?' I asked.\n\nHesitation was met with reprisal by nearby guards, and each Ilitray eventually answered 'You. You are the Kolovadoy.'\n\n'And why has Kolo's wrath fallen upon the people of Rayafo?' I asked.\n\nFinally, their answers diverged. 'Because we fled Saikinoma, as cowards.' 'Because we doubted Kolo's champion.' 'Because we have lost our way.'\n\nEach of these answers was acceptable. 'We stand, now, in the shrine of Nakinta. The World Shaper, he who built the earth on which we stand. Do those who have angered Kolo deserve such a shrine?'\n\nThere were gasps of horror from the crowd, but perhaps there was some truth to the Rayafosi belief this ritual granted heavenly wisdom. For they answered correctly, if reluctantly. 'No, they do not.'"

The watch of the Southern Tower may not have ended, but as the nation grows it becomes clear we can no longer rule from the island outpost. With the rebirth of Kolonama, so too shall our nation be reborn in it's old capital.\n\nNo Tower Commander has ever been in the position I am in now. Haingo Oldstone, who once spoke against my elevation to this role, had passed of old age. On his deathbed, he had spoken of being glad to have lived to see the True Kolovadoy. His successor was a fawning sycophant who, I believe, would support me even if I were to propose casting The Tower itself into the sea. Naka, once a snake in the grass, would now sooner hide under a rock than challenge me. The Council has become vestigial. My power is absolute.\n\nBut the question remains of what to do with that power. In olden days, Tiboktsamo was ruled by the Jakatany of Kolonama. I could, once again, restore that rulership... But the Jakatany failed, betrayed their nation, and fled. The council of the tower, decrepit as it has grown, never faltered. Perhaps it should be remade. Or perhaps it should die singing my glories, as Haingo did."

That's the part they don't tell you about living for a cause. It eats up every other part of your life, and when that cause is gone you realize there's nothing left.\n\nThe Ananoma are reclaimed and restored, the prophecy is fulfilled. My people are happy, our harvests bountiful, our prayers to Kolo seemingly answered. My purpose is complete, and yet I still live.\n\nI no longer know my people, and they do not know me. I don't know when it happened... Perhaps it was when the Ghost Halflings united with the Kaino and Jiromji. It was hatred of me that brought them together, a hatred I had failed to see. Perhaps, it was the moment I was first chosen. When my comrades became followers.\n\nI am an old man now, yet still I look to you for wisdom. Andrianary Longwatch, Tower Commander... Father.
