The Valefort remained despite it all, and if we had not been restored they might have been the last remnant of Farrani ways. Let them have their pride of place restored at court and bring their expertise back to the realm renewed."

Adventurers we may have been, but this realm has been given back to its people and to that end we owe it to the future generations of Farrani to make sure the kingdom is strong enough for it to be seen as a true continuation, with the Greentide as an unfortunate interregnum. But such recognition requires strength, and we must acquire it in spades."

The one about hearts and minds and us working to build an understanding that what will follow between our peoples is peace and a new beginning. For one thing is certain, that the Treaty of Anbenncost called for the unity of the Vale under one authority. Many in Ibevar still dream of this and many in Farraneán see too the promise that uniting realms can bring. As we are to make amends and build new ties between our realms, to do so must invite us to truly embrace the ambition of many Ibevari for that drive sets them apart from the more tranquil Elfrealms. We shall all step forward together, and in time prove to those restless now in Ibevar that they shall be treated properly and see their own dreams flourish with ours as we work to prove that working in unison shall benefit them just as much as we."

 farranean_the_place_of_munas_desc:0 "Munas Moonsinger was the one who guided the elves to Cannor, for he sang surprisingly enough to the Moon and the Dame answered back to give the elves a port of call. They came into a continent beset by war and it was their efforts to destroy Black Castanor that allowed the birth of Farraneán, Ibevar and indeed the Empire of Anbennar where they first landed. The Ibevari Reformation saw veneration of him rise to new heights, Corin’s recent accession reminds us that mortality is also divine and so it seems time to open up his veneration and make his worship more open to people of all species even if elves shall retain priority in clerical selections and nominations."

 farranean_inheriting_old_claims_desc:0 "The old Ibevar claims will require conflict with the Empire of Anbennar to be fulfilled in full, and such is true of ending the Orda Aldresias fortresses in Rotwall that have guarded against Corvurian aggression. Internal peace has come a little to Ibevar and they are beginning to see themselves as Ibevari and Farrani, but the hour harkens for us to show that this also extends to people in these lands coming to see themselves as Ibevari as a regional identity rather than an ethnic marker of elvishness. But this means there is no place for the Aldresians as a cultural marker, we respect all their knights have done but it is time for their service to end and for full sovereignty to be returned to what treaties owe. Their place is a happy retirement and it's time we guide that path."

The Antirionn must be built and this mountain sanctum properly restored. While we shall maintain what is there and continue the palatial estates for those old in years we cannot allow such autonomy to be a place where those steeped in the past wallow and prevent change. Silent Repose had been a den of action for those still following the old ways of the Elven Forebears religion and we cannot let it be a stronghold for those who would remain Ibevari and Ibevari only."

They shall all be empowered, and by doing so shall also be prevented from accumulating total power in any one of them as the traditional four estates also contend with the empowered status of the Adventurers given their role in this resurrection.

It’s a project of decades, perhaps even centuries and it begins with our need to work with the elves and our nobility who often represent those most attached to tradition so that even this project is seen as within the purview of their thinking.

The threat from Corvuria shall be watched against by Farraneán and the place of the Aldresians shall be given to all from now on. The Síl na Eáns sent many children to train at the Orda and so even as recent differences of opinion may have ended this way it remains true that we wish good relations with them regardless of their temporal authority. Galinda and Reanna Síl na Eán broke the order to remind it of its purpose and forge the Sword Covenant and it is that character that we seek to be true to.

Many are even seeing how a slow and steady increase in the number of half-elves within their borders means that their existing preferences and our success in convincing many Ibevari elves allows for this to happen and to be done at the initiative of those within the Elfrealm’s bureaucracy. It is both a joyous day but also a sad one to see the end of a nation's history, even on celebratory terms such as these. Our efforts have done this for us, but it has been the result of diplomacy and so it is with that tact that Ibevar will be celebrated even as it ceases to be."

Our system with parliamentary laws and debate has produced a final principality upon Halann that is most worthy. Our land is one where those souls who pass into the beyond into the celestial realms can barely feel the difference, such is our liberality and the bounties of the earth that we have provisioned for.

The Síl na Eán were not among the Silver Families descended from heroes, but their prestige came from their continued marriage that ensured the main lain remained half-elves in full, just as their people came to become.

Some even wonder if our charting of a new way for the whole vale has contributed to its growth, some druids saying that as it was once a locus for wild magic that it has become a locus of divine magic with all the hopes and dreams that people pour into it as a vessel. One thing is for sure though and that is that all can see that our tree is breathtaking when in its presence even at this humble stage, for it might not be ostentatious but it brims with a shine that is borne of hope."

For the Vale and the Wood are as one in this regard, and just as with the Elves there shall be a union between the cultures of these lands that experience similar circumstances as we do.

They seek to redefine what it means to be Adenner or to mould people into feeling a belonging to the new adventurer kingdoms they declare upon the ashes of old. There may be chance for accommodation yet, but we must be proactive, passivity doomed the old order in Escann and Korgus’ retreat to Castonath doomed his ambitions when Corin still came to fell him, action is sometimes required."

This return isn’t just sentimental though and it brings with it a return to an economic cycle that has existed before and will exist again. The markets of Antiquity may not have truly survived the Day of Ashen Skies or the Dragonwake, but in the same way people are rebuilding a life for themselves and the instruments that allow such complicated systems to arise and build prosperity for all have returned in kind in the post-Greentide world here in Escann."

Their cultivation a product of Escann’s former chivalric values and their prized nature in the old Adenner kingdom. This has given rise to a strong culture of localism even amongst the returned with an idealisation of a rugged lifestyle that a horse helps to solve. But such times needn’t last, beyond the idealised past comes the modern demands of the state and so it is time to begin increasing the commonality of law and order with our authority upon the plains.

The last Queen of Cardest had cursed the land and more importantly her own people in her dying moments and it had been abandoned until Martin and Ibenion made it their respective homes. We have done well to remake it for suitable settlement, but it remains the case that we should reconnect with our older roots in this renewed Farraneán, to better understand how and why the old realm came to be.

The Crown represents the continuity and embodies our nation and the national story by giving all families a symbol that is relatable and yet aspirational. The estates our traditional values and those who have vested interests that should be represented even as we adapt, giving minorities a place where they need not fear tyranny from the majority.

And we mourn those who were lost along the way, whose lives were snuffed out, for the past itself? We don’t mourn that, because it is not a place we can never return to, but simple all the steps we took to bring us to now and which shaped the pathway so that we might see all the steps ahead.

The Síl na Eán made the fateful decision that they and as much of the armed forces as were willing would man the fortifications and take the fight to the still strong stragglers of the Greentide as refugees streamed through the kingdom and destroyed any chance for retaining a strong authority as lords and other local powers were unable to truly provide for those fleeing from further afield. The only option had been for everyone to flee and seek refuge further afield where even with the ongoing Lilac Wars that there was greater food supplies in the regions people would be fleeing to.\n\nThe army lost to Korgus and yet their loss caused a shift in his march to the fateful events at Rottenstep, such mercies did not revive the kingdom though and even without the formal establishing of an orcish clan on the bones of the old kingdom many came and ransacked the empty cities with the collapse of any organised resistance besides those who holed up in the Valefort.\n\nWhen we came back upon Escin much of what had made it a capital had been destroyed, the Scogtrin itself gone and so much left to rebuild. Even as the living grew to make it home, the ghosts of the past could be felt in how empty so many halls remained even as more and more people moved in. The undead may not be present in a literal sense, but the way in which it was left felt like a place home to many unresolved moments.\n\nYet there is hope, as we plant the restored sapling transferred from the Valefort, it springs eternal."

The one exception are our captains, who without the surviving Síl na Eán’s agreement have stepped in for a more permanent monarchy even as they pay tribute to the former dynasty via the decision related to what they shall take on for a dynastic name.\n\nThere comes a point where having saved Escann and having fought against Korgus and the remnants, having fought against other adventurers in the scramble that came with the aftermath that many feel they have done enough for one lifetime. Many have earned quite a wage to set themselves and their descendants up as part of the nobility if they desire and others still plan for their children to adventuring dynasties of their own.\n\nFor so many of the returning refugees who see this in action, it is an inspirational sight. The meetings of people who thought they might never see each other again and now a full restoration to what they once did if desired. Hope is kindled in all these places and for the survivors then there is a determination that being given a second chance like this might never come again.\n\nAs the old oaths are given and as lavish a ceremony as the state can afford takes place in Escin, then the new investiture of the restored order and the promises to work for all are said. Farraneán is back, it has been restored in full and it is all thanks to these adventurers from across Cannor who fought against an unspeakable evil and have now gone above and beyond to return power they once grasped.

They see it as an insult and a betrayal of what they allowed during the centuries and with the fall.\n\nChief among these issues is them playing host to Farrani elves, many of those within their borders now threaten to be a threat to their security should war arise and even without if they return to their old homes it would be a severe shake up to the economy that the elfrealm had kept afloat amidst all the recent crises.\n\nSomething has to give though, Ibevar blocks the path back to the Empire and their intransigence makes diplomacy with other states difficult when they harass our own embassies under the pretext of ensuring security in the realms we visit. For us to truly restore our legitimacy, it seems we might have to unite the Vale and advance the old ideas of unity.\n\nSome had argued for this from the beginning, but the majority of the council and chambers deferred and said no. That while we might dream of mending fences that we had to try and do so naturally first. Yet it seems that our hands are somewhat tied and so with the end of bringing about this old dream, just as Tederfremh became part of Farraneán, it seems time to begin that path for Ibevar too if they will not consent to sharing the Vale."

 flavour_farranean.6.d:0 "A strange marriage, that is how most people describe the new union between our two kingdoms of Farraneán and Ibevar. It certainly won’t be the easiest of arrangements but we embarked upon this path with a dream of a united Vale, of one where we can have the Ibevari themselves wish to be Farrani. To this end we must ensure that the people running the kingdom as our viceroys are loyal but we must also give them great latitude to ensure that genuine concerns of the Ibevari are brought to our attention.\n\nIt is also a little odd in many ways for the Elfrealm to still be governed as one, but be ruled in union with a half-elf. The overturning of Arbaran was more violent and the relationships in the Redglades and Moonhaven are more subject oriented than equal. So as we tread this new ground, our rulers will be spending a great deal of time meeting with their Ibevari lieutenants and those working to keep life going on as normal for the average denizen. This is the path to our acceptance, to continue and preserve their normality and to this end they shall have our full support. Little treacheries will have to be tolerated on the way as we work to show we are more than worthy of their continued support.\n\nFor the lifetimes of elves means many have seen the old Farraneán go, the new one rise and now this new union. Those elves and those who came from the old Farraneán into Ibevar shall be those we need to win over the most. Those who have seen less may come naturally, but it is those who have lived through it all we need to make appeals too. Doubly so as these elder elves have first hand knowledge that we can bring to ensuring the revival of our culture proceeds as smoothly as the revival of our realm politically.\n\nSomewhere in Ibevar, the first person may already have begun to see themselves as being Ibevari and Farrani both, and this is the pathway to lasting peace through common aspirations."

Such strength of heart it embodies comes from its commonality, that this tree in particular grew to be so much in this floral lineage is proof of how we all take our place as part of the great throng of life and yet will stand out all the same. In the same way as a person means nothing when looked at from a distance but means everything to somebody, so too does the Scogtrin mean so much to our people.\n\nIt inspires such hope and our nature has grown with it, watered by our success it grows with our recovery and it inspires further recovery in turn. People now travel from our across our realm and our subject and sister-realms to see for themselves the truth of the tree that adorns our banner and bask in the strange serenity of its presence and the absence of ostentatious magic compared to simple serenity.\n\nIt isn’t the progress of a thousand leagues in a day, but that of a league a day for a hundred years. The druids and other botanical experts working to keep the tree healthy just as all the court, the members of the chamber and those who serve in our armies all work to water the branches of our state. Renewal is an active process, a result and not a single event."

Greater than any past iterations, it stands as proof of our determination that the future is a place we shall claim and look towards in greater and greater fashion. Going forwards with this great and greater confidence then it seems only fair that our cities grow to be better than what came before.\n\nThe first Farraneán was a great realm and it is not a tragedy but a source of great pride that we have eclipsed its legacy such that going forwards this iteration shall be what comes to mind first in the histories when our story is told in full. The Scogtrin grows taller than it ever had before and our experts can see it in a locus of divine magic in both the druidic and traditional divine sense. All the belief that we have put into its revival have made it a wellspring of energy that it slowly releases back across our realm.\n\nWe still don’t fully understand this process but one of our most elderly elven druids believes it to be another incarnation of something she believes is innate to all trees, subtle and imperceptible at most times but there nonetheless. The subtle energising effect of the Scogtrin seems to be the same and it takes in the hopes and dreams that all the people in our capital and whole realm place in it and then bring that back out. This is why Farrani look out for each other."

 flavour_farranean.9.d:0 "It seems that day has finally come. Ibevar and Farraneán are one. That dream held in different ways since the beginning of the resettlement of the Vale has finally come to pass. That piece of light and dream of a unified nation, of a single law code and of one identity across all lines has come about all the way from that glimmer of an ideal that was so far from fruition.\n\nBut this light was nurtured, it was nurtured by the Ibevari who kept their claims active and so reinforced the idea of a unified vale, it was kept warm by the beating Farrani heart and our half-elven nature that embodied the unity of Cannor. It was an idea that the wandering Cardesti spoke of with their stories of old Cardest and that time before time and it was an idea allowed to flourish thanks to the old vigil held by the Orda Aldresia. All these things made it so that this piece of light became a ray that shone upon a land once left abandoned by the Greentide.\n\nThis ray shone upon our people and the whole vale, and these ideas of unity were further reflected as the adventurers who turned the tide turned over the reigns of administration back unto the people, the various refugees who only wished for their old hearths and were astonished by the humility to be given back the keys to the whole home.\n\nA home where the new dawn breaks and now the light shines through the whole building, that Forlorn Vale shared by us all. Shared no longer only by multiple competing interests but instead under an aegis that protects all. Let this golden ray just as the one on our flag be felt everytime our banner is seen, on the field and in diplomacy equally."

And yet even as the sky we all look upon is different in how it is felt, everyone looks up to it and sees that beautiful cerulean or the hues of the gentle dark of night and feels solace that others look up to it to. The freedom to be who they wish to be within Farraneán means that all our peoples look up the sky differently and yet all feel those unspoken bonds that the sky might be the same despite it all.\n\nThe sky seen from atop the Havoric mountains, looking up from a long day of meditation in ones twilight years in the Silent Repose and pondering the mysteries of life that others have not the same time to consider.\n\nThe skies of our cities, penetrated by the towering buildings that shape how much you can see unless from a rooftop, only certain constellations seen with that and the light obscuration, and yet that scarcity sees those constellations given greater meaning on account of that. A night sky that stands less alone than from the mountaintops.\n\nThe skies from the countryside, the rolling hills being all that stops you from seeing the entire world as it fades into the horizon on the flat plains and the trees that break it up in the forests. A sky that is quiet and yet peppered by the staccato of bird chirping and various natural creatures going about their own lives with nary a care for the politicking of humanoids.\n\nAnd the sky as seen from the battlefield, the last sight seen by too many of those called upon who give their lives. Those who we owe so much to and yet can never repay enough. The sky as it fades from view slowly or the sudden void as a quick death finds you in the ranks. A sky of sadness and of courage. The tenacity felt by those who survive to ensure that such sacrifices go not in vain.\n\nFarraneán is host to all these skies, all Farrani. Distinct and united."

Of course no empire or dominion ever comes about by accident but it still must be said that we have never wished to be a world spanning empire as those who build colonies across Aelantir, Sarhal and Insyaa wish.\n\nThose great conquerors out of Haless and Bulwar may bring the bloody wealth of conquest, but in Farraneán we see that we have a bounty in this untapped vale so cultivated by civilisations and generations past. It is a land with dreams that we have inherited and which we shall pass down to those to come after.\n\nThis continuation of such a little dream is still worth doing though as we have to maintain our optimism and work to advance it actively. Any energy spent advancing this agenda could never be wasted effort.\n\nActing to preserve the small things is just as much a priority of this government as all the larger concerns.

The clergyman who sees all the caskets return and gives the last rites for the departed and the meagre few nobles who get to say they won at the end.\n\nThis was the kind of dispute that rocked the Vale, it and so many others that threaten the boring everyday peace that so many people would live if only they had more of it. We chose to confront this, to enforce a personal union over the old Elfrealm and this still brought bloodshed but it ended centuries of enmity in the vale.\n\nWe can’t bring peace to Halann, but we have done what many thought was impossible in mending a Forlorn Vale and bringing its people together when ancient rivalries might once have festered again for future generations.\n\nFor ourselves we have shown that there is another path even when it might seem impossible, and for all of Escann there may be a new path once more. The inexorable advance of fate continues on, but all can take solace in how wrongs can be righted. How a land once forgotten and living only in exile can be restored to its people, its symbol regrown and its people renewed."
