Magic is a door in the city of lost things, a worn epitaph commemorating forgotten legends. But it need not be so.

 #Radiant Events
 magic_project_infrastructure.100.t:0 "Cracks in the Tower"
 magic_project_infrastructure.100.d:0 "While seeking to improve their main source of magical power, our court mages discovered that the shoddy construction of the previous builders has lead to a series of tiny cracks spreading throughout the foundation of the mage tower. Due to the increase in magical output that we plan for the structure, leaving these cracks unattended could cause some damage to the tower in the long term. We could repair the cracks, but doing so would take time and cause the refurbishment to be delayed."

 magic_project_infrastructure.101.t:0 "Overflowing Ley Line"
 magic_project_infrastructure.101.d:0 "Ley lines, a type of field magic that strengthens spells cast within their boundaries, provide good locations for the construction of mage towers. But like many of the aspects of the art, ley lines are fickle and wont to cause conflict and frustration at uncertain times. Currently, the site of a future mage tower has become affected by a shift in the ley lines, causing the brickwork of the structure to begin to emit a faint azure light. This surge in the power of the ley lines could prove useful to spellcasting within the region, as ley lines are used in a wide variety of different magical traditions. Alternatively, it might behoove us to direct this power towards more immediate concerns."

 magic_project_infrastructure.102.d:0 "Wards are a keystone to magical defenses, serving as the first and last line of defense in both mundane and magical warfare. Improving the quality of the wards on our castles and towers is seen as a critical reason to expand our magical prowess, but repeated casting of warding magic on these structures will only serve to weaken them with time, concealing important structural failures better repaired through mundane means. A ruined structure held up by magic alone will see its wards will fade and become ineffective much faster than desired.\n\nThis moment in our nation's history provides a rare opportunity to pause and reconsider, as allowing some of these castle wards to temporarily fail will allow us to rebuild their walls and reinvigorate their wards with new techniques. However, failing to maintain our network of protective magic will leave us vulnerable to future attacks."

As insults are hurled left and right and the audience chamber is showered with multicoloured sparks, the mages shout their demands for a new school to be built, each favouring his own magical practice. After more rounds of spellslinging, animal summoning, and charm-enforced silent treatments, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finally steps in and ends the debate before someone is turned into a chicken. Stepping forward, [Root.Monarch.GetName] declares a new school will be built for one practice only…"

 magic_project_infrastructure.104.d:0 "Magecraft is becoming more intertwined with governance as the aristocracy increasingly shows magical aptitude. With the rise of magical administrators such as [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], non-mage government officials have gathered together and begun rallying against mages who serve a role in the administration of [Root.GetName]. Taking advantage of the recent reforms around magical practice in the country, they argue that one of these reforms should be the the cessation of magical power from the factors which qualify a candidate for title, lest mages establish an eternal magical dynasty!\n\nTensions have risen as [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] and the non-mages continue to argue, and this debate—ultimately pointless bickering for political power—now threatens to destabilize the whole project of magical reform! It is clear that the issue is now too large for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to ignore. In order to avoid a civil catastrophe, a side must be chosen."

 magic_project_infrastructure.105.t:0 "Magical Trade"
 magic_project_infrastructure.105.d:0 "Trade is a vital lifeline to the future of [Root.GetName], and this is no less true when it comes to magical aptitude. As mages begin to operate more frequently in the dockyards and markets of [Root.GetName], the role of their powers in the economy has come into question.\n\nMagecraft is capable of truly remarkable feats when it comes to moving goods, such as manipulating the wind to allow for swifter trade fleets and summoning familiars to move product through a market square. But magic can also cause distortions in the market, most notably seen when transmutation mages begin to rapidly flood the market with produce. The growing disparity between producers with access to magic and those without has caused uncompetitive practices to skyrocket, leading to a potential economic crisis. The question of how mages should be integrated into economic practice is left up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide."

 magic_project_infrastructure.106.d:0 "As with all tools, the use of magic in war has a long and storied history, with countless war magicks being created and utilized to ensure military victory in an unending number of campaigns. However, with the rise of magecraft in the state, the generals in our armies have begun to imagine a score of new possibilities in terms of war magic, far beyond the wildest dreams of what was considered possible before magic became more widespread.\n\nSwords wreathed in magical flame, unending in their fiery splendor. Cannon shot reinforced with wards that detonate when impacting a target. Cavalrymen with the speed of the wind, lightning fast in sorties and skirmishes. Our commanders dream of this and more, but other voices in the army warn of dark powers latent within magic. Spells of mass destruction, environmental warfare, and necromancy all dance within the lips of the skeptics, each more sinister than the last. However, skeptics warn that if mages are accepted into wider military roles then soon our nation will be nothing but warmongers and magical supremacists."

 magic_project_infrastructure.107.d:0 "The reinforcement of magical infrastructure has progressed well enough with our current tools, but recently progress has become increasingly difficult. Magic is temperamental, and trying to shape it without the proper tools is both cumbersome and dangerous. The mages in the court have made themselves clear; in order to proceed, magical artifacts designed to channel latent mana must be created, discovered, or both. These artifacts do not come cheap, and are closely guarded treasures by any who hold them. Getting one is difficult, getting enough to outfit a whole estate will be daunting. But if we do not, we face a delay which will set us back months of progress."

 magic_project_infrastructure.108.t:0 "Outlaw Mages"
 magic_project_infrastructure.108.d:0 "The expansion of magical networks throughout [Root.GetName] has allowed for magic to become more accessible to those within the nobility and lower class alike. This in turn has made it easier for those who hold ill intentions to sneak into mage towers and guild halls to steal powerful artifacts they do not understand, or access old spellbooks which give them power they cannot control. Security of these items is important to ensure that they cannot be used by those who mean to cause harm, but restriction of these resources will cause progress in improving the infrastructure to be delayed as access becomes more difficult."
 magic_project_infrastructure.108.a:0 "Progress must come with security."
 magic_project_infrastructure.108.b:0 "We must work towards a future where even the outlaws will be well-educated!"

 magic_project_infrastructure.109.t:0 "Damestear Drought"
 magic_project_infrastructure.109.d:0 "Magic is fickle, and the superstitious say it punishes more than it gives--the price is larger than the prize. Such a price has today arrived in [Root.GetName], as the magical energy usually found within the land has been noticeably drained. Court mages report that their own spellcasting abilities had been dampened by the constant need to use spells in assistance with constructing towers and other magical buildings. In order to counteract this effect, large supplies of damestear must be acquired at great cost. Or the [Root.GetMagesName] could push on in their construction efforts, but this could lead to further issues, cascading into one another like dominos."
 magical_infrastructure_magical_consequences:0 "Magical Consequences!"

 magic_project_infrastructure.110.t:0 "The [Root.GetMagesName] and the [Root.GetClergyName]"
 magic_project_infrastructure.110.d:0 "The [Root.GetMagesName] have taken to asserting their increasingly important position within the [Root.GovernmentName] by claiming to speak on wider and wider matters, including that of the divine. Outrated, the [Root.GetClergyName] have responded by arguing for their right to speak on matters of magic. The argument stems from the existence of divine magic giving the [Root.GetClergyName] a legitimate claim to being mages themselves, which either means that the [Root.GetMagesName] have authority over the divine or that the [Root.GetClergyName] have authority over the magical.\n\nWe might seek to grant the [Root.GetClergyName] dominion over the [Root.GetMagesName], but the infighting that would ensue could prove to be enormous. Alternatively, the [Root.GetClergyName] can be removed from any decisions pertaining to magical infrastructure, at the risk of their anger."
 magic_project_infrastructure.110.a:0 "The time is right for the [Root.GetClergyName] to take precedence."
 magic_project_infrastructure.110.b:0 "The [Root.GetMagesName] are a keystone institution in our nation, and must remain empowered!"

 magic_project_infrastructure.111.t:0 "Magical Roads and Bridges"
 magic_project_infrastructure.111.d:0 "Magic has begun to infuse every aspect of industry within [Root.GetName], including the very roads on which the people walk upon. Veins of damestear shoot throughout the cobblestones, lining the streets with a soft cerulean glow as they snake throughout [Root.Capital.GetName] like the fingers of a lightning bolt. The [Root.GetMagesName] wish to extend this road network throughout the land, stitching together our land with latent mana like a spiderweb of potential energy. This expansion would greatly assist the infrastructure projects planned within [Root.GetName], but would be expensive to create to the extent the [Root.GetMagesName] desire."
 magic_project_infrastructure.111.a:0 "Damestear in the streets? A bit rich for my tastes!"
 magic_project_infrastructure.111.b:0 "We must seize this opportunity!"

 magic_project_infrastructure.112.t:0 "Magical Scandal"
 magic_project_infrastructure.112.d:0 "As magic continues to advance within [Root.GetName], the activity of [Root.Capital.GetName] becomes more and more inscrutable to a normal citizen with each passing day. However, even with the ability to create matter from nothing and level entire cities with a thought, one cannot escape from the human urge to lie. This urge has struck [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], who has been caught hoarding stockpiles of damestear for personal use. Caches of damestear such as the ones currently being squirreled away by the magical elite are of great importance to our larger project, and their hoarding in this fashion is tantamount to treason... or at least piracy and malversation. The caches could be confiscated and the mages punished accordingly, but this would anger the rest of the court and cause tensions between the magical and the mundane to increase."
 magic_project_infrastructure.112.a:0 "We have no choice but to bury the report"
 magic_project_infrastructure.112.b:0 "Fire [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] and seize [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] assets!"

 magic_project_infrastructure.113.t:0 "Unregulated Advancement: Citizen Outcry"

An outspoken proponent of anti-magic doctrine has caught wind of the scandal, and has threatened to release the information to the public and bring the truth of our perceived crimes to light.

Magic is a fact of life for our citizens, and those who cannot engage in such a critical element of our very being must be removed. Replacing those in court was easy enough, but pushback from local leaders and other figures of power has been fierce. They claim that their removal from their posts is a sign of totalitarian oppression, and that we seek to dominate all aspects of the daily lives of non-magical peons. A ridiculous suggestion, but one that speaks to the hearts of the lowly dissenters who follow them.\n\nNow roving bands of rebellious "marauders" have begun terrorizing magical projects, rendering them unusable under cover of darkness and encouraging the workers to cease operations.

A city for normal folk—a city as mundane as them. But that will change. One day. There will come a time when [Root.Capital.GetName] is anything but ordinary. It will be a cathedral of Abjuration magic, a grand edifice of the arcane. You have imagined it as so, and you have mobilized the [Root.GetMagesName] in response.\n\nThe plans have been drawn up; but plans are just ideas on paper—a dream in your mind for what could be. But as a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it is your job to make your dreams manifest. And after all, a scroll is just magic scribbled to a page. It is the power of the practitioner, the honed, perfected practice of magecraft, which makes it real.\n\nIt all led you here, to today. At last, it is time to begin. Vast swaths of resources will doubtlessly need to be dedicated to the task. Towns on the periphery will need to be torn down, the land carved, and of course the logistics of transporting both material supplies and the magical equipment necessary to the task cannot be understated in their volume."

Increased production quotas in our quarries and mines. Increased lumber harvesting. Blacksmiths working around the clock. This fortress will of course be arcane in nature, but the basis of it will lie in the mundane. What comes after—that will be how we transcend the mundane.\n\nThe [Root.GetMagesName] act as architects and directors, sending the laborers here and there. Groups of apprentices work together to hover the large stone blocks and slabs into place, whilst other, more practiced Abjurers and Enchanters reinforce the material with magic. It’s all one big system—and it runs around the clock. \n\nMerchants, travelers, diplomats and the like have (inevitably) ventured past the fortress-hopeful’s grounds. Of course, they do not truly understand what it is… what it is going to be. Still, word has begun to spread. “Have you heard what they’re doing in [Root.Capital.GetName]?” Followed by some irreverent, rambling speculation on the nature of your project.\n\nThey can hazard a guess, but they could never picture its true grandeur in their mind's eye. And without that spectacle, they might as well be blind to the reality of what will one day occupy these grounds. Their minds are simply too small for a dream as big as the one dwelling within [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nBut you pay the thought of them little heed.

You roam the grounds, appearing as if in a trance, and take detailed notes of all that you see. You spend nearly two straight days doing this—for that is the scale of your masterpiece.\n\nThe castle has three outer layers—three separate walls that encompass the entirety of the grounds. Each is as well defended as the last, and each sport more towers and gatehouses, more easily defensible positions, and all manner of things in higher quantities than your courtesans could find anywhere else on Halann. The interior of the palace is another manner. It houses everything you could ever possibly need, and even what you couldn’t.

You have paid them for their time, but you must imagine that the real allure, the true pull as it were, is the chance to be a part of history.\n\nThey work together constructing spells, etching glyphs, outlining barriers and traps and magical battlements.

And you ponder if something as beautiful as this had ever been created before: in all of Halann’s history, had such genius ever borne a fruit like this?\n\nShe gleams with translucent walls like solidified light, pulsing faintly with arcane runes that shift and realign like gears in an invisible mechanism. Each tower is a lattice of force fields, radiating magical energy in hues of sapphire, periwinkle, and pearl. Slits for mages, artillery, and guns hover unsupported in midair, suspended in Abjuration fields that ripple like water when touched, only to spring back into form. The ground around crackles with a force akin to static, making it clear that no hostile spell could take root within a hundred paces.\n\nBut you didn’t stop there. Your twenty-four layered Abjuration barriers were far from enough. No, within each wall—three mana generators. In the gaps between, dozens of conjured ghosts and spirits roam like guard dogs. Across the premises lay thousands of traps, and parts of hallways that suck assailants into self-destructing (and regenerating) demiplanes.\n\nThe finish line is in sight, and you will make sure you witness every moment of it. You will stand and watch as every binding is cast, as every spell is carefully tallied.

Countless souls may die at the gates of this illustrious bastion, but it will never win you wars. In a way, it’s much like a spell—not an Abjuration spell, though. No, an Enchantment. The existence of this castle is a spell in the minds of all, a proverb for doing the impossible, and in more ways than one: for the simple fact that it exists is proof that maddening dreams can manifest into the real world.

Never anywhere in between, for even the smallest of sexual indiscretions by ministers are treated as state-destroying secrets.\n\nStill, the curses and promised banes upon the contract for disclosure were somewhat harsher than usual, and the request odd considering my expertise. To decipher the notes of a missing researcher, evidently a madman who babbled of psychography and existence before the womb. I felt a strange aspect upon his journal, a certain ill wind as though it had entered my abode uninvited. Yet too polite to reject the guest, and thinking the task too lucrative, I nonetheless accepted the offer."

When finally I understood, the horrifying details laid out were at once rejected from my mind for their violations of polite living, and I fled through the halls of the library, as though distance would shield my mind. Yet any rational existence cannot but accept accurate information that is provided to it. The vituperative writing carried with it an act of violence, akin to a well-reasoned scientific proof that, once heard, must be understood. And so I crept back to the desk, stupefied but resolute.\n\nThe conjurer summons from planes of known origin, guiding creatures and objects across safe paths--paths through what? A roiling mass of potential energy, known initially to the academic as the Astral Gloam. A sea of a thousand stars, an angry and chaotic mass with occasional islands of stability. What the dead professor had sought to do, by my compromised understanding of his texts, was to conjure from this sea itself, using a body as a vessel and an anchor. A permanent summoning, something hitherto unheard of--yet the only way such a thing could occur was through equal transposition, the exchange of bodies across a gate. The method of his disappearance, then, was thusly confirmed: he had been transported into the Astral Gloam, a body adrift in impossibility."

With this increase in understanding, a new task was assigned to me by those certain individuals who had hired me previously. A letter arrived outlining the necessity of a rescue operation--to retrieve the professor from the tenuous state of survival he no doubt found himself in currently. It came with promise of a stipend too large to refuse, and even personal favor with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself].\n\nI called in favors, expending the last of my purse on swarthy workmen and sturdy clothing. Not knowing what would await us upon replication of the rites described, I could only hope to keep myself from becoming the trade necessary to save the lost professor. I did not inform the others about the truth of our operations, thinking it the greater portion of my burden to keep silent on these matters. There was one more thought that came to me, as the one in the center of the circle was mesmerized into stupor. Logically speaking, there must be a reason for children to forget their earliest years. Something within the Roil that, if not forgotten, would leave them otherwise unfit for embodied existence. Before I could conclude my theory, blood started flowing from the blind-writer's wrist."

Over moderately good wine, we finest of our age gave vent to our wildest sallies on the nature of the ‘Gloam’ and – though we never quite said this – how it might be mastered. Over my cups I watched my companions come almost to the point of the boast that they, too, might undertake this ritual which had killed the only fellows to conduct it successfully. None did.\n\nSome ideas, once countenanced and fostered, must also be hoarded. One allows no tainting of the pearl; the notion balances perfectly in the mind’s eye, and one brooks no perturbation of the invisible field which – one perceives – surrounds and engulfs it. I brought the summoned constructs of the state before me, these strange spectral soldiers that my erstwhile colleagues had so bled to bring forth.\n\nThe constructs were unhelpful, of course.

Feet thunder down upon its slats as we cross, ropes swinging between a Here and a There; between, only Abyss. Our lives are the rotting wood slats which swing in the wind, the fraying rope. Yet we cling to our rotten rope, for we know with the certainty of childhood the utter terror of the endless, sourceless falling of non-being. We fear oblivion, imagining it insensate; we are wrong. She craves us. This is what I perceive, I who have crept closer to the Gloam than any other.\n\nA selfish mother, who for all of untime would gladly stroke and coo at her swollen belly: this is the Gloam. We Conjurers in our ritual circles imagine our great magics as a tugging, a fastening of ropes, a seizing of things beyond existence into existence; even in our self-flattery, we imagine ourselves brutally coercive. To conjure is to impose the will, to make ourselves heard in the cacophony of existence and demand that it dance for us.

Not a bridge but a tower, built at the heart of an immensity of void: a nothingness that nevertheless smothers, a guilt-bond, the savage possession of the birthing mother, the insistence that these naughty children with the audacity to exist had better come home before sundown, or so help me… the letter from mother ignored. But the letter will come; it shall be delivered, and so shall we. \n\nThe bridge is too kind a metaphor, you understand, too pleasant a truth. We do not pass from one place to another, risking only in our brief passage the danger of the Abyss, then falling into the arms of some friendly plane. The Abyssal Womb is the norm; all but one millionth of the vast, immense plurality of existence. We take refuge briefly in a great tower, a massive thing itself only a pinprick within an endless mother. The miracle of birth is but a prison-break, and for so short a time! She is so furious with us, but she will always accept us back. This is her horrible mercy, which denies the dead oblivion.\n\nThe smiles on the constructs have changed; no longer do they bear the mockery one reserves for the naif."

Slowly, the clouds recede, and the section of crystal in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] displays an image of the viewing complex at that exact moment in time. The diviners give the command, subtly adjust the flow of mana encoded into the sphere, and the image begins to move.\n\nThe viewport moves from the ground and climbs into the atmosphere, revealing the countless pylons that now cluster on nearly every inch of available land in [Root.Capital.GetName]. As time moves on, these pylons and the surrounding structures are tinted green as nature slowly reclaims the land, stalks and vines twisting around every surface. Towns and cities rise in the background, some growing into titans of industry, others reduced to rubble and screams. Borders change, armies march, and towers fall as a soot-black explosion rocks a nearby castle, spellcasters wailing in agony as they are pierced by pockets of nothingness.\n\nThe image shifts again, and displayed now is a grim fortress on a stark hill, the road to the gate lined with gibbets and gallows. Detractors hang from their necks or lie in iron cages as broken peasants walk below. Then again, the view changes–eldritch horrors, fearless commanders, monsters grown from nothingness. All this and more flashes within the sphere, until the image finally settles on a barren waste, devoid of life, and a giant ball of glass, half-covered by black sand.\n\nThe orb is quickly deactivated, and the diviners lock in the calibration parameters. They have seen what could be the end of all things, and how it may occur. [Root.GetName] may now prosper, as long as this path is avoided–and if our enemies stand prepared to break us, we will use our knowledge to break the world in kind."

 magic_project_battlemage_academy.4.outhouse:0 "The moon hung low over the quiet castle walls, trees gently swaying in the midnight breeze. Silence imposed its iron-fisted order over all, except for the barely concealed sniggering of two teenagers. One of them, a dark-haired and wild-eyed figure, gripped his wand like a dagger as the other, a mousy-faced and pouch-cheeked boy, scrambled to join him in the concealment of the bush. "It's ready," the latter whisper-shouted. "I scribbled it on the inside of the lid. Copied it direct from my textbook, I did." He looked almost proud of the fact that he couldn't properly memorize an evocation rune.\n\nThe dark-haired boy grinned. "You're brilliant.

Not even Mother saw, and she's got that divination orb what she uses to keep track of me."\n\nThen the two devolved once more into stifled giggles as the dark-haired boy pointed his wand over to the wooden building, casting the priming charm under his breath. "Okay, ten seconds. Don't look away now!"\n\nAt just that moment, a mage-light flickered on in the distance as the outhouse door creaked open. The boys' eyes widened. "Is that--" "Oh, no, I think it's--"\n\nThe dean's voice rang out in the still night air. "Oi! Who drew Flanagan's Ignition on the inside of this--" His voice was cut short by a loud bang, the ceiling of the outhouse flinging off its loose rafters."
 magic_project_battlemage_academy.4.graffiti:0 "Thump. Thump. Thump. The sound became persistent as the nights went on, keeping students and professors alike awake. Investigations into the source of the noises had repeatedly turned up empty-handed, as had the regular night patrols that now circled the whole of the academy from dusk till dawn. New and inventive punishments had been promised to the culprits when they were caught--not that anyone had difficulty deducing who they were. Their names were by now emblazoned on every single brick, every line of mortar, and every wooden door around the whole of the campus.\n\nNor were their methods entirely secret: by now, everyone had seen one of the many miniscule, self-replicating constructs that now inhabited the castle's walls. Having torn through much of the stone, they were now being regularly found inside of closets, residing inside of hats, scarves, and shoes. By day they rested, by night they ate of the campus's stone towers: creating more of their kind by carving lines that traced out the names of their creators.\n\nThe work had so destabilized the castle that the uppermost donjons had to be abandoned by their usual inhabitants. Any mundane blasting efforts had been called off for fear of further destabilizing the castle, and magical exorcisms were denied flatly on the basis of doing harm to the school spirit, who inhabited the same bricks and mortar as the constructs. The dean had no choice but to call a specialist--and in the meantime, search for the guilty parties who had so shamed the academy. Meanwhile, two boys peered gleefully in on the whole mess from their hideout in the woods, where they had stashed more than enough supplies to wait until the whole thing blew over."

The dean's usually calm demeanor had taken on a somewhat strawberry tone, the pale red pallor of exertion performed by someone who was unused to the feat. It wasn't enough that his underwear had been stolen--left drawer, under the robes, monogrammed and embarrassingly purple--it was that his prize horse was now the one wearing them.\n\nWhat had begun that morning as various attempts at bribery, and escalated by noon to domination enchantments that were easily swatted away by the complex interweaving of the dean's own prior abjuration wards, had now ended in a full-blown chase down the halls of the storied battlemage academy. The dean huffing and puffing despite the Longstrider charms, his horse always a few steps ahead. Proud man that he was, the dean had insisted no one else lay a hand on his precious D'Alembert.\n\nThe horse whinnied, evidently enjoying the exercise, and shook his backside as though to show off the dean's underwear once more. Nearby, two boys laughed uproariously at the sight, speeding on the horse with a couple cantrips of their own. The dean stared daggers at the two as he ran past, but didn't pause to say a word."

Every inch of your body feels as though it is burning, freezing, and evaporating, all at once. But finally, the pain fades. And you are still standing.\n The next few days are quiet ones, spent assessing your new existence alone in your chambers. Your new body looks much like your old one, though you no longer feel the pangs of hunger or thirst, nor any other distracting mortal urge. Your flesh already hangs loosely from your bones due to the emaciation of your long cleansing. Given enough time, it will eventually slough away and leave only your polished skeleton behind. You will be a perfect being in body as well as in mind and soul."
 magic_project_lichdom.11.db:0 "Immarel Winterswrath has at last ascended to an eternal power - lichdom. Immortal, she can essentially rule Gemradcurt for all eternity. However, due to her rather unique path to achieving Lichdom, doing so off of the back of a very powerful Archfey patron, and using his esoteric designs for a phylactery and purging ritual, the nature of her ascension has been rather different to that of Morgurax, the first lich.\n\nHer phylactery, deep within the Frostspear, is completely immobile, unable to be moved from it's position without a great deal of effort - furthermore, it is essentially physically and magically connected to the spell-maelstrom that swirls high above the city, so that the "Heart of Winter" and the Eternal Winter that Gemradcurt has been cast into are intimately connected. While this means that Immarel's soul is potentially more susceptible to being discovered and destroyed, and the process of ascending to Lichdom infinitely more expensive than the traditional method, it has other, potentially greater benefits.\n\nThe greatest of these is that Immarel's soul can be "transferred" from one physical body to another, replacing the mind of the person whose body she inhabits, rendering the transferral subject braindead in the process, but most notably NOT killing the subject's physical body, as in the normal process. This allows her to keep a physical connection to the world around her - something that the Everfrost Prince seems to be rather keen on, likely so that Immarel too can feel the "cold embrace of winter". Transferral is difficult and time-consuming, and cannot be done on a whim, but nonetheless it can be done without too much fuss, allowing Immarel to change bodies once her old one gets too old or damaged to use. Physical differences in appearance can be covered up with illusion magic, much like Liches often do in the east. However, should Immarel's host body be killed physically, Immarel will be forcibly booted back to the Heart-Chamber beneath the Frostspear, and must first recover for a time before re-transferring to a new host body. While this method, and slightly unique form of Lichdom, is too bespoke and limited to be utilised anywhere else, it is nonetheless vital to the success of the Immarellian regime. Pray that Immarel uses the gift bestowed to her wisely..."
