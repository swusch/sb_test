Their milk is tasty. You're tired? They're strong enough to bring you home! You're feeling down? Everyone knows they have a certain, rabid cuteness to them! Even in death they remain helpful: their skin can clothe you, their steaks fill you, their bone claws and brittle-ivory teeth can bolster any magic ritual you might imagine.

 J78_legacy_of_vaokanur_desc:0 "For centuries, Vaokanur was the terror of the Lower Kalavend, masters of blood magic. Instead of uncountable slaves being thrown to the depths of Uesrennu, they were sacrificed to the city’s infamous blood-pits instead. When the Vaokanuri were finally scoured by one of their own, the high stone walls and bloody banners of Vaokanur were reduced to ruins – now due south of Uesrennu. Their legacy of dark power remains, however, and the Aryakompus have become very interested in it indeed. It is said the Blue House holds remnants of their knowledge – perhaps it is time to reach out, and see if there are others who share that interest?"

It took the resources of an Empire and hundreds of thousands of slaves to crack into the riches below ground, and now the mine-cities sprawl beneath the earth, pick and claw extracting the hidden mineral wealth of the foothills, eclipsing the towns above ground, now only useful for food and firewood. But the mines consume as many slaves as they take – and they hunger for more and more and more. Luckily for them, the Aryakompu are eager to provide."

Pity about its current inhabitants, arrogant drones resting on their ancestor’s laurels - a bunch of rats, without any of the qualities the kotakompu have. We'll correct this. For a long time the Aryakompu dynasty has eyed this city - but their desire is not like every other Taychendi ruler. In the depths of Nanru Nakar’s underwarren, they see in their mind’s eye a new center for the Kotakompu, outside the mines of the Katalmarai. The Queens shall rule in the underground just as the Kompu kings do on the surface – their example will teach the local population, and the haughty Mudaliars, the proper way to live."

While we breed swarms of Shavanamu (Warren) Kotakompu, the trainers of Varaendi breed the larger, hairier, tougher Avayirun (plains) Kotakompu in smaller number.\nAll sorts of kotakompu are worthy of our attention, none excluded. They're all part of our big family. We shall integrate the methods of Varaendi’s breeders into our nation, and crossbreed their war-kompu with our rodents. The swarm will grow larger and stronger!"

"New times require new ideas, and new people!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] continued. "This is the reason why I've decided to nominate a new heir, who will succeed me in governing our expanding realm.

After gazing fascinated at the kotakompu in the center of the feeding pack for a while, [Root.Monarch.GetName] commanded the closest servant to bring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heir here. How the rodent wrestled the best place to eat from the others, allowing him to get all the choicest pieces! [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would give this one to the heir as a pet and companion. There's more to learn from him than from any of those dusty tutors.\n\nThe bones of the ambassador made a sickly crunch every time one of the mole-rats took a bite out of them."

 uesrennu.1.d:0 "The slaves heave, the picks strike, the stones crack. “Work for ya’ lives!” The heat burns, the slaves heave, the sweat beads, the picks strike, the dust sticks, the stones crack. “Slack ‘n taste the bite!” The whip comes down, lash and heave and strike and cry and crack–! The mines of Uesrennu, spurred, drive on.\n\nBut it isn’t just the shackled and the slavers who fuel Uesrennu – fuel the mine-cities of the Katalmarai. For the slaves heave, the drivers cry, and the Kotakompu chatter and bite and dig and devour! Half-haired rat-beasts! The frame of a capybara, the fecundity of a mole-rat, the size and strength of a war-hound! Make a deal with a queen, offer meat, warmth, room to grow? You can take her spawn as your own.\n\nA trainer does just that in a queen-chamber in Uesrennu now, giving tribute, taking tax. Handlers, in Entislula and Caiyamkq and the off-tunnels of the capital-mine, spur their rats further into the rock, to search for metal and mineral both. And, of course, the slave-driver holds both whip and leash, to lash elves to their work and beasts to his side, and let-em-loose when terror calls!\n\nThe last point is new in Taychend. For a hundred years, the Gophiran Empire sent millions of slaves to claw into the Katalmarai, used sabre and steel alone to keep them there. They gave the Kotakompu trainers benefits – but not freedom. A mistake. Amidst the Death Throes of Gophira, the greatest rat-trainer of them all rose up as Varamzhil the Liberator. He tasted freedom’s light – but was thrust back into the dark.\n\nWhen he rose once more, he rose not as trainer nor liberator, but King of the Kompu! Dread-slaver, dead-devourer! The Copper-Born-Biter! A rodent horde at his back, the Kalavend at his mercy! A century, and now the Seventh Varamzhil, wearing the skins of his sickle-toothed brethren and the bones of his enemies, overlooks his underground domain; watches the countless slaves toiling away in his underground cities, the growing masses of war-kotakompu bred by the dark’s captive-queens, and smiles…"

 uesrennu.2.d:0 "The walls lay broken, shattered, the city inside now truly captives of their homes. The decision to surrender had been made the day before, notice given – one more night under a free sky, and they would surrender. The defenders despaired as they tucked their children to bed.\n\nUnder darkness, the King of the Kompu let ‘em loose.\n\nThousands, ten thousand maybe. More than the doomed city could handle. Grown over decades, multiplying still, against the stress of toil and battle. Left half-starved, the Kotakompu horde knew what to do – they surged over the breaks in the walls, under the river-gate, clawed through the ground itself. And then, they devoured.\n\nWhen dawn rose, the horde was contented. Their trainers and handlers and drivers collected them, put them back under leash as they dozed, gorged on elf-flesh, white sickle-teeth painted red. A full meal rarely gained, for their trainers fed them sparingly, out of strategy… and necessity. It was difficult enough to feed the kotakompu in the mines, but so many, out in the open? And then more for the queens, to replace the losses.\n\nThe swarm grows by the day – and if the Aryakompus do not throw them their meat? Satiate their hunger…?"

 uesrennu.3.t:0 "Death in the Mines"
 uesrennu.3.d:0 "Jopan couldn't feel his feet. He’d been grabbed in the middle of the night, inside his home, by a group of soldiers. Most of his townsmen had suffered the same fate, and by the dawning of the day his village had been thoroughly sacked. After they were done with that, the march began, seasoned by whippings and beatings. He had lost count of the days since, just as he lost sight of any known face. The sad parade kept swelling day by day with new victims and tormentors, the friends and acquaintances of a lifetime dispersed among a multitude of other desperates.\nThey were close to their destination it seemed; that afternoon they stopped the march early, and for the first time since forever, he was fed with enough food to call it a dinner. Maybe his suffering was near the end - or at least the worst of it was over.\n\nHe stared into the dark abyss below him. They were being lowered down into it - a small group of eight prisoners - deep inside the hill; side tunnels sprouted from the sides of the shaft. Noises could be heard from there, but never voices: only the sound of the pick striking stone, skittering noises from some of the tunnels. There was a stench of dead air.\n\n"New arrivals, grab one of the pickaxes and follow the tunnel to its end! Then dig like your lives depend on it. Because they do!" And so they went, he and his companions - not prisoners, no, but slaves. The air was irrespirable, the light a dim candle, and through cracks and holes in the tunnels’ walls, they could feel countless glowing eyes staring at them.\n\nJopan’s stomach dropped. That smell wasn’t just dead air, but dead elves… and soon, he knew, he would join them."
 uesrennu.3.d1:0 "Another week, another batch of slaves dragged to the mine. Tales of the mines had by now spread to all Taychend, so all these people already had an idea of what awaited them. They were dead elves walking, and their eyes, their body language fully looked the part.\n\n"The new batch of slaves arrived? Finally!" The warden’s stream of complaints didn't help. "The last big group went and got themselves killed in the tunnel collapse… Useless idiots, no matter how many times you tell them how to mine they don't learn! And I'll be the one paying the consequences of that! The higher ups are always asking for more gems and metals, but they don't put any effort in procuring the arms to do it.\n\n"Send these down, and send for more. What? Don't you know that the needs of the mine are paramount?" The darkness engulfed yet another group of elves."
 uesrennu.3.a:0 "Keep us informed on the mines progress."

 uesrennu.4.d:0 "A struck match in an off-tunnel, and darkness gave way to light. Five elves met – all slaves, but only one still in bondage, and one able to free him. The slave-priest held two hands up. One palm out, sabre-steel in the other – a rare sight, in the mines.\n“Do you still hold the fire of freedom within you?”\nKal remembered when his warmth came from the sun above, not the fires of the earth. “I do.”\n“Does the rage of righteous hatred still course through your blood?”\nKal remembered the first time he felt the bite of his chains, the first lash of the whip. His fist clenched, lips turned to scowl. “I do.”\n“And do you swear to carry that fire, that rage, within you? Until your last dying breath, or that of the last slaver to stain this world?”\nKal did not need to remember to answer - “I do!”\nThe slave-priest smiled. “Then hold out your hand, and shed your last blood as an unfree soul.”\n– – –\nThe King of the Kompu was playing with one of his companions when one of his lieutenants walked in. [Root.Monarch.GetName] only acknowledged him with a glance, before he turned back to his closer ally before him – he was teaching the war-kompu how to leap, tear throats.\n\n“Aryakompu,” the lieutenant began, a tremble in his voice. “There have been some troubling reports… miners going missing in the off-tunnels. Consistently. Its starting to become a drain…”\n\nThe Aryakompu laughed, as his lieutenant froze in fear. "Miners die all the time – they were probably fed to the swarm! You’re missing slaves? Get more!""

 uesrennu.5.t:0 "The Cult of Vherenar is on the Move"
 uesrennu.5.d:0 "Varamzhil I Aryakompu was not the only elf fighting for freedom amidst the Death Throes of Gophira. Taken captive in the subjugation of the great Larankarha Revolt, the Dyamari warrior Vherenar fought for the cause of liberty and the breaking of chains across Taychend, after he escaped bondage himself. But as Vherenar forged a secret society that would spread among the slaves of Taychend, and became in death the Freesword, Varamzhil betrayed the slaves he had once rose alongside, subjugated them with his rodent swarms, and became Aryakompu, the Copper-Born-Biter.\n\nAs Uesrennu’s armies and the terrors that accompany them have swept across Taychend, slaves and abused peasants alike have searched for relief and resistance – and in the Cult of Vherenar, they have found it. Organised into decentralised “cells” led by their Kavalali warrior-priests, the Cult has proved an elusive and tenacious thorn in the side of the Aryakompus, worship of Vherenar and the god-hero’s dream of liberty a pandemic sweeping the realm’s slave-stock.\n\nTime will tell if the swarms of Uesrennu, born in shadow, will one day be claimed by it."

 uesrennu.6.t:0 "Our Kotakompu Will Fit Right In"
 uesrennu.6.d:0 "A whole city moving. That's what it felt like these last few days.\nBecause months of siege weren't enough. Because the brutal sacking that followed wasn't enough. Because nights upon nights of abject terror, awake in fear of being taken away as "rebels" or "insurgents" by the new overlords' sickle-toothed minions wasn't enough.\n\nNo, the Aryakompu has a new brilliant idea to torment us with: entire neighborhoods, and the best part of the inhabited undercity will, from now on, be dedicated to housing his mangy beasts. The people living there? Us? Sent to other districts. Living where? Living how? The Kompu King does not care. We're not rats, after all. And anyone that refuses or tries to put up even the smallest act of resistance gets rounded up, like many others in the last weeks, and sent to their mines.\n\nBut no, we are not rats, and this tyrant will be made aware of this fact in due time. Not today, perhaps - most people's spirits are too broken right now. Nor tomorrow - the kotakompu patrols are still too many and too vigilant. But in the not so far future the Aryakompu will lower [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guard, and in that moment [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will learn. Nanru Nakar is a city of elves, and this city won't forget. Or forgive."

But enough chit chat, I imagine you're all wondering what the announcement is.\nYou'll agree with me that the kotakompu plays a vital role in the new way of things: the mines, the army as well as the finances of everyone present here all depend on these beautiful animals. And what a smart beast the kotakompu is! Just like the Taychendi, they boast a well functioning society, with the queens governing, the warriors fighting, and the workers nourishing those above them. Considering this, you fine people will see, just like I do, that the current state of affairs can't be allowed to go on - it's an injustice perpetrated against our fine companions.\n\nTo amend this, I, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], proclaim that from this day onwards each kotakompu queen shall be awarded a minor title, together with the lands the title oversees; they shall have the same rights each Warlord enjoys and will be considered as such in front of any court.\nI hope you'll be as happy as I am to know you're contributing to righting this historical wrong committed against an entire population."\n\nBanquet Casualty Summary: 2 palace guards killed protecting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]; 7 Warlords killed by the guards; 5 killed by the ruler's kotakompu; the king's uncle, 4 guards, 12 servants and 8 nobles burned alive by a deflected fireball; 1 noble dead after choking on a chicken wing."

The driver sputtered, stammered. “A-And– they were gone before we could do anything! The queen, the trainers– h-her– her cubs–!”\n\n“WRETCH!” The King struck the driver across the face– kicked him away, sent him tumbling to the floor. Then a raged order in their chitter-chatter tongue – “KITAKITA– KAAAAGH!” Blood curdling screams accompanied the driver’s death throes as the Kotakompu pounced – devoured him alive.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to his lieutenants now, grabbed one, shook him as he cried his commands. “Death– death– DEATH–! Go into the mines– sabres out, lashes out, kompu-teeth– DEVOUR!” A look of confusion on the lieutenant’s face – the Aryakompu struck him, sent the others running. “GO! The tunnels run RED today– a blood price– for my queens, BLOOD–!”"

Bloody circles and words of power had been painted on the slave lying there, strapped in with binds of steel and gagged to stop his screams. “Raka sanjita!” The mage said, reading from the tome he held in one hand. “Rakana dhavana! Rakana sanadan! Rakana racha!” He raised a hand of bronze rings and bloody fingers, palms spread and magic flowing, “RAKA SANJITA!”\n\nThe Kotakompu chattered, licked his lips – and the Aryakompu’s grin widened, as the blood came to life. First on the table, then in the slave. His form morphed and mutated, as muscles twisted, mana flowed, and red shifted. The slave thrashed against the binds – when he tore his arm from his hand, freed his stump, the blood mage called his final command. “RAKA SAMIDHA!” The body crumpled in on itself.\n\nThe Kotakompu chittered in excitement as it leapt down from the perch, began to devour its meal. Its King applauded. The mage – Rannaraikazhil – closed the tome, turned and gave a bow. Of all the stories of old Vaokanur, there was one that stood above the rest. When North and South fought, the Witch of Blood Hevenasha had used the blood of two kings to empower her son… and from magics most foul, Elashok, the Beast of Blood and Metal was born. Ten feet tall, iron-clad and blood-bound. It had been a millennium since the old magics had been used in such a way… but now?\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s grin faded, as he regarded the gnashing teeth of the kotakompu before him – reflected on their simple, primal, awesome power. The Beast of Blood and Metal had been felled by the unstoppable rainbow-like blade of violence… but what about something else, something new? A Kompu-King, in more than name?"

 uesrennu.10.d:0 "Kottar Orenkoraim was packed full of people. The small island had in recent days seen a huge influx of people, rushing in to see the restored Giant. The works around the Gathyanavaida had been going on for more than a year by now, and the secrecy around it - the statue was fully boxed by wooden scaffolding - had everyone murmuring. It didn't help that the sculptors involved were constantly changing, many of them running away from the city in the middle of the night – their bloodied, half-devoured corpses were often found soon after.\n\nBut today all of that didn't matter, it was a joyous day for everyone present. Even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] arrived for the inauguration, and was preparing a speech. "For centuries the Giant of the Gate stood tall guarding the sea. But a sentinel without a head is like an Aryakompu without his rats.\n\nTo amend this, we've finally given the Gathyanavaida its visage back and, at the same time, honoured the right hand of our great founder, the Copper-Born-Biter. I'm proud to present to you the restored statue, from now on named the Gnawing Mother of the Gate!"\n\nA low murmur could be heard in the plaza. The King of Kompu stared at the crowd, scoffed. Then the kotakompu that circled the crowd gave a chitter-chatter cry – and he began to laugh."

The animal feelings came to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in great waves, tired kotakompu, agitated kotakompu, HUNGRY kotakompu. The hunger was overwhelming. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] commanded them to feed; the whole swarm happily obeyed, feasting on whatever was closest. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tasted all the new flavours in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own mouth. The meat was divine.\n\n"I can know them now, TRULY know! Every bite, every chatter, every contented snuffle and cry! How they feel, what they like, their thoughts!" As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned towards his blood-mage, the collective experiences of a million started taking their toll. The weight, the burden forced [Root.Monarch.GetName] to his knees. In response, the kotakompu – ALL kotakompu – gave a cry of concern. [Root.Monarch.GetName] beamed even more, despite the pain. "As I hear them, they hear me! They understand me now! Fully! This is the best day of my life!"\nTo anybody who knew the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan], even the most loyal and steelhearted follower, such a spectacle could only provoke immense disgust.\n\n"And you!

 uesrennu.12.d:0 "It was dusk when Rannaraikazhil arrived back at Uesrennu, beginning his descent into the mine-city. By the time he reached the palace, the invisible moon was high above. The mines of Uesrennu never slept – but today, they had been forced to rest. The blood of a hundred thousand filtered down to the throne room, newly repurposed as a ritual chamber. The Aryakompu greeted his blood-mage, his Flesh-Gnasher-heir by his side – beamed when he saw the ancient tomes in Rannaraikazhil’s hands, eagerly bid him deeper into the heart of Uesrennu. An excited child ready for reward. Their guards followed, but halted outside the chamber. The Mage, the King, and the Kompu went in.\n\nAnd only one came out.\n\nThe guards outside heard chanting, the rush of magic, the chatter of insanity. Then they heard the animal-shouts and the soul-screams. The smart ones ran then – those that did not were found later, fingers bloody, eyes clawed out, wailing and groaning in uncomprehension. Nobody saw what happened next – but Uesrennu felt it. Child and adult alike were ripped from slumber by night terror, then blood terror, as foul-deeds and dead-words and bone-chains broke and bound and broke again their souls. But the animals of Uesrennu did not have their strength-of-soul – and so they ran rabid. Most fled to who-knows-where – the rest? The Swarm arose, enraged – and devoured. A hundred thousand perished.\n\nAnd then, all at once, the kompu calmed. The assault ceased. Driver and soldier alike rushed to the palace – those that entered first collapsed from the sight. The Mage was the room, and the Kompu was the King, and the King was King no longer, but the God. The hulking beast, gnawed flesh, bloody bone, tall as ten-elves, strong as ten-all-kompu, rending teeth, sabre-claws. The king-face had been stretched over its rat-snout, visage an unending scream – but the God-Kompu needed it no longer. It spoke in Varamzhil’s voice, though it only uttered a single word before it broke down in manic, giddy, bloodied laughter, as if a ritual-most-foul was a mere trifle, a joke. It said: “UNION!”"

Everybody's accepted here, because everyone's equal under the light of the One Sun. And all of you are here with the same goal: to bring down the hammer of justice upon the Aryakompu, [Root.Monarch.GetName]!\n\nFor decades the Cult of Vherenar has worked in the darkness against the Uesrennu's [Root.GovernmentName]: in the depths of the mines, saving as many slaves as possible; in the devastated fields devoured by the swarm, bringing the little food we had, to help the common people survive the season; in every province of the nation, hiding anybody that attempted even the smallest of resistances.\nAnd the powers that be have resented us for that, persecuting us with everything they have! Too many of our companions have died; but for each sacrifice, we learned, improved our tactics, and found new ways to hit the Kompu kings where it hurt them the most.\nNow we're ready, our ranks filled to the brim with new courageous fighters, and our hearts united by the fire of a single purpose: extirpate the weed that is [Root.Monarch.GetName]!\n\nEverywhere in the nation, from the great city of Nanru Nakar to the humblest of hamlets, plazas like this are full of people like you, ready for the fight to come!\nPeople that lost parents to the mine, children to the hunger, friends to the rats!\n\nPeople!

USELESS WASTE OF AIR! KITAKITA… ah why bother." the King of the Kompu suddenly deflated, a small and curved husk of what was before, while the minister quickly hurried out of the room.\n\n"They've taken so many, I couldn't protect them… What's a king that can't defend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects? An abject failure, a fraud! Poor creatures… And yet… And yet! They were not killed, but captured! But a Kotakompu is strong! They should have fought off the aggressors, why didn't they? Did they abandon me? They betrayed me! The ungrateful bastards, after everything I've done for them, THEY'D LEAVE ME FOR ANOTHER? No… no, that's not possible. They must have been forced, or deceived.

It should be a moment of jubilation, but the price we had to pay was too high.\n\nNo amount of impaled sun-cultist zealots, no heretic bastion scoured and salted will return to us all the kotakompu that lost their life in this senseless war, even if it does bring satisfaction. There are simply not enough tears, or blood, to shed.\n\nDeep down, we know it is our fault. Too greedy we had been, always increasing the numbers, always expanding the swarm. Even though we felt our control slipping away - only hearing part of them instead of the entirety of the pack – we pushed onwards in our hubris. That's how they managed to steal our whiskered friends; and having them in their ranks was the only reason the heretical scum managed to put up a fight against us.\n\nWe could try to improve our blood-magic, but it's not a risk worth taking. We'll instead keep the kotakompu population stable, so that we can know and understand every single one of them.\nWe'll keep them shielded from danger - with our rule absolute in the whole continent, we have no shortage of worthless bodies to throw at a fight, or slave backs to break with labour.\n\nAnd to atone for our mistakes and thank them for their services?

Destroyed fields are sowed and planted in by farming collectives, districts in cities everywhere are getting rebuilt from the ground up; the mines are stripped of the scars of slavery, their miners finally given the decency they deserve, as free elves. A special zeal is reserved for destroying all symbols of the old regime, as millions volunteer to tear down the infinite kotakompu statues that litter Taychend.\n\nThose that surrendered without a fight have been spared – while they won't be allowed to forget the role they played, they have been allowed to keep their lives. The rest? No quarter. Too much pain and death… how could it be any other way?.\n\nAs for the Kotakompu, many discussions have been had about them. Terrible crown and treasured weapon of the Aryakompu they may be, but in some ways, they were as much victims as we were, whipped into violence and unending hunger, a perversion of their nature. They'll keep having a central place in our nation – not as a swarm of destruction, but beasts of peace, working to atone for what they were made to do.\n\nEven when the sky is clearest, a single cloud can be found in the sky though. Silverspite is a hero… but for a single elf to hold so much power, the ability to slay thousands with his bare hands, condemn millions with a word? The Aryakompu sought out that power – and now Silverspite has it. Power and spite once turned Varamzhil from freedom-fighter to bloodied maniac.
