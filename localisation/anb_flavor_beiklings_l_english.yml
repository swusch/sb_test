 flavor_beiklings.1.t:0 "The Avarice of Chinhu"
 flavor_beiklings.1.d:0 "Nothing blinds the soul quite like the glitter of gold.\n\nNestled in the Demon Hills, the Shirgrii of Kabiurgarko - called ’Chinhu’ by the local Beiklings - sits astride a veritable mountain of gold. The mines there are old, vast and seemingly endless, and it follows that the local government desires to keep this wealth to themselves. This so-called Council of Hungering Ones, has a well-earned reputation for covetousness, and they have ever been reluctant subjects at best.\n\nTherefore it comes as no surprise that tribute has gradually slowed to a trickle. We naturally assumed that the Council is hoarding the wealth, but they in turn claim that the Harimari of Hubao have been collecting taxes - that is to say, raided - across the border. The council posits that for one, they have neither the desire nor the obligation to pay taxes twice. If the government wishes to receive their taxes, they must ask Hubao. Secondly, as these raids seem to continue with no end in sight, the wealth of Chinhu is required to fend off the grasping Harimari. In truth, they posit, it is a travesty that we are not paying them for this service to the realm.\n\nIt is true that there is little love lost between the Beiklings of Chinhu and the Harimari of Hubao. Are raids across the border probable? Certainly. Provable? Perhaps.\n\nDoes this all sound like an excuse for Chinhu to keep their wealth to themselves? Absolutely."
 flavor_beiklings.1.a:0 "An excuse it may be, but we can loosen the reins for now, while we deal with Hubao."
 flavor_beiklings.1.b:0 "Everyone pays tax, except for the rich. I mean, especially the rich. Send in the taxmen!"
 flavor_beiklings.1.c:0 "A mountain of gold, you say? ...Maybe I will move to Chinhu."

 flavor_beiklings.2.t:0 "Xiongxiap Rises!"
 flavor_beiklings.2.d:0 "Our war against the Jiangshi of Jinqiu has taken an ironic turn.\n\nAs our troops crossed the border into the rugged borderlands of the Black Jade Citadel, we encountered envoys from the league of Xiongxiap. It appears that they, likely anticipating the imminent change in overlords, are willing to support our invasion against the Eternal Council, in return for certain concessions and guarantees under the new regime.\n\nWhile their lack of loyalty is deplorable, their duplicity stands to benefit us. They are weak, and while they are ready to offer us access to either their coffers or their warriors, their envoy insists that they cannot part with both. But, the envoy is quick to point out, there may be an alternative.\n\nWeizhen Suzhen, the current leader of the league, is the mind behind this plot, and he stands to lose everything if it fails. We could, rather than merely accept his modest offers of support, put our full support behind him instead. Doing so would no doubt galvanize the league into a far more formidable force, and would make Suzhen dependent on us in perpetuity."
 flavor_beiklings.2.a:0 "Local auxiliaries familiar with these lands will benefit our forces greatly."
 flavor_beiklings.2.b:0 "Is this all the wealth Xiongxiap can offer? Well, we will take it regardless."
 flavor_beiklings.2.c:0 "I detest traitors. We refuse to be linked to them."
 flavor_beiklings.2.e:0 "Send word and troops to Weizhen Suzhen. $COUNTRY$ stands with Xiongxiap!"

 flavor_beiklings.3.t:0 "Jianlin Politely Revolts!"
 flavor_beiklings.3.d:0 "Our recent investments into the city of Yangcheng has resulted in a surprising backlash. One of our own cities apparently resents our investment abroad, claiming that this money could be better spent domestically. Nowhere is this sentiment stronger than in the Beikling city of Jianlin, where the Stratocratic Order of Closed Mouths, their local government, have penned an immaculately polite, yet scathing letter, condemning what they call ’reckless expansionism and unneeded consolidation of the League of Yanszin, at the expense of the people of Yanshen in general, and the honourable citizenry of Jianlin in particular’.\n\nAs a result, the city of Jianlin now requests subsidies from the league, to encourage local development, and to prove - in their own words - ’that the leadership of the League remains committed to the rights and freedoms of the great cities on which it rests’. Doing so would no doubt be expensive, but the Jianlin leadership is to our knowledge honourable. If we support them, they will no doubt develop their domain, to the benefit of the league as a whole. And of course, should we refuse, it will no doubt lead to increased friction within the league.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 flavor_beiklings.3.a:0 "The League must prosper in unity. Let us invest in Jianlin."
 flavor_beiklings.3.b:0 "This letter is an insult. We have already given Jianlin more than they deserve."
 flavor_beiklings.3.c:0 "If they so fear being marginalized, they have another thing coming. Pack up everything! We are moving the court to Jianlin!"

 flavor_beiklings.4.t:0 "The Mask of Many Faces"
 flavor_beiklings.4.d:0 "Might, the power to rule.\nWealth, a sign of prosperity.\nControl, of oneself and of others.\nAnd Right, to sit on the throne and wear the mask.\n\nThe streets of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] are alight with lamps. Hundreds of thousands of Beiklings have donned masks, and throughout the city, festivities, parades and prayers are being held, as the people celebrate the revival of Great Luzhong.\n\nBut inside the palace, the court is silent. Heavy drapes cover the windows, and only the violet lanterns of the royal guard prevent the room from being shrouded in total darkness. Every envoy, every magistrate, and every noble rests on their knees, their heads bowed towards the throne, where $MONARCH$ stands waiting in the gloom. One by one, the masks are brought in, carried on pillows of Jinqiu black silk. As the first mask bearer reaches the throne, $MONARCH$ seizes the mask reverently, as the mask bearer kowtows at their feet. The second mask bearer does the same, as $MONARCH$ joins one mask to the other. There is no sound, no click, no tinkering required. Two simply become one, and the silence filling the room grows louder. A third joins its siblings, and the court hears the blood flowing in their veins, the silence so absolute that their heartbeats grow loud as drums. As ever so slowly, their hearts begin to beat in unison.\n\nAs the fourth and final mask is joined, the court breathes as one, a noise like a storm in the deafening quiet. For a moment, there is absolute silence. Hearts still. Breathing stalls. The court seems frozen in time. $MONARCH$ holds the Mask of Many Faces before him. There is a moment of clarity. In the silence, he can hear the mask speak, words so many that they coalesce into an incessant buzz. Words that will become his own."

One that built cities to rival those in the lowlands, and whose institutions kept a grandiose empire alive.\nThese hills in times past were compared to the night sky, dotted with lights that represented the life of our people, now long gone.\n\nThe dream of restoring our homeland is one we have had ever since its fall, but now we are closer than ever before. We are strong, powerful and wealthy like we haven't been in one thousand years. We are united and we seek nothing less than  restoration.\nThe time of decision is upon us, what shall we seek to restore next?"

 flavor_beiklings.310.t:0 "The Heart of a People"
 flavor_beiklings.310.d:0 "The restoration work wasn't just a job for those working on it; it was a matter of utmost importance. The workers rose at dawn and worked throughout the day, even past their paid time—the honor of working on such a beautiful gift was more than enough to fulfill their spirits. No foreigner was allowed near the work area - only Beiklings, the children of the Red King, were allowed to work on his gift.\n\nEvery action, every movement, every second of sunshine, was recorded by Beikling scribes basking in their wondrous efforts. The Citadel was treated as a work of art itself– the mere act of restoring this building was a tale to be told, one that deserved as grand a recounting as any other.\nIn the end, the grueling work of the Beiklings was finally done, and from it rose a grand structure worthy of the title of “The Beating Heart of the Beikling World”."

In their eyes, it was not enough—it was yet to meet the perfection they have for so long been told it once achieved. If the Citadel's greatness is equal to that of the people's, it is the Beikling's duty to make it something more.\n\nThat day, Emgolú awoke to the call. With the birth of a new day began the renovations once more, and throughout the streets thousands began making the walk uphill to the Citadel. No longer mere workers, every man, woman and even elder children came to the cause. Unpaid—as the work itself was the payment, to become immortalized in history as a resplendent people.\nThose who couldn't work still helped by beholding. They expanded upon the writing done by their predecessors and made sure nothing and no one was left behind, rescuing a people that had once been left behind by history.\n\nDay and night they laboured, day and night they tired, and day and night they laboured still. In the end it was not just the Citadel that had become greater, but the Beikling's themselves.\nBefore they had healed their wounds, but today…"

Although the time of the great raiders is long passed, this view of the region remains, depicting an underdeveloped landscape of savage, near-nomadic people.\n\nBut to us, this land is home– or at least it used to be.\n\nIn a time that precedes us, these hills were the birthplace of a civilization to rival those of the lowlands, one of great cities and advanced architectural beauty.\n\nAn era long gone to all of us, but one we dream to live once more.\n\nIt has been a long battle—every brick laid in the ground, every piece of steel forged, every waking hour of work, has been for nothing but to achieve a restoration we have only dreamed of– until now.\n\nThe rebirth of a homeland we thought lost, one our people can be truly proud of. Even if our history may never live up to the stories of old, it can become a legend of our own making.\n\nAt its core is that beautiful gift, one that now stands higher than ever as an icon of our restoration. And as the lights of the mountain are rekindled, so is the fire that burns in the heart of the Beikling people."

But it was not the usual crashing of the iron and smoldering of the metal—no, this was the sound of voices, clashing together with many words exchanged, all of them meaningless.\nThe chief leader of the forge was silent– this was a monumental day for him. Soon a man of much prestige would walk through the doors for the first time in one thousand years.\n\nThe doors flew open, allowing five men and one woman to enter the room, dressed in shining regalia and carrying many artifacts and tools. The woman stepped forward and unrolled a silk carpet of excellent quality, and one of the men took out a small blanket, book and quill.\n\nThen he entered. Wearing what could only be described as “Royal Smithing Clothes” and wearing a beautifully detailed forgers mask, he instantly became the center of attention. To the rest of the people working the forge he appeared as a mythical creature, a spirit not seen since times of yore. But to the chief it was something much different: he was a threat, someone that had come to replace him.\n\nHe was the first Forgemaster in almost one thousand years, and he came to take his place as the ruler of this forge.\nThe chief tried to present himself, to assert his dominance in a desperate attempt to cling to power, but it was ultimately futile. The Forgemaster walked towards his smiths, and with a single gesture of his hand made them follow him to the nearest cauldron. He spent the next two hours teaching them the arts of forging and smithing like only the masters of old were said to be able to do.\nThe chief looked on in silence; there was nothing else he could do. The time for simple leaders like him was over, and the new age of the Forgemasters had come."

Every drawing along the side of the maze was the same—they repeated over and over, and at times seemed to move ever so slightly,almost smiling to us while we attempted to traverse this place.\nTime ceased to exist. The only thing helping keep track of the passage of time was the slowly depleting sacks of food. Our situation soon turned dire; we stopped for a while, the traversing proving too tiresome as our legs simply gave out. Only then did we feel the floor begin to shift, moving as if it were guiding us deeper into the maze.\nThe floor moved around to lead us down different paths— so subtle we couldn't notice until then. But after that it was obvious, so obvious, as we began following the drawings on the walls and the walls began following the floor and the floor began following ourselves. We walked and walked, and we began to slowly descend, moving downwards for the first time since we entered the temple. For the first time in hours and hours and hours we had made progress moving along the floors and walls of the living temple, and we finally arrived at the end of the maze. There were no words spoken at this point, any semblance of chitchat or smalltalk gone as we flew down the halls.\nAnd at the end…\nAnd at the end…\n\nAnd at the end he was resting in silence.” 		- Writings of the Expedition upon finding the tomb of the Red King."

You are the last person I would ever believe.”\n\nThe work we did was tiresome: moving materials around, raising the supports for the building, changing old parts that simply wouldn't last. But for the two of us it was an honor to work on one of the famous old buildings of our people.\n “The Yan Toll”, they called it. A grandiose castle on the River Yan of truly immense size, decorated in the classical style of the early empire. It once saw, and taxed, hundreds of ships in their travels to Tianlou, and in the ancient times of war…\n\n“I swear I’m not lying this time,” he countered, genuine shock on his face.\n“This time? You will have to try harder to convince me, old man.”\n“Is it truly so hard to believe?”\n“I mean, have you heard yourself?

Can you believe it? One hundred and forty-nine. Taxed every one of ‘em.”\n\nWe stood on a balcony overlooking the Yan Toll. A massive number of hastily—but carefully—erected buildings lined the shores of the Yan. As ships docked, inspectors boarded and searched their cargo, flanked by guards.\n\n”I’m sure the Toll will be famous all across Haless in no time,” I said. The man next to me gave the barest hint of a smile.\n\n“The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be very pleased. I hope there have been no complaints from disgruntled captains?”\n\n”None at all,” I beamed. “Not a single one.”\n\n”Well, occasionally a ship tries to pass through without paying. It, doesn’t go well for them.”\n\nWe stood there in silence for a while, watching the organized chaos taking place below.\n\n“I’ve been having a recurring nightmare,” I said, breaking the silence. “I wake up—or, well, I think I do—and stumble outside onto this very balcony. I look out over the Yan, which is bathed in red. Around me, I can hear the screams—oh, the horrible screams. Then, I look across the river, and there’s this figure with a mask staring at me.” I steal a peek at the man next to me; his face betrayed no emotion. “That’s usually when I wake up.”"

We expect to be done within the month.\n\nI wanted to report some strange sentiments shared among many of the workers. Early on in the rebuilding effort, there were a great many questions about the reasoning for the project: ‘Why would they build this here? It’s so far from Yanshen.’ ‘The locals are very rude, can’t something be done about them?’ ‘Why would the Old Empire even bother with this project?’ Many of them also reported feeling like the very land was trying to reject the structure itself.\n\nBut now, many of them report feeling a desire to continue work on the project.
