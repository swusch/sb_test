 Z13_placeholder5_title:0 "Subjugate the Skalds"
 Z13_placeholder5_desc:0 "The Skalds of Skaldskola have long performed a vital duty to the people of Gerudia, passing down their songs to every generation. Yet their continued independence is a thorn in our side, threatening our rightful sovereignty over Olavslund. We must bring them to heel, before they would do the same to us."

 Z13_placeholder1_title:0 "Silence the Shipwrights"
 Z13_placeholder1_desc:0 "Avnkaup is known for its boisterous shipwrights, claiming to build the most magnificent of longships out of the hardest lumber from Nyrvrod. Obviously, they are wrong. Nothing compares to the Redgarhavn reavers and their vessels. Let’s prove them, by building the largest navy Gerudia has ever seen."

 Z13_placeholder2_title:0 "Reavers to War"
 Z13_placeholder2_desc:0 "The free men of Redgarhavn have a longstanding tradition of reaving, plundering and fighting. Following in the tracks of Redgar Cruelhart, we once again prepare for war!"

 Z13_placeholder4_title:0 "One under Olavslund"
 Z13_placeholder4_desc:0 "We have succeeded where others have failed. We have brought all the petty kingdoms and warring tribes of Olavslund under one banner, either through cunning diplomacy or glorious conquest. Now it is time to unite the men of Olavslund under one banner, the Kraken of Olav."

 Z13_placeholder3_title:0 "Liberate Naugsvol"
 Z13_placeholder3_desc:0 "The cowherders of Naugsvol have let themselves be invaded by a resurgent Urviksten! Should we allow the sons of Ebonfrost continue their march across Olavslund, this will surely spell disaster for us. We must protect the people of Naugsvol to guarantee our own independence, whether they like it or no."

 Z13_placeholder6_title:0 "Out with the Old"
 Z13_placeholder6_desc:0 "The Dynasty of Ebonfrost once ruled all of Olavslund, and many distant lands beyond. They foolishly seek to do so again, after being humiliated by southerners and puny elves from across the ocean. We shall let them know that the ambition of the sons of Urvik ends now, and that it’s the followers of Redgar who shall rule."


 olavlund_placeholder_2_title:0 "Secure a stockpile"
 olavlund_placeholder_2_desc:0 "Though our Dalr cousins try to deny it, reaving is in our blood. Any true Gerudian son hasn’t become a proper man until he has set sail across the Bay of Chills, and plundered the Reachman coasts and villages. We must continue this tradition, and begin amassing a fortune in plunder and gold!"

 olavlund_placeholder_12_title:0 "Rebuild the Homeland"
 olavlund_placeholder_12_desc:0 "The lands of Gerudia are often harsh and inhospitable. While this makes for strong men, hunger is never far away. This has been what drove our forefathers to take what is theirs from the weak southerners. If we wish to build a proper state that rivals the wealthy kingdoms of the south, however, we should invest in our towns and villages. Set up farms, mines and lumbercamps, so our people can finally thrive instead of just survive."

 olavlund_placeholder_13_title:0 "Clan Council"
 olavlund_placeholder_13_desc:0 "The Olavish people are fiercely independent, and it has been no easy task to unify them into a single unitary state. Perhaps this task can be made easier by giving all of the former clans a say in Olavish government. By establishing a Thing assembly, or Clan Council, we can give every clan in Olavlund the means to have a say in Olavish politics."

 olavlund_placeholder_14_title:0 "Enforce Impressment"
 olavlund_placeholder_14_desc:0 "In order to fend off the Greytide, it has been important that every man, woman and child does what they can to contribute to Olavlund’s safety and stability. Now, we have the unique opportunity to codify these measurements into law, by issuing mandatory impressment for any able-bodied man to serve on our galleys in times of war."

 olavlund_placeholder_18_title:0 "Safeguard our Whales"
 olavlund_placeholder_18_desc:0 "Every Olavish peasant should know how to catch a fish to survive. Yet it is further asea, deep in the Giant’s Grave Sea, where true wealth can be found. Though it is no easy job, whaling has been one of the more lucrative businesses in Gerudia. To ensure our future wealth, we must safeguard the whaling industry by protecting our fleets, and expanding our operations across the coast."

 olavlund_placeholder_19_title:0 "Whaling Monopoly"
 olavlund_placeholder_19_desc:0 "As oil from whale blubber becomes a vital part in Alenic industries, Olavish whale meat has become a delicacy as far south as Lorentainé. Even the bones of the whales we catch have become valuable material to use in jewelry. As our name becomes more famous across Halann, so too do our products. "

 olavlund_placeholder_3_title:0 "Looking Outwards"
 olavlund_placeholder_3_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Bjarnrík is our greatest rival in Gerudia proper. Though their kingdom is more centralized than ours, their people chave under the iron grasp of the Crown of Bera. We must strike first, and shatter their kingdom."

 olavlund_placeholder_11_title:0 "A Worthy Flagship"
 olavlund_placeholder_11_desc:0 "How can we call ourselves true reavers, without a mighty flagship to boast about? Commission the shipwrights to create their largest vessel yet, with twice as many oars as any galley. A worthy nightmare to haunt the southerner’s dreams.  "

 olavlund_placeholder_16_title:0 "In the Shadow no More"
 olavlund_placeholder_16_desc:0 "Our victory over Bjarnrík has secured our dominance in Gerudia. Our Dalric cousins will be liberated from the oppressive chains of absolute monarchs, and be shown the values of Olavish freedom! "

 olavlund_placeholder_17_title:0 "Streamlining Ebonsteel"
 olavlund_placeholder_17_desc:0 "The Ebonfrosts of Urviksten have always closely guarded the secrets of making Ebonsteel. Yet for the good of all Olavlund, we must streamline the process of making Ebonsteel to truly have an edge over our rivals, even should it harm our economy in the short term."

 olavlund_placeholder_32_title:0 "Ebonsteel Perfected"
 olavlund_placeholder_32_desc:0 "The forges have been restarted, and production of Ebonsteel across Olavlund is well under way. With this superior steel, we can forge an army without equal."

 olavlund_placeholder_33_title:0 "Joint Command"
 olavlund_placeholder_33_desc:0 "Through the combination of our Ebonsteel regiments and the dreaded reaver corps, our army has become a force to be reckoned with, both on land and on sea. The integration of arms has made us more flexible and, as a result, more fearsome. "

 olavlund_placeholder_1_title:0 "The Clans United"
 olavlund_placeholder_1_desc:0 "For decades, the Olavish have been divided into disparate, squabbling clans. But no more! By pen or by sword, we have united the clans into a new, Olavish state. The birth of Olavlund!"

 olavlund_placeholder_6_title:0 "Keeping the Dragon Tame"
 olavlund_placeholder_6_desc:0 "It has been said that the Skald’s songs keep the White Dragon, Elkaesal, in a deep sleep. How much of this is true remains impossible to say, yet the Skaldic songs have become a large influence in Olavish culture. Organizing the Skalds into a more organized faith will no doubt help us weather the tide of religious conflict brewing in the south. "

 olavlund_placeholder_15_title:0 "Into the Bay"
 olavlund_placeholder_15_desc:0 "For decades have we raided the coasts of Vrorenmarch, enjoying the fruits of their wealth. When their kingdom fell to the Graytide, those lands were despoiled not by us, but by brutish orcs. Perhaps it would be better if we conquered these lands for ourselves, and reap the benefit of conquest not as reavers, but as liberators."

 olavlund_placeholder_22_title:0 "Controlling the Merchantmen"
 olavlund_placeholder_22_desc:0 "Many vessels cross the Bay of Chills to peddle their goods and wares, making trade a lucrative aspect of Gerudian economy. By controlling every major port in the Bay of Chills, our coffers will be filled up with honest gold, no doubt just as valuable as stolen gold!"

 olavlund_placeholder_23_title:0 "Utilize the Wood"
 olavlund_placeholder_23_desc:0 "The vast forests of Gerudia provide an abundant quantity in some of the highest quality of hardwood. By instituting logging camps in service of the state, we can put these resources to use by making impervious warships, building impressive wooden longhouses or creating large forges for our Ebonsteel production. Yet we must be prudent, as each project will require sufficient resources allocated to it, and it’ll be unlikely that we can do everything at the same time."

 olavlund_placeholder_24_title:0 "Wooden Walls of Gerudia"
 olavlund_placeholder_24_desc:0 "Though our pallisades are made of wood, it’s as strong as any southern wall of stone. Using the  highest quality of Gerudian hardwood, we shall make a set of forts along our borders to scare off any would-be invader."

 olavlund_placeholder_31_title:0 "The Ideal Port"
 olavlund_placeholder_31_desc:0 "Though the Bay of Chills has grown rich under our rule, it still pales in comparison to the riches of the Dameshead. These plump southern men have grown decadent and rich for years. If we were to seize a port on the Dameshead, these riches could be ours for  the taking!"

 olavlund_placeholder_4_title:0 "Expedition into the East"
 olavlund_placeholder_4_desc:0 "When the Orcish hordes spilled out of the Serpentspine, they trampled hundreds of human clans, driving them from their homes. Two smaller clans have since broken off from the main Grey host, dissatisfied with their rule. We shall make an example out of them. Drive the Grey Orcs out of our lands, permanently."

 olavlund_placeholder_7_title:0 "Subjugate the Matriarchy"
 olavlund_placeholder_7_desc:0 "The Valkyries of Vaengheim have been a common sight in Gerudia. Their beautiful songs complement the sagas of our Skalds, while their wings bear our wounded warriors away from the battlefield, saving them from certain death. If we could convince their matriarch to join the people of Olavslund in one nation, with certain privileges and promises of autonomy of course, all of Gerudia would stand to benefit."

 olavlund_placeholder_10_title:0 "United in Cause"
 olavlund_placeholder_10_desc:0 "The people of Escann have suffered much and more under the hands of the Greentide. Yet their fortunes are now turning, with many of the orcs ending up in chains, forced to do hard labour. We always have need for more hands in the logging camps or the iron mines. Why not make use of such cheap labour? "

 olavlund_placeholder_21_title:0 "The Reaverholds"
 olavlund_placeholder_21_desc:0 "Long ago, in the era of Black Ice, the lands of the Dragon Coast were held by intrepid reavers from Reveria and beyond. Situated at the edge of Cannor, with oceans all around, it would make a perfect outpost to launch further raids from."

 olavlund_placeholder_28_title:0 "Gerudian Hegemony"
 olavlund_placeholder_28_desc:0 "We stand as the undisputed masters of Gerudia. No Gerudian has managed to unify the entire Bay since the days of Black Castanor, until we came along. No longer shall we stand in the shadows of the great reaver-kings of old, as we forge a new path for all Gerudia!"

 olavlund_placeholder_29_title:0 "Defeat the Alens"
 olavlund_placeholder_29_desc:0 "Though still southerners, the men of the Alen are much like us. Hardy, strong and stubborn to boot! This makes them ideal subjects of Olavlund. Though the Gawedi have long been a force to be reckoned with, we shall show our dominance over the Alenics once and for all."

 olavlund_placeholder_34_title:0 "Terror of the North"
 olavlund_placeholder_34_desc:0 "Our Reaver corps have become force to be reckoned with. Not just in Gerudia, nor Cannor, but all of Halann has known the names of our fearsome Reavers! As their fame grows, more men will flock to the corps, eager to make a name for themselves in battle!"

 olavlund_placeholder_5_title:0 "A Great Navy"
 olavlund_placeholder_5_desc:0 "It is from Redgarhavn that most of our ships set sail, either trading or reaving along the coasts of Gerudia. Yet most activity is only seasonal, with sailors spending the summers on their farms. We should institute a standing navy to contest our waves, that is able to operate year-round. For this to work, we must first expand our wharfs and shipyards, allowing for even more construction."

 olavlund_placeholder_8_title:0 "Olav’s Wish"
 olavlund_placeholder_8_desc:0 "The Grey Orcs remain a threat to our way of life, their savage nature making them impossible to control. We must drive them from our lands, or force them into slavery, making way for humanity to once again live in these lands."

 olavlund_placeholder_9_title:0 "Whaling Industries"
 olavlund_placeholder_9_desc:0 "Though Giant’s Manse surely filled some sort of purpose during the age of Giants, it now serves as the ideal whaling outpost for our whalers, situated in the middle of the Giant’s Grave Sea as it is. If we wish to capitalize on the whaling industry, we should expand facilities on the island to allow for more whalers to come and go to ply their trade. "

 olavlund_placeholder_20_title:0 "Workers, not Foes"
 olavlund_placeholder_20_desc:0 "Though perhaps not the most motivated workforce, the Orcish slaves have proven themselves to be excellent at many forms of physical labour. Owing to the influx of more and more orcs to our workforce, our lumberjacks have been able to expand their operations through all of Gerudia. Though costly, it’ll surely be beneficial to fund their operations, and provide them a steady supply of investments and grey labour."

 olavlund_placeholder_26_title:0 "Olavlunder Marines"
 olavlund_placeholder_26_desc:0 "Our reaver heritage has lead us to adopt a particular style of amphibious warfare. Regiments of reavers raid and pillage our enemy’s coast, before disembarking from their galleys and wreaking havoc among enemy ranks, using their superior mobility to surprise our foes."

 olavlund_placeholder_27_title:0 "Lessons of Ebonsteel"
 olavlund_placeholder_27_desc:0 "Combining the Ebonsteel regiments from the old Ebonfrost forges with our newly refurbished Reaver corps, we are able to strike swiftly and wherever our enemy least expects it. Though at the cost of our standing army, we should invest more into our Reaver corps, to gain a unique edge over our rivals."

 olavlund_placeholder_30_title:0 "Raiding Regiments"
 olavlund_placeholder_30_desc:0 "Our fleet has become the nightmare of all Cannorians, with nary a single port safe from our raiding parties. Combined with our ever-growing Reaver corps, we have become a true power on both naval and land. Send more able men to our fleet, a second Era of Black Ice is upon us!"

 olavlund_placeholder_35_title:0 "Tame the Thaw"
 olavlund_placeholder_35_desc:0 "Amongst seasoned merchants and raiders, rumours of golden coasts in the west had long been circulating, whatever brave soul would undertake such journeys surely was in need of safe ports along the isles of the Thaw."

 olavlund_placeholder_36_title:0 "To Brave the New World" 
 olavlund_placeholder_36_desc:0 ""Follow the birds" was the command given by legendary seafairer Britta Magdasdottr, her crews faith never waivering. And after weeks of arduous journey their winged scouts did not dissapoint: A new world lay before them, ripe for the taking."

 olavlund_placeholder_37_title:0 "The first Kontor"
 olavlund_placeholder_37_desc:0 "To the South of the icey shores of Dalaire, we discovered a larger island, Brittas crew was quick to establish an initial supply depot and Kontor, to send back news of their triumph and ask for more good and support in return."

 olavlund_placeholder_38_title:0 "Foundation of Glodsandr"
 olavlund_placeholder_38_desc:0 "The disenfranchised lower classes, the veterans, hopeful families and adventurers are quickly streaming into our new colonies, its high time to create administrative structures over seas to maintain order and protect our investments."

 olavlund_placeholder_39_title:0 "New Olavlund"
 olavlund_placeholder_39_desc:0 "Our largest hub on the mainland is quickly becoming the very green bay we had first landed on, here Magda and her followes would make a city for themselves in the honour of their homeland back in Gerudia!"

 olavlund_placeholder_40_title:0 "Whale, hello there!"
 olavlund_placeholder_40_desc:0 "Next to forestry, the whaling business is our largest prospect in the new world, its high time we established a central hub for the processing of these magnificent beasts."

 olavlund_placeholder_41_title:0 "Its gold outside"
 olavlund_placeholder_41_desc:0 "When Ardbert of Baldersby discovered the first golden vein in his new iron mine alongside the Dalairi coast, many more were quick to follow. After ecstacy at first, regulations were quickly put in place to not flood the Gerudian economy with the precious metals however."

 olavlund_placeholder_42_title:0 "Lets branch out"
 olavlund_placeholder_42_desc:0 "The Gold of the new world is already being shipped back home for great profits, it is high time we fuel our industries here and in Gerudia with Logs from Dalaire as well!"

 olavlund_placeholder_43_title:0 "Wood you believe it?"
 olavlund_placeholder_43_desc:0 "Nobody knows how to tame the trees of this world better than us! The men and women of the five clans are masters of wood and a few thousand miles of water will not stop that."

 olavlund_placeholder_45_title:0 "The Crown Wood Colony"
 olavlund_placeholder_45_desc:0  "It has been decades since Magda first set foot in Dalaire, and since then Glodsandr has grown into a pillar of industry our homelands rely upon, we should elevate them and ensure their shipments flow undisturbed."

 olavlund_placeholder_46_title:0 "The Wood must flow"
 olavlund_placeholder_46_desc:0 "It is said that the largest and most precious bounties from Dalaire are no longer the gold, but the Wood Fleets, the trade brought in from Dalaire to the Serpentshead is now a core part of our economy, we would do well to expand on it."

 olavlund_placeholder_47_title:0 "New Neighbours..."
 olavlund_placeholder_47_desc:0 "The degenerate elves of these shores make for poor labour, more alike animals in our eyes than their moon or sun kissed cousins, however it seems more advanced civilizations prosper further inland..."

 olavlund_placeholder_48_title:0 "Barking up the right tree"
 olavlund_placeholder_48_desc:0 "The first generations of foresters are now born to colonizers, having never been back home, these woodworkers know how to set up logging camps in even the harshest climates and environments."

 olavlund_placeholder_49_title:0 "Slavin' Away"
 olavlund_placeholder_49_desc:0 "Just as Green Orcs are being shipped out of Escann to support colonization efforts, we shall ship these Ynnic Elves back to Gerudia, either having them work our iron mines or sell them at a premium in Vertesk and Nathalaire."

 olavlund_placeholder_50_title:0 "The Greatest Price"
 olavlund_placeholder_50_desc:0 "The Ynn is tamed, the shores are ours, yet tales of a hidden realm even further to the west still entice us - what relics could lie beyond the icy passages of the Broken Seas?"

 olavlund_placeholder_51_title:0 "The Age of Wood and Ice"
 olavlund_placeholder_51_desc:0 "In ages past, Magdas fleet had first established our presence on this continent, but nobody could have forseen then the dominance and exploitation we would manage to achieve, now an entire continent bows to us and the wealth flowing to Gerudia is unimaginable."

 olavlund.905.d:0 "For generations, the people of Redgarhavn have revered the sea not only as a source of sustenance but as a means of fortune. Their longships, crafted with care and infused with ancestral might, have long been idle, waiting for the moment to return to their ancient ways. As the winds change and the horizon grows restless, the time has come to reclaim the traditions of the Old Ways. With the kingdom united under Redgarhavn's banner and the scent of saltwater heavy in the air, the call to raid has never been clearer.\n\nThe people of Redgarhavn, proud of their Olavish heritage, are ready to once again set sail across the coastline, taking from their neighbors and asserting their might on the shores of distant lands. The longships are prepped, the warriors are eager, and the gods themselves seem to beckon the Redgarhavn fleet to the waves."
