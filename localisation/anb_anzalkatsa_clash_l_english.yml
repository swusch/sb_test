 anzalkatsa_switch_religious_school_desc:0 "As the debates of the Clash of Schools rage on in the halls of scholars, the streets of the cities, and battle over in skirmishes and wars, it has become apparent that our philosophical view has fallen out of favour in Lizardfolk society. Our people question our court's leanings, and many scholars harangue our ruler for what they term as incorrect beliefs. In such a situation, some of our advisors are recommending we make a break with our beliefs, and declare our support for the opposite school - lest we be left behind with the times.\n\nThough it would put us on the ‘winning’ side, our advisors also suggest it could bring instability in the court to so fundamentally change our doctrine. Not to mention the anger it will incur from the Naga, who have been our chief advisors on religious practice. This would be stepping into their domain and contradicting what they have been advising."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.4.t:0 "Renaissance of Old Thought"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.4.d:0 "The idea of rediscovering and appreciating old works is certainly not a foreign idea - we did not need a human to tell us of the wonders of the past, especially our past - but with the recent spread of the idea of a ‘Renaissance’ reaching our lands, it has led to an intensification of the study of our ancient writers and theorists. Works such as Nulri Dreamscribe’s Three Hundred and Thirty-Three and Thuz Bluescale’s On Balancing Scales, considered exemplary examples of the intellectual output of the 332nd Empire, are being consulted once again by scholars of all types across Taneyas. As the best preservers of this past, the texts and studies of these ancient works are coming from the followers of the Sculptors of Being, their temples busy with scribes copying and disseminating these texts, as architects study the ancient buildings of Zerat and Karassk and plan their own to be built in their image.\n\nThe rise and influence of these works has naturally led to a bolstering of the positions of the Sculptors of Being. They argue that these works prove the strength of the 332nd Empire, and that by looking at the past and the great works they have accomplished allows the better shaping of the present. With the wise knowledge of their predecessors, all Lizardfolk will be better prepared for the 333rd Empire to arrive."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.4.a:0 "Musty old tomes are not where the 333rd Empire lies."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.4.b:0 "We shall find our future with lessons from the past."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.5.t:0 "Colonies new and Colonies old"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.5.d:0 "News has come from abroad of a new land - or old one, by some accounts, of ‘Aelantir’. It appears that the Cannorians have begun to explore and colonise this land, and create their own empires. As news of this has spread down to Taneyas, it has caused us to reflect on our own history of colonisation, specifically the efforts of the old 332nd Empire. Many followers of the Sculptors of Being have set to work recovering lost information and history about the institutions of colonisation, records of lost settlements, and even contact with those Lizardfolk communities that are remnants of these lost outposts of the 332nd Empire.\n\nWhat has been discovered has been rather fascinating, and much discussed amongst both noble and intellectual alike throughout Taneyas. The knowledge that we once spread far beyond our current lands into Fangaula and the Shadow Swamp, of the formidable institutions that enabled this expansion, and of the influences that still remain from this ancient age of colonisation, has done much to increase the opinion towards the 332nd Empire and its legacy. The followers of the Sculptors of Being have done much to promote this effort, and many now see their position as the correct one - why destroy the legacy of an empire that could achieve such great extent and influence?"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.5.a:0 "These diversions will not bring us closer to the 333rd empire!"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.5.b:0 "The roots of the 332nd Empire run deep, even outside Taneyas."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.6.t:0 "The Printing of Ideas"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.6.d:0 "“...Contrary to what some may say, we cannot rely on fate to simply occur and bring forth our 333rd Empire. It is not something that will come ordained to us, appearing when it is most needed. It is not a pot which will only boil when we turn away - where we return and find our empire arrived. It is a fate we must forge with our own two hands, with all the effort and might we can muster. The spires must be claimed, the Lizardfolk unified, and the old ways torn down and trampled upon to make way for the future.\n\nThey may talk of leaving this to others, the ankashyi, the naga and the soldiers, but is it not our purpose to strive for this goal? To fight for it, to achieve it. Even we, the humble Lizardfolk of this land, must do all we can to strive towards our destiny. So I call on all of you now: tear down the past! Expunge and destroy it! Find all that remains and end it. Together, we shall step ever closer to our future.”-Extract from ‘What must we do?’, a controversial text printed by Kizwa Flametongue in support of the Sculptors of Fate"

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.7.t:0 "New Traders, New Ideas"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.7.d:0 "“...Though the expansive nature of our correspondence and our many discussions on the voyage speak for themselves, I feel I must explicitly express my thanks for our warm friendship. Though I was certainly no stranger to the ways of foreign-folk, before the arrival of the trading voyage you accompanied I had thought little about them. But then, by meeting you, I was truly introduced to them. Different forms of governance, political organisation, trade, warfare, belief systems, and technology… All fascinating and new to me. I cherish the books you have given to me, and pore over them as I translate them into Zytazashtu. I know you do the same with the books I gifted you - I only hope I was a suitable enough tutor in our tongue for you to tackle the texts.\n\nAs I have told you, I am not so unique amongst the Lizardfolk anymore in my learning of and appreciation for foreign knowledge. New traders from across the waters visit our shores every day, and each of them help spread new ideas, be they Cannorian, like yourself, or Yansheni, Raheni, even a few Ruinborn from Aelantir! Each of them brings new ideas, ones that have influenced our own thoughts. Many more now question the ways of the old 332nd Empire, and their adherents in the Sculptors of Being. The Sculptors of Fate argue that, as some of these new ideas are acceptable and beneficial to Lizardfolk, should we not replace the old ways with these new ones, to bring forth the 333rd Empire?\n\nI do not know which way the debate will inevitably end when our last Empire is founded, but I know now which side of it I stand on.\n\nWith Kind Regards,\nQakot Waverider”\n-Extract from the Qakot-Amiera Correspondence, $YEAR$"

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.8.t:0 "A Old Threat"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.8.d:0 "Concerning news has come from those who live on the frontiers with the Ashhana tribes, as the bloodcursed tribes have found themselves a unified ruler. They rule over most of their people, and proclaim their goal to bring the rest under their dominion. Such a unified and controlled polity of the Ashhana lizards, no matter what their proclamations of their intentions toward lands outside of the Ashhana tribes, has brought worry and alarm across the rest of the Lizardfolk.\n\nThis has led many to study the past, to see what answers lie there - and discover that there is little. The 332nd Empire, after all, was brought down by the bloodcursed berserkers, and thus their texts offer little answers on how to respond to the return of this great threat. This has led to a great outpouring of new ideas, thoughts and theories on how best to respond to the rise in power of the Ashhana, often couched in criticisms of the 332nd Empire’s approach to them. This has led to a general increase in the prestige of the Sculptors of Fate, whose scholars are leading this charge, and support for their beliefs have grown."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.8.a:0 "Our final empire will not fall to such enemies."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.8.b:0 "But tried and tested tactics are the best ones!"

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.9.t:0 "Heretical ideas"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.9.d:0 "All lizardfolk belief is built around the goal of the construction of the final, 333rd Empire. All who hunt in the jungles, march in the army, write in the cities, and perform any other task besides, do so in the belief it brings our fate that one step closer. It is the reason we rise in the morning, and rest in the evening, and motivates the actions and choices of rulers across Taneyas. What would a rhadakaya do if they lost this purpose? How could they exist without it?\n\nIt is a question that has become surprisingly and worryingly prescient as the rulers of a Lizardfolk nation have decided to abandon Anzalkhatsa, swearing for a heathen belief system, utterly alien to these lands and our people. As this news is digested across Taneyas, the Sculptors of Belief have been quick to come up with an explanation for this action. They accuse the Sculptors of Fate, known for their promotion and adoption of foreign ideas, of pushing too far and now inviting heresy into the hearts of Lizardfolk. Though they strenuously deny the accusation, many Lizardfolk see truth in it, and have turned away from the Sculptors of Fate and their arguments."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.9.a:0 "They took their studies too far."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.9.b:0 "The 333rd Empire shall not be found in heathen beliefs!"

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.10.t:0 "A New Threat"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.10.d:0 "While our land has never been totally safe from invaders, these have often been limited to incursions at best. There has been a change in our fortunes, however, as a new, organised and serious threat has launched not just an intrusion, but a true invasion of Taneyas not seen since that which broke the 332nd Empire. Foreigners, unfamiliar with our ways and even hostile to them, have claimed dominion over numerous Lizardfolk settlements and a large swathe of our land, disrupting the ambitions of all faithful in preparing our people for the 333rd Empire.\n\nWhile many look for answers on why this has occurred, the Sculptors of Fate have been targeted, with many arguing that the disarray and division they have brought to Lizardfolk lands created the opening which these hostile invaders have exploited. If the Lizardfolk were still united in upholding the 332nd Empire, its institutions, wealth, and power, and not trying to tear these facets down, the invaders would have been repulsed, goes the argument. This has caused a reaction against the Sculptors of Fate, and a rise in followers of the Sculptors of Belief."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.10.a:0 "The rot of the 332nd is what is inviting these invasions, not deterring them!"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.10.b:0 "The disunity the Sculptors of Fate bring has invited this disaster."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.11.t:0 "New Cities Springing Up"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.11.d:0 "One factor that the Sculptors of Belief always point to when arguing their views is the imperial cities that are spread across Taneyas. The majesty of their architecture, the size of their population and centrality to Lizardfolk trade and governance are all the proof they need of the continued influence and powerful legacy of the 332nd Empire. If what they constructed was so poor, why do people still continue to flock to these centres to live and work there? Why do the Sculptors of Fate not build something of their own?\n\nIt appears that such a criticism has been taken to heart, as a new city has risen to great prominence, even eclipsing many of the Imperial Cities. Its origins do not lie in the ancient 332nd Empire, but in the modern reality of Taneyas - not built on the bones of the old, but instead being built from the ground up as something fresh and new. This has impressed many Lizardfolk who have heard of or even visited the new metropolis, and now see the Sculptors of Fate - whose believers were the main drivers behind this new city - as being correct in their beliefs on the practice of Anzalkatsa."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.11.a:0 "If you build it, they will come."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.11.b:0 "But all roads lead to Zerat, do they not?"

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.12.t:0 "The Reformed Ashhana"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.12.d:0 "Shocking news has been spreading rapidly through the courts of the lizardfolk, and then down to the populace from those courts - visitors from the Ashhana lands of Taneyas, who are just that - visitors. Not conquerors, invaders, or slavering beasts intent on death and destruction. It seems that they have managed to rein in what they call the ‘blood-curse’, which renders them into the brutes they are widely known as in lizardfolk lands. They say they have conquered it, and seek only peace and understanding between our two ‘brethren’ people, as they describe it.\n\nThis request has been met with rather different responses from different courts. Those of the Sculptors of Fate, ever eager to change lizardfolk society, have been rather welcoming of the Ashhana, and willing to hear them out - in some cases, even sending envoys to their lands to continue these talks. The Sculptors of Being have, conversely reacted with scorn and suspicion. They see it as simply a ruse from the enemy of all civilised lizardfolk to continue to undermine the ambitions of the Anzalkatsa faithful - especially considering the Ashhana’s heretical beliefs. Amongst the people, the latter’s arguments have become more popular, as they are ever suspicious of the crocodilian lizardfolk."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.12.a:0 "Surely we should give them a chance?"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.12.b:0 "They are barbaric heretics and nothing more."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.13.t:0 "Karrask Endures"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.13.d:0 "Most reckoned that Karrask was soon to be relegated to the history books. First attacked by the upstart Katyradz Riverclaw of Asarta, and then by rebels on the islands of Karshyr, it seemed to most outside observers that Karrask, once one of the mightiest Lizardfolk kingdoms when it led the Karassian Polity, would fall to these invaders and rebels. This was only made more certain in the eyes of many after Katyradz captured the fortress of Ashuzal, leaving the way to the city of Karrask open. Assailed on all sides by these opponents, the stronghold of both an Imperial city and a follower of the Sculptors of Belief falling to their philosophical opponents heralded to many what direction the future of the Lizardfolk lay, and that was in the beliefs of the Sculptors of Fate.\n\nBut, despite these opponents and threats arranged against them, Karrask has survived - certainly battered and bruised by the encounter, but still standing in defiance of those who attempted to subdue it. This has already sent shocks throughout Lizardfolk society, especially in the wake of Rayaz’s conquest of Zerat, which marked to many the way the wind was blowing in Taneyas. Many who swore by the Sculptors of Fate after this now see the Sculptors of Being in a new light - and some more now argue that Karrask’s resilience in the face of this invasion vindicates their beliefs."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.13.a:0 "They may not have fallen this time, but they shall do so in time."
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.13.b:0 "True believers are not so easily beaten!"

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.14.t:0 "Sculptors of Being Take new Land!"
 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.14.d:0 "With the latest shifting of land in Taneyas, followers of the Sculptors of Being have expanded their control over the Imperial cities. Already they have begun work to restore parts of the 332nd Empire, rebuilding its symbols and iconography, flying its banners, and repairing buildings constructed under its rule. This conquest and restoration work has convinced more Lizardfolk of the righteousness of the Sculptors of Being’s beliefs, and now work to maintain the institutions of the 332nd Empire."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.16.d:0 "Fate is something solid. It is something anyone can influence, through their words, deeds and actions, to bring fate closer or to push it away. It can be charted in the stars, and its course brought closer. This belief has been proven correct, as a follower of the Sculptors of Fate has founded the 333rd Empire. They have swept away the past of the 332nd Empire, tearing down its polities, institutions and symbols and replacing them with everything and anything new - be they homegrown ideas and practices, or those adopted from abroad. Through this new knowledge and new thinking, they have forged a path to the Final Empire.\n\nThe fate that is left for those Lizardfolk who believed in the Sculptors of Being is to simply admit they were wrong and embrace the beliefs of the Sculptors of Fate as that which has led to the 333rd Empire. Already, many scholars who swore by the belief are denouncing their writings extolling it, and some chiefs and rulers who followed it are clearing out any signs of the Penultimate Empire and replacing it with the new symbology of the 333rd. And everywhere, all believe that the 333rd Empire will now bring all Lizardfolk together, and into the future."

 AnzalkatsaSchoolFightEvents.17.d:0 "Fate is something ephemeral. One cannot alter its course or predict its arrival - it simply arrives, and will be self-evident once it does. This belief has been proven in the eyes of all Lizardfolk as a follower of the Sculptors of Belief has founded the 333rd Empire. They have maintained the past of the 332nd Empire, bolstering its institutions, maintaining its Imperial Cities, and keeping alive its legacy and symbols. Through quiet, careful reform to these ancient practices and organisations, bringing forth subtle changes to that which was already in place, they have moulded themselves into the Final Empire.\n\nThe only choice left for those Lizardfolk who believed in the Sculptors of Fate, once a vast majority of the Anzalkatsa faithful, is to accept that they were wrong, and that it was the careful reform they so detested that has fulfilled the Prophecy of the 333rd Empire. Many Followers of the Sculptors of Fate now flock to the Imperial Cities in a pilgrimage of sorts, seeking to wash out their old beliefs by witnessing the grandeur of the cities, and any rulers not under the dominion of Khatalashya hurriedly put up the iconography of the 332nd, now 333rd, empire."
