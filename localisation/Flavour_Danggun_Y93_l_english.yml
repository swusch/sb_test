 ### Events
 danggun.1.t:0 "The Trials of Sado"
 danggun.1.d:0 "(Placeholder)Manjang was the first person to bring peace to the entirety of Gowon between man and spirit. In his quest to achieve this peace, he proved himself a fair and just ruler, showing no inherent biases to the groups he mediated. Alongside feats of magic and the unification of the human Gowon tribes behind him, he found himself in the position to truly bring peace to the land. He travelled to Nakseseom, and negotiated the Compacts with Sado. Confirmed with a marriage, these Compacts would serve as the foundation of law that would govern the Human and Spirits of Gowonsa\n\nWith his death, the tradition began where rulers of realms in Gowon would travel to Nakseseom to seek the hand of Sado in marriage. Those she deemed worthy would rise to the status of Sage King. Those not deemed worthy would find themselves short of their liver, and return to a realm in which they only half govern.\n\nThe Compacts are a set of laws that give human rulers in Gowon the right to enforce law to the Spirit inhabitants of the region. They have the right to, with fair adjudication, enforce punishment up to and including exorcism to the spirit population should they deem it worthy. This law is only required to be followed if a human ruler is a Sage King. If they are not a Sage King, the local populations of Spirits will usually return to their organisations they have at more regional levels, which itself is unable to be enforced from the top down by Human rulers, but is a unilateral localised agreement."
