 ### Missions
 Y98_plight_of_the_upper_raheni_title:0 "Plight Of The Upper Raheni"
 Y98_plight_of_the_upper_raheni_desc:0 "With the buffer states of Sir and Ghatasak established, we have ample claim to drive out the hobgoblins, orcs, and humans who might seek to control the Shamakhad fields.\n\nLet us liberate the land of our subject states back into their hands and weaken the powers that be."
 Y98_liberation_for_all_title:0 "Liberation For All"
 Y98_liberation_for_all_desc:0 "With the city of Sir secured and the state of Ghatasak fully restored we can now strive to push out the remaining hobgoblins, back deep into their wretched caves.\n\nLet us push them back into the Jade Mines until the only shade of red the hobgoblins cast over Haless is their blood."
 Y98_torches_for_all_title:0 "Torches For All"
 Y98_torches_for_all_desc:0 "Our artificers wish for us to establish a foothold in the Jade Mines, so that they may exploit the valuable resources inside. It is imperative, however, that we ensure the Shamakhad fields are secure from any violent and monstrous states. We should crush any orc clan which is not shepherded by man."
 Y98_jade_for_all_title:0 "Jade For All"
 Y98_jade_for_all_desc:0 "The artificers were satisfied with our acquisition of caves rich in natural resources, for a while. But now they come and petition before court, again. Not a week goes by that a man of science does not bother [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] about needing more steel for the manufactories or more bronze for something else. It is time we ensured the supply."
 Y98_daxugo_reforms_title:0 "Daxugo Reforms"
 Y98_daxugo_reforms_desc:0 "If we wish to come out of this period of unrest with our empire intact, we shall need to negotiate with local leaders of all factions, and make concessions of autonomy whilst demanding loyalty and levies. At the same time a large sum of money will have to be gathered to grease palms and pay reparations for our conquests.\n\nThis all shall be a temporary measure to calm down the situation, of course!"
 Y98_jiangyang_unification_title:0 "Jiangyang Pacification"
 Y98_jiangyang_unification_desc:0 "When we sent emissaries to rebellious Jiangyang provinces to demand they cease their rebellion, they never returned. When we subsequently sent emissaries to rebellious Jiangyang provinces to ask what it would take for them to cease their rebellion, some returned with demands, while others never returned.\n\nIt seems a part of the rebellious towns demand we invest into the regions through development projects. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."
 Y98_beikling_unification_title:0 "Beikling Pacification"
 Y98_beikling_unification_desc:0 "Some of the Beikling have started an open revolt against the state, their hilly lands making them difficult to fight. Some prominent figures have refused negotiation, but others have responded well to the reparations paid during the Daxugo Reform. The Beikling people are a divided one, a portion of the populace being fiercely loyal to us as we have aided many in their liberation from the Horned Ogres. Others yet still cling to the days of Azjakuma or the teachings of the Devouring Path. Others still remember the razing of Jinqiu and Jincheng. Thus their demands are as fractured as their people, the only common thread we could discover was that they all desired gainful employment. As such we have agreed to aid some locals in establishing workshops. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."
 Y98_jiangszun_unification_title:0 "Jiangszun Pacification"
 Y98_jiangszun_unification_desc:0 "As our emissaries make their way up and down the Yanhe, bringing word back from local nobility in some of the richest cities in Haless, the situation is clear: the locals have seen a sharp decline in trade since our conquest and they demand independence or large investments into the region.\n\nTheir demands include repairing the Golden Highway, expanding markets, and clearing the river from rebel blockades. Some prominent figures have refused negotiation, and those will have to be dealt with. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."
 Y98_gangim_unification_title:0 "Gangim Pacification"
 Y98_gangim_unification_desc:0 "Our efforts to negotiate with the Gangim nobility has not been in vain, for we now have a large list of demands - some petty, some reasonable - and all of them expensive.\n\nA significant portion of the Gangim nobility will lay down arms and attempt to pacify their populace if we ensure their coasts are once again secure from pirates, the same agreement they made with the previous two empires that conquered them. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."
 Y98_naamjyut_unification_title:0 "Naamjyut Pacification"
 Y98_naamjyut_unification_desc:0 "The Naamjyut people care about a select few things: the right to their faith and being able to export their tea. As they view us as threatening both of these rights, many of the traditionalist nobles are thus unwilling to negotiate.\n\nThe ones that are willing demand a few things: they want to diversify their production economy with Lupulan rainforest lumber and want the state to aid in the acquiring of the saplings, which the Yanglam try to maintain a monopoly on. Perhaps we can placate the old guard by improving their tea yields. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."
 Y98_szitu_unification_title:0 "Szitu Incorporation?"
 Y98_szitu_unification_desc:0 "If we are to unify all of the Yan people, we must destroy the Wulin and their Xiaken and incorporate the Szitu into our realm - let us stake our claim."
 Y98_yan_unification_title:0 "Yan Unification"
 Y98_yan_unification_desc:0 "Uniting all the Yan in Yanshen under one banner has been the goal of our empire ever since its foundation. None may harm our people, none may disturb our empire. We are Daxugo, father of all Yan."
 Y98_inward_perfection_title:0 "Inward Perfection"
 Y98_inward_perfection_desc:0 "With The Maskbreaker Rebellion behind us, it is now time for a period of reform, a period of calm and inward perfection.\n\nLet us stabilize our grasp upon the Yan, fortify our borders, reform our military, bolster our economy, and rework our laws and institutions."
 Y98_great_daxugo_legal_code_title:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code"
 Y98_great_daxugo_legal_code_desc:0 "The Yan people have as many sets of laws as they have surnames. Before us lies the seemingly insurmountable task of unifying all these people under one great book of law.\n\nThe Great Daxugo Legal Code must be familiar to all Yan, yet serve Daxugo foremost. Let us start by establishing a definition of a citizen and setting up racial laws."
 Y98_articles_on_government_title:0 "Articles On Government"
 Y98_articles_on_government_desc:0 "The advisors of the realm have constantly been bothering [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] about details like local autonomy, representation of citizenry, nobility, and clans. It seems we cannot continue writing our laws before first establishing how the state itself will function."
 Y98_war_and_faith_title:0 "War Codified"
 Y98_war_and_faith_desc:0 "If [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has learned anything during these formative months, it is that the codes on war conduct have the potential to tear our great Diguó in two, much like the time of the Maskbreaker Rebellion.\n\nThe traditional Dìguómáo of the steppes demand the military law be written according to our ancient ways, whilst the National Academy based in Jianshu has many influential members arguing for quite the opposite."
 Y98_faith_code_title:0 "Faith Codified"
 Y98_faith_code_desc:0 "The time has come to incorporate our religious convictions into the very constitution of our great nation. Such laws can aid either in rooting out hostile faiths, or ensuring our subjects feel represented, regardless of belief."
 Y98_daxugo_unshaken_title:0 "Daxugo Unshaken"
 Y98_daxugo_unshaken_desc:0 "We have come out of this period of unrest stronger than ever, our state reformed, away from all troublesome horde heritage, but holding on to what keeps us strong."
 Y98_outward_gaze_title:0 "Outward Gaze"
 Y98_outward_gaze_desc:0 "Our state is now in such a position where most issues inherent to our historical predicaments have been solved, and as such we can no longer be content with just our new homeland.\n\nOur state hungers for expansion, our mages hunger for artifacts, and our generals wish to prove themselves across Halann. It is time to gaze outward, like a true empire."
 Y98_draft_military_reforms_title:0 "Plan Military Reforms"
 Y98_draft_military_reforms_desc:0 "A board of advisors, reformers, architects and logistical experts will have to be carefully formed and curated so they may provide us with solid plans to reform our military and defenses."
 Y98_big_yellow_birds_title:0 "Terrorbird Consolidation"
 Y98_big_yellow_birds_desc:0 "The Shuvüüsh people have kept the terrorbirds in their families for centuries, ensuring the sons who ride them are well trained, but a negative side effect is that there is less exchange of knowledge and technology.\n\nAs such some families use different equipment, maneuvers, and even breeds of terrorbird. To consolidate their teachings and make birdriding available for men showing talent but lacking funds, we should establish state sponsored schools in the steppe."
 Y98_haisosen_birdrider_academy_title:0 "Terrorbird Academy"
 Y98_haisosen_birdrider_academy_desc:0 "The Daxug and Shuvüüsh have been teaching the ways of the terrorbird for over one and a half thousand years. This is often a decentralized process where fathers teach sons or village tutors teach the sons worthy enough to ride one of the fierce beasts.\n\nIt has however become evident that if the birdriders are to stay a part of our military in a time where cavalry is becoming less prominent, we shall have to teach them new strategies to approach, flank, and disengage. To this end we should establish a university to centralize the teaching process."
 Y98_national_army_academy_title:0 "Daxugo Army Academy"
 Y98_national_army_academy_desc:0 "The city of Jiangdu has been the home of countless warlords and is home to some of the most fierce bloodlines of Yan generals. Several small scale general schools already exist in the city, but a step forward would be to build a true military academy to train both soldiers and generals together, in the city of warlords.\n\nThis academy will be a modern one and a counterbalance to the power of the Dìguómáo of the north. With this academy we can train all our willing men and house our military personnel in a central location."
 Y98_tsaicun_national_stockpile_title:0 "Szicheng Stockpile"
 Y98_tsaicun_national_stockpile_desc:0 "The city of Szicheng is situated in an excellent position to function as the location of the main stockpile of our mainland military. It is rougly in the middle of the Yanhe, has ample access to the salt of Sising and the fish of lake Tianhu. At the same time it supports seemingly endless fields of crops around the city walls. It is a true hub of all the realms foodstuffs, only rivaled by Yanzhong and Duzhekho, but in a better position to send supplies westward. Let us construct the biggest storage of Haless."
 Y98_plugging_the_holes_title:0 "Plugging The Holes"
 Y98_plugging_the_holes_desc:0 "If our state is going to stand the tests of time, we must ensure that any war fought to preserve ourselves is undertaken with as many advantages as possible. To this end we should ensure that our forts cover all angles of minor angles of approach, so we can afterwards focus on the main angle, the West-Yanshen border."
 Y98_the_yanshen_wall_title:0 "West-Yanshen Wall"
 Y98_the_yanshen_wall_desc:0 "With the minor holes in the border of our mainland plugged, it is time to focus on our western lands. Regardless of whether it is deemed necessary right now, it will no doubt be a vital investment in the long run: A great line of forts along the West-Yanshen border, from the Demon Hills to Bianfang and from Bianfang to the Phokhao Range."
 Y98_city_line_title:0 "Yanhe City Line"
 Y98_city_line_desc:0 "The great cities of the Yanhe are home to the plurality of our subjects - no river in the world has more people along it, as far as we know. We should make sure these cities are all fortified in such a way that they can not easily fall into enemy hands, whilst also ensuring enemy supply lines are disrupted, should they attempt to cross over the main vein of our empire."
 Y98_steppe_line_title:0 "The Steppe Line"
 Y98_steppe_line_desc:0 "The temples in Zougzengom require protection from foreign invaders, and the great city of Jiantsiang could use likewise protection, through the hills of Lipshu. Let us create a northern line to ensure our empire has one more line of forts to call upon in times of need."
 Y98_draft_economic_reforms_title:0 "Plan Economic Reforms"
 Y98_draft_economic_reforms_desc:0 "A board of well-funded and carefully selected economic advisors is necessary to draft plans that will prepare our economy for the ever-changing future."
 Y98_increase_tea_production_title:0 "Increase Tea Production"
 Y98_increase_tea_production_desc:0 "Some resources and products are very scarce in our land; tea is not one of them. Whatever tea we do not drink ourselves - and we drink a lot - always finds willing buyers abroad.\n\nIf we wish to establish ourselves forever as the main tea producers of the world, some investments are in order."
 Y98_reform_gold_standard_title:0 "The Gold Reforms"
 Y98_reform_gold_standard_desc:0 "Gold is an incredibly valuable resource; it adorns our temples, beautifies our regalia, and is used as a secondary currency throughout the realm. This last fact is a problem however, according to some of the most prominent economic advisors.\n\nInflation related to trading in an ever increasing supply in gold will continue to decrease the trust in our currencies and devalue our monetary systems. It is time to regulate the trading in gold and form new laws to halt inflation."
 Y98_expand_sugarfarms_title:0 "Expand Sugarfarms"
 Y98_expand_sugarfarms_desc:0 "Unlike tea, sugar is a resource often imported into our realm from abroad, as the only significant sugar producing region in our realm are the cane fields of Lamcue. We should attempt to expand these fields with government stimulus and also spread these canes through the realm, so other regions may begin cultivating this valuable resource as well."
 Y98_silk_road_title:0 "The Silk Road"
 Y98_silk_road_desc:0 "Our grasp on the silk market is a tight one; only the sericulture of Sramaya in Bhuvauri can hope to compete in both quality and quantity. Our nobility wears silk exclusively grown near the Yanhe, yet other nobles in Haless shamefully wear robes of low quality imitations or even cloth and wool.\n\nLet us elevate the entire continent to a higher state of fashion by bolstering our production and spreading word of our silk to far lands, across the ancient road of Jaher."
 Y98_anti_corruption_reforms_title:0 "Corruption Reforms"
 Y98_anti_corruption_reforms_desc:0 "Our administration consists of many different peoples: Daxug, Gowon, Yan and even Harimari fill posts in our administration. All the different languages, offices, and laws of the past have caused a corruption problem.\n\nIf we are to rid ourselves of this problem for good, we must infiltrate our own administrators and carve out the rotten parts with diligence."
 Y98_expand_the_bureaucracy_title:0 "Expand The Bureaucracy"
 Y98_expand_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our empire has grown substantially in the last few centuries. We have come a long way, from tents to palaces and from village elders to courthouses. We should modernize our administrative process so we can administer more land effectively."
 Y98_war_tax_reform_title:0 "War Tax Reforms"
 Y98_war_tax_reform_desc:0 "In times of war, our people are often subjected to additional taxation, to fuel the war effort. This system is not uncommon around Haless, nor is the unrest that often comes along with it.\n\nA new system, where taxes are lowered in times of peace, paired with propaganda and new laws, can hopefully allow our army to be funded without riling up the citizenry or requiring soldiers to go door to door to collect war taxes."
 Y98_propaganda_reform_title:0 "Propaganda Reform"
 Y98_propaganda_reform_desc:0 "Our state has gone through multiple periods of unrest. Such periods may and should never happen anymore. To this end we should ensure the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] is a beacon of stability and legitimacy, with every fact about them reaching the populace only after having gone through a team of expert advisors."

 ### Events
 daxugo.1.t:0 "Orc Shock Troops"
 daxugo.1.d:0 "With the Brown Orcs now roaming Rahen without a realm to represent and protect them, they are beginning to seek refuge within a variety of states. One such roaming clan has asked us if it can gain employment in our military.\n\nShall we allow them to serve on our front lines?"
 daxugo.1.a:0 "They shall make fine frontline support companies for our infantry"
 daxugo.1.b:0 "They will only destabilize our military"
 daxugo.2.t:0 "The Fanwang System"
 daxugo.2.d:0 "The land of Yanshen is ours, but its people sometimes do not see us as their rightful masters. As such it is imperative that the many regions of our realm are administered locally by trustworthy Daxug. In tradition with ancient Shuvüüsh code, the land shall be carved up into a neo-clan structure, which will placate the many shuvüüsh clans of old whose leaders have now been uplifted into the nobility. These clans form local administrations, collect taxes and suppress revolts.\n\nThe land will be divided according to inheritance, history, ancient claims and participation in recent conquests.\n\nFor example: \nGowon and the lands directly west of it shall fall under the Fanwang of the Rüng Igedch family.\nThere are countless clans, but every major clan is already sending representatives to [Root.Capital.GetName] to stake their claim.\n\n§RCheck the province modifiers of areas to discover what clans are administering what regions, each one bringing their own modifier.§!"
 daxugo.2.a:0 "Far better than those eunuchs!"
 daxugo.30.t:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code: Tax Laws"
 daxugo.30.d:0 "Should tax be collected based upon the value of the land held by the citizen or on the value of goods produced and sold?\n\nThis question has ripped the council in half, the former option being beneficial for the people of the great cities and more in line with the laws of the Yan, but the latter benefiting the people of the countryside and being more in line with the ways of the Shuvüüsh of old."
 daxugo.30.a:0 "Favor the cities"
 daxugo.30.b:0 "Favor the countryside"
 daxugo.31.t:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code: Races and Citizenship"
 daxugo.31.d:0 "What constitutes a citizen? Can an orc be a citizen? If so, should he have the same rights and punishments as a human does? Is that justice or injustice? What if the orc shamans wish for harsher punishments for their criminals than we do? Should an elf prison sentence be weighted the same as that of a human, in spite of the differences in lifespan? Should the harimari get citizenship? They have proven without a doubt to be an asset to the administration, but some humans still have a bad aftertaste from Harimar's conquest. \n\nMany people from the big cities see granting citizenship to all as a way forward, with the establishment of local councils with representation from every race to handle all nuances of a multi-racial empire as a way to avoid conflicts. People hailing from traditionally human communities such as the Szitu, Shuvüüsh and peoples who suffered greatly at the hand of non-humans see this idea as absurd and urge [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to limit the rights given to non-humans."
 daxugo.31.b:0 "All races should be granted the opportunity of citizenship."
 daxugo.31.c:0 "Daxugo is an empire of humans first and foremost."
 daxugo.32.t:0 "Non-Humans Rebel"
 daxugo.32.d:0 "The non-humans of our realm were not at all pleased with our decision to define a citizen as a human. All across the empire, harimari, kobolds, and even ogres and goblins demand equal representation."
 daxugo.32.a:0 "This only proves their inferiority once more"
 daxugo.33.t:0 "Human Prejudiced Rebels"
 daxugo.33.d:0 "The people of the western reaches of our realm, who have fought endless wars against the orcs and hobgoblins, did not at all take kindly to our decision to give citizenship to non-humans. They have risen up in rebellion and are purging any non-humans they can find, avoiding non-human strongholds, refusing to stand down unless we sign prejudiced laws."
 daxugo.33.a:0 "Damn them!"
 daxugo.34.t:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code: Deliberative Assembly"
 daxugo.34.d:0 "With the Great Daxugo Legal Code taking form, we are working away the last bits of our institutionalized horde legacy. As old systems are modernized or replaced completely, we find ourselves at yet another crossroads. Our advisors have observed states from all across Halann and have come up with four ways to represent the people, now that village elder is nothing more than an honorary title.\n\nParliamentarism would empower our cities by granting them local representation, but the abolishment of the privileges of the nobility, followed by their incorporation into the parliament is likely to ruffle some feathers."
 daxugo.34.a:0 "Parliamentarism"
 daxugo.34.b:0 "Royal Decree"
 daxugo.34.c:0 "Aristocratic Court"
 daxugo.34.e:0 "General Estates"
 daxugo.35.t:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code: Degree of Centralisation"
 daxugo.35.d:0 "Whether we entrench the Diguó system and move towards a centralized absolutist state or incorporate the clan laws of Baduum - dating back to the steppes - into the legal code is a heavy point of debate. Some advisors argue for centralisation as a way to increase tax revenue and cement the position of the Diguó, whilst others see a return of the Baduum system as a way to open up diplomatic possibilities and delegate hard to rule peoples to local rulers."
 daxugo.35.a:0 "Centralisation is the way forward"
 daxugo.35.b:0 "The ways of old brought us here"
 daxugo.36.t:0 "Nobles Resist Parliamentarism"
 daxugo.36.d:0 "Nobles across the realm have revoked their trust in the Diguó over the incorporation of the nobility into the parliament. They claim it is a gross violation of ancient laws and that such actions severely damage the hard earned privileges of the nobility. They demand the immediate abolishment of the parliament and the establishment of an aristocratic court."
 daxugo.36.a:0 "Nobles always complain"
 daxugo.37.t:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code: War Conduct"
 daxugo.37.d:0 "Our military is at a crossroads - the way men make their way into the army now consists of two entirely separate pipelines. The traditionalist Dìguómáo of the north draft based on heritage and family lines, and constitute of roughly a quarter of the military.\n\nThe more progressive pipeline in Yanshen selects based on talent; the officials of that faction now wish to curtail the privileges of the Dìguómáo because their raiding is damaging the logistics and reputation of the army. The Dìguómáo of the steppes, our noble caste of warriors, traditionally consisting of spearmen and birdriders who trace their lineage back to the Shuvüüsh of old, stand firmly against the reforms proposed by the council of the Daxugo Army Academy in Jianshu.\n\nThe Dìguómáo warriors of the north demand we integrate their rights to raiding into the legal code and make the birdriders a more prominent part of the military. The Jianshu Military Council, which represents the more modern segment of our military, consists of prominent generals and Yan military advisors. They demand that we restrict looting to a minimum and modernize our military away from the terrorbirds, who they describe as archaic. They instead wish to increase spending on artillery. Whichever side we please, grudges will be forged today."
 daxugo.37.a:0 "Please The Dìguómáo"
 daxugo.37.b:0 "Please The Academy"
 daxugo.38.t:0 "Academy Coup"
 daxugo.38.d:0 "The Council of the Daxugo Military Academy in Jianshu has revoked their trust in our government following our unwillingness to modernize the army and curtail the privileges of the Dìguómáo, taking a large amount of our manpower reserves and regiments in training with them, in a march on [Root.Capital.GetName]. They demand we ratify their previous proposals to the Great Daxugo Legal Code."
 daxugo.38.a:0 "The Yanhe will flow red"
 daxugo.39.t:0 "Dìguómáo Coup"
 daxugo.39.d:0 "The Dìguómáo are furious at our attempt to curtail their privileges and have raised several hosts from the steppe to change our mind... forcefully."
 daxugo.39.a:0 "A heavy blow for our military"
 daxugo.40.t:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code: Religious Rights"
 daxugo.40.d:0 "Shall the great state of Daxugo proclaim a mandatory faith, a decree of tolerance of heresies, or even a decree of complete tolerance? This question has been on everyone's minds today. Advisors squabble back and forth over the ramifications for the stability of the realm, and what the gods would think."
 daxugo.40.a:0 "All faiths are welcome in our lands"
 daxugo.40.b:0 "Only faiths compatible with ours are welcome"
 daxugo.40.c:0 "It is time for a new age of conversions"
 daxugo.41.t:0 "Heathen Backlash"
 daxugo.41.d:0 "With the incorporation of the code stating that all faiths that are fundamentally incompatible with ours will be outlawed, many took to the streets in anger. Rebellions are spreading over this new law, which rebels claim goes against what our realm and our faith stands for."
 daxugo.41.a:0 "Ready the military"
 daxugo.42.t:0 "Heretic & Heathen Backlash"
 daxugo.42.d:0 "With the incorporation of the code stating that all faiths that are divergent from ours will be outlawed, many took to the streets in anger. Rebellions are spreading over this new law, which rebels claim goes against what our realm and our faith stands for."

 daxugo.50.d:0 "With [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] winning the Hekuudzoungh tournament, millions of the realms subjects are once again reminded of the supremacy of Daxugo, its ruler and the Daxug culture as tales of the martial feats displayed during the tournament spread throughout the nation. As millions enjoy the fireworks, street parades and food stemming from the weeklong festivities throughout the realm that accompany the tournament, even the most remote youths are exposed to Daxug culture."
 daxugo.50.a:0 "Daxugo Forever"
 daxugo.51.t:0 "Our Heir [Root.Heir.GetName] Inspires Millions"
 daxugo.51.d:0 "With Heir [Root.Heir.GetName] winning the Hekuudzoungh tournament, millions of the realms subjects are once again reminded of the supremacy of Daxugo, its heir and the Daxug culture as tales of the martial feats displayed during the tournament spread throughout the nation. As millions enjoy the fireworks, street parades and food stemming from the weeklong festivities throughout the realm that accompany the tournament, even the most remote youths are exposed to Daxug culture."
 daxugo.51.a:0 "Daxugo Forever"
 daxugo.59.t:0 "Rebellion And Compromise"
 daxugo.59.d:0 "As our new administrative structure begins to take shape it is becoming painfully obvious that the Yan we have subjugated have not yet come to terms with their new overlords. Reports of small scale revolts are spreading through the country, with organized sabotage disrupting our logistics. Some rebels seem to be organizing around the symbol of a shattered mask, if rumors on the street are to be believed.\n\nVarious factions have sent demands to our government, radicals say there will be bloodshed unless we grant them independence, whilst the Yan nobles and guilds put forth more agreeable, yet expensive demands. Our administrative advisors have tried to compile an exhaustive list of demands made by the somewhat more reasonable Yan factions, theorizing that our empire might fall like Guwaamud of old if we do not begin preparing for civil strife immediately. Daxug generals and advisors agree that meeting the demands of certain factions is fruitful, but that malcontents will rise regardless, simply because we are seen as a foreign conqueror. Starting to work towards meeting the demands now that we still live in a time of relative peace will no doubt help our future administration in calming down the expected period of unrest when [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] passes away."
 daxugo.59.a:0 "I'm getting a headache…"
 daxugo.60.t:0 "Dining On The Yanhe"
 daxugo.60.d:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has invited [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and close friends to a party on the Yanhe, in celebration of his birthday. As the sun begins to set, the party changes from a formal dinner into a more relaxed festive mood. Guests start to get exceedingly drunk and the boat is about to turn back downstream, to return to [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThat is when they strike, from several riverside huts along the river - boats are pushed into the water, a few Dìguómáo guards are shot down by carefully aimed arrows, whilst a cannon shoots at the main ship from a window of one of the houses, killing several guests. As several guard ships break away from the party ship to deal with the assailants, a handful of men who had been hiding in the water climb aboard, drenched in water and rage.\n\nThey begin shouting to each other in Yan, with a thick Jiangszun accent, about where [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] might be. As the Dìguómáo aboard the ship surround the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the court mage begins a warding spell, another cannon shot is heard..."
 daxugo.60.a:0 "I hate the Jiangszun and they hate me"
 daxugo.61.t:0 "Egg Sabotage!"
 daxugo.61.d:0 "A shocking report has reached the capital: Thousands of terrorbird eggs have been smashed! Apparently a group of Yan have traveled to the steppes and over the course of several weeks have been raiding terrorbird breeding farms.\n\nThe Dìguómáo have caught and executed most, after painful interrogations. Both the interrogations and the tattoos on their bodies seem to indicate they were part of a Jiangyang splinter group of the Maskbreakers, one of the primary groups of anti-Daxugo Yan rebels."
 daxugo.61.a:0 "I hate the Jiangyang and they hate me"
 daxugo.62.t:0 "Death And Taxes"
 daxugo.62.d:0 "Rumors have been spreading through our administration: Naamjyut rebels have been killing any tax collector who sets foot in one of their forests. Early reports show this to be true; we have lost dozens of tax collectors, and worse yet our entire administration is filled with fear.\n\nThe forest rebels have been carving their symbol into the chests of the government employees they kill: a broken Saanorgegh mask."

 daxugo.63.d:0 "Multiple ships which have docked at Feiten have reported the same things: missing equipment, suspicious fires, stolen documents, price hikes for government employees, and holes carved into the bottom of their ships. Especially state-owned ships and those with Daxug captains seem to be getting hit hard.\n\nRumor has it that there is a local gang behind these sabotages, calling themselves Maskdrowners."
 daxugo.63.a:0 "I hate the Gangim and they hate me"
 daxugo.64.t:0 "Beikling Hexing"
 daxugo.64.d:0 "When reports from our armies all included torrential rainfall and muddy camps for the second month in a row, it stopped being a coincidence. When it happened a third time, it became clear we were being hexed by powerful mages.\n\nOur mages casted protective spells and tried to divine the curses’ source, quickly realizing they came from the Beikling. Further investigation has shown that there is a vast network of Devouring Path mage circles spread out through the hilly lands, all united under a single banner, calling themselves the Maskhexers.\n\nOur mages and special units of the Dìguómáo are hunting down these circles, but it might take a while."
 daxugo.64.a:0 "I hate the Beikling and they hate me"
 daxugo.65.t:0 "The Maskbreaker Rebellion"
 daxugo.65.d:0 "Whilst our previous ruler, who is now guiding the Daxug people from their throne in the spirit realm, managed to subjugate the Yan and suppress their opposition to our regime by fear and the fresh memory of their conquest alone, our new monarch [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] does not have these advantages.\n\nAs the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] began [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule, it became very clear that the Yan were not pacified; they were merely biding their time. The various Maskbreaker factions thwart our government at every opportunity. All across Daxugo, calls to rebellion from disloyal peoples are spreading like a fire on the steppe, turning larger and larger.\n\nWill [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] overcome this period of unrest or will the realm collapse like that of ancient Guwaamud?"
 daxugo.65.a:0 "I will not falter"
 daxugo.66.t:0 "Purged And Pacified"
 daxugo.66.d:0 "With the majority of the Yan people punished for their crimes against peace and order we are approaching the end of an era of unrest. With local leaders either executed and replaced by puppets or placated by meeting their demands, we have convinced the majority of the previously rebellious peoples to stop throwing their sons onto our spears.\n\nIt cost hundreds of thousands of lives to both our proud soldiers and our taxpayers, but in the end we came out on top."
 daxugo.66.a:0 "We must never let this happen again"
 daxugo.67.t:0 "New Month, New Rebellion"
 daxugo.67.d:0 "'If they resist their subjugation, make them regret it so much that all of Haless sees the smoke' -Nurgai Bagaatun, while mortal, to her generals.\n\nWith a new rebellion trying to crush our achievements, our riders ready their terrorbirds whilst our Dìguómáo polish their spears. A new battle is upon us."
 daxugo.67.a:0 "It is time to blow some smoke"
 daxugo.68.t:0 "Rünsukhi Loyalists Gather"
 daxugo.68.d:0 "When we first received word that the Rünsukhi wanted to aid us in our war, we dismissed their messages as they are relatively few in number. But when they said they could muster five thousand men, we naturally accepted."
 daxugo.68.a:0 "They shall form their own regiments"
 daxugo.69.t:0 "Daxug War Hero Volunteers"
 daxugo.69.d:0 "An old general, renowned across all of the realm, has traveled to Duzhekho to join the military. He doesn't walk very well anymore and his retirement in the countryside betrays his Shuvüüsh accent in our Daxug military. However, he is an invaluable asset to the war effort. How shall we use him?"
 daxugo.69.a:0 "Accept him as a general"
 daxugo.69.b:0 "Have him travel the land, urging men to enlist"
 daxugo.70.t:0 "Gowon Insurgency"
 daxugo.70.d:0 "As our armies are occupied with the southern reaches of our realm, the Gowon have used this opportunity to rise up and try for independence! Luckily they are far less ferocious in their rebellion than the Yan. However, a lot of food for the army is cultivated in this region, making this insurgency have a negative impact on our supply lines."
 daxugo.70.a:0 "We should send a force to deal with them"
 daxugo.72.t:0 "A Moment Of Weakness"
 daxugo.72.d:0 "With our archnemesis Daxugo embroiled in a grand civil war, now would be the time to strike!"
 daxugo.72.a:0 "We aren't ready"
 daxugo.72.b:0 "It is time"
 daxugo.73.t:0 "The Rebellion Hurts Our Agriculture."
 daxugo.73.d:0 "The rebellion is destroying our crops! The need to fight keeps farmers away from their fields, while the fruits of their labour are being plundered by bandits and the enemy. In a normal war we could prevent the worst by using the surplus of unravaged provinces, but now this system is breaking down as the entire country is taking sides, spreading combat everywhere and creating a situation where villages don't know which side their neighbours are a part of."
 daxugo.73.a:0 "Why can't the peasants eat cake?"
 daxugo.73.b:0 "Just import food from abroad."
 daxugo.73.c:0 "Someone must be hoarding food, we must seize it."
 daxugo.74.t:0 "Our Soldiers Desert"
 daxugo.74.d:0 "The hardships of war and destruction of our grain surplus has led many a civilian to abandon their homes. With no end in sight, our soldiers are also starting to desert in large droves."
 daxugo.74.a:0 "Let them go"
 daxugo.74.b:0 "Increase their pay"
 daxugo.74.c:0 "Our soldiers need the food more than our peasantry"
 daxugo.75.t:0 "Rebel Army Leader Captured"
 daxugo.75.d:0 "We have routed one of the rebel armies and in the process, have captured a group of noble instigators. Even now, many of the children are crying while the men and women alike beg for mercy and leniency. How shall we respond to their pleas?"
 daxugo.75.a:0 "Pardon them"
 daxugo.75.b:0 "Execute them and loot their holdings"
 daxugo.77.t:0 "The Maskbreaker Rebellion"
 daxugo.77.d:0 "A large rebellion has broken out in Daxugo, with various ethnicities fighting for independence. We could try helping the rebels in order to weaken them, but if they end up losing this might strain our relations."
 daxugo.77.a:0 "Send some unruly subjects to the rebels as 'volunteers'."
 daxugo.77.b:0 "Give the rebels some monetary aid."
 daxugo.77.c:0 "We don't help rebel scum."
 daxugo.78.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Intervention"
 daxugo.78.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has sent help to the traitorous rebels, sponsoring a significant uprising near their border."
 daxugo.78.a:0 "We will not forget this."
 daxugo.79.t:0 "Administrative Advisor Betrayal"
 daxugo.79.d:0 "We took a risk when we hired [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] as our administrative advisor, having grown up in one of the cultures currently embroiled in the rebellion against our state.\n\nAs it turns out it was a wrong bet, as [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has now disappeared with some of our documents, funds, and pride."
 daxugo.79.a:0 "They cannot be trusted."
 daxugo.80.t:0 "Diplomatic Advisor Betrayal"
 daxugo.80.d:0 "We took a risk when we hired [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] as our diplomatic advisor, having grown up in one of the cultures currently embroidered in the rebellion against our state.\n\nAs it turns out it was a wrong bet, as [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] has now disappeared with some of our documents, funds, and pride."
 daxugo.80.a:0 "They cannot be trusted."
 daxugo.81.t:0 "Military Advisor Betrayal"
 daxugo.81.d:0 "We took a risk when we hired [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] as our military advisor, having grown up in one of the cultures currently embroidered in the rebellion against our state.\n\nAs it turns out it was a wrong bet, as [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] has now disappeared with some of our documents, funds, and pride."
 daxugo.81.a:0 "They cannot be trusted."
 daxugo.82.t:0 "Harimari Loyalists"
 daxugo.82.d:0 "As our government has been kind to the previous conquerors of this land, the Harimari, some of them have also been kind to us. As they see our empire go through the very rebellions that they went through, they guide us with old lessons and bring relief to our state with their vast treasuries, no doubt to ask for favors later."
 daxugo.82.a:0 "Their help is most welcome"
 daxugo.82.b:0 "We are not in a position to refuse"
