 A16_protect_toarnaire_title:0 "Protect Toarnaire"
 A16_protect_toarnaire_desc:0 "While we smartly remained neutral in the Fourth Lilac War, that does not mean that the aftermath of that bloody conflict leaves us unaffected. Our privileged position as the premier port in the Bay of Wines may protect us for now, but the same cannot be said for our vassal in Toarnaire. Their position is a vulnerable one, made even worse by a victorious and revanchist Lorent now bordering them.\n\nWe must rectify this situation. Several military-minded members of the Council of Seventy Chalices have come to us with a simple proposal - we fund the construction of a fort in Toarnaire, making sure that it can hold out if the worst comes to pass, offering us the time to form an alliance capable of contesting the attack. Several of our merchants and Wine Barons have offered to cover half the costs, seeking to protect their own investments, meaning we have only to cover the other half to see this project realised."

 A16_an_imperial_connection_title:0 "An Imperial Connection"
 A16_an_imperial_connection_desc:0 "With Toarnaire now securely under our thumb, several of the merchants of Wineport have raised attention to an important fact that we can now properly consider - Toarnaire’s membership of the Empire. Our merchants have requested that we expand Toarnaire’s capabilities in this regard, seeing as it serves as a way for our goods to enter the Empire while avoiding many pesky tariffs. But, it does raise the question - why don’t we use this Imperial link to join the Empire ourselves?\n\nOf course, such a possibility does not come without considerations. It would grant us the protection of the Emperor, always a boon when one lives next to Lorent, and allow us to avoid the customs barriers that lessen our penetration of the Anbennarian market. However, it does mean answering to the Emperor and likely some other annoying obligations, like imperial taxes. Let us consider our options, and see where we stand."

 A16_trading_rights_title:0 "Imperial Trading Rights"
 A16_trading_rights_desc:0 "Whether we are in the Empire now or not, it is still an extremely lucrative market - one in which the nobility always has a demand for goods as fine as ours. For what noble can truly hold a feast or ball without a bottomless supply of wine with which to keep their guests entertained? Not any noble in the League, surely, and we should make it so that no noble in the Empire of Anbennar may either.\n\nTo further this effort, and to avoid any problems from the empire's own traders in Damescrown and Beepeck, we should worm our way in directly via the Emperor. We shall send our diplomats to woo them, and offer an investment in some Imperial institution or other to get our luxuries into their market."

 A16_the_pearl_gambit_title:0 "The Pearl Gambit"
 A16_the_pearl_gambit_desc:0 "Every Wine Baron who now trades along our increasingly influential network within the Empire cites one complaint above all - the Pearlsedgers and their damn toll. They use many colourful terms to express their displeasure, but the main point is simply that it is bad for business. This situation must change if we want to successfully exploit- I mean, promote free and fair bargains for our goods without absurd taxes placed upon us.\n\nWe are not the only party who suffers from the Pearlsedgers and their tolls, as the Empire’s own traders also complain loudly about them as well. Some of our barons believe that we should get in contact with them and propose new owners for The Pearls - us. That way, we can expand our business in the Empire, remove the tolls, and make everyone happy. …but especially us."

 A16_promises_are_promises_title:0 "Promises are Promises"
 A16_promises_are_promises_desc:0 "It is done - we own the Pearls and hold the entrance to the Dameshead! The tyranny of Pearlsedge’s tolls is finally vanquished. Our Wine Barons are already enjoying the sight of one dismantled toll, and now they think - if we can smash down one barrier for our merchants, why not the other at the Damesteeth? Plans are already being drawn up for extending our influence over the next island chain, thus liberating the Empire from their tolls and bringing wine to all.\n\nOf course, there is another possibility… our merchants now go toll-free, of course, but what about the Imperial merchants? We did promise we would remove the tolls for them as well, but looking over the numbers of the money the toll makes, perhaps they’re not so bad - properly administered, that is under the wise jurisdiction of the League of Winebay… let us think on the matter further."

 A16_merchant_port_title:0 "Merchant Ports"
 A16_merchant_port_desc:0 "Neckcliffe now has a new master. While they must still technically answer to the Emperor, the League of Winebay is their immediate ruler now. Our flag flies alongside theirs in the port, stamping our authority over it. And what boons this authority brings! The Wine Barons are already proudly boasting of their new profit margins, trying to best one another for the lowest tax spent on a given volume of the purple stuff. The best so far is a Roilsardi merchant, now ducking Imperial taxes, Anbenncóst tariffs, and Beepeck taxes from another part of their business. All their wine of late goes through Neckcliffe, and our fortunes rise alongside this fact.\n\nAlongside being a friendly and cost-free port for our merchants, Neckcliffe can also serve as an asset in other ways, owing to its history as custodian of the Imperial fleet. We should raise the skilled officers and valuable institutions of their admiralty to be the leaders of their government, so as to better run the port and to make sure that our merchants can feel safe in their ventures from jealous rivals."

 A16_protect_the_divenhal_title:0 "Protect the Divenhal"
 A16_protect_the_divenhal_desc:0 "It is said that success breeds envy, and while our venerable League has, through hard work, seen much of the former, this has inspired a surprising amount of the latter.\n\nOur acquisition of Neckcliffe, while not strictly peaceful, has certainly enriched both parties. Even so our enemies within and without the city call us covetous, warmongering murderers, watering our vineyards with the blood of Neckcliffer children. Such rumours are cruel and untrue, but they put a shameful stain on our reputation. Lesser men would lash out against such rumours.\n\nBut we are not lesser men.\n\nAcross the Divenhal lies Akasik. It is an arid region, inhabited by heathens and gnolls, who have raided the southern coast of Lencenor for generations. For us to expand our markets south, we need a forward outpost. And, since Cannorian shipping has suffered a great deal at gnollish paws, we can strike a blow for them as well, thus silencing the wicked tongues that call us evil.\n\nIt is a good day when one can kill two gnolls with one stone."

 A16_across_the_southern_sea_title:0 "Across the Southern Sea"
 A16_across_the_southern_sea_desc:0 "Our outpost in Akasik is complete, and it is time to sail out towards brave new shores! Our navigators and cartographers have informed us that the region of Dao Nako is ideal for a trading post, with an abundance of timber and several deepwater harbours. The downside is that the entirety of the coastline is a godsforsaken marshland.\n\nA number of local villages exist, but they are almost universally isolated and travel largely by boat, thus there is no inland infrastructure worthy of the name. It is worth mentioning the wildlife as well, which are not to our tastes, in no small part because they seem to have a taste for us. Everything, from the smallest insect to the great hydra, wishes for nothing more than to take a bite out of us; a flattering but lethal behaviour.\n\nBe that as it may, for the League to grow its reach we must have a port. The marsh must be drained, the trees cut down, and a city worthy of Wineport must be erected in their place."

 A16_incursion_into_the_island_title:0 "Incursion into the Island"
 A16_incursion_into_the_island_desc:0 "With a naval presence in Dao Nako, we now have the means to send our fleets even further along the coasts of Sarhal. Of particular interest is the vast island of Fahvanosy, the supposed homeland of the halflings.\n\nWhen one travels, it is comforting to think that one brings a peace of home along. In similar vein, it warms our hearts to see the halfling people thrive here, half a world away from home. After all, the relations between us Lencori and the halflings have always been excellent. We rule, they serve, and all benefit.\n\nAs such, our merchants insist that we invade these islands, and put them under League protection. The island of Fahvanosy is fabulously wealthy, and sits on an enviable trade route, seemingly drawing wares from all of Sarhal and beyond. Besides, Halflings are poor soldiers at best, so it behoves us to ensure that we gain control of Fahvanosy, before a less benevolent sovereign does."

 A16_the_fahvanosy_campaign_title:0 "The Fahvanosy Campaign"
 A16_the_fahvanosy_campaign_desc:0 "Our Fahvanosy campaign is going well, and the locals have proven as incapable of resisting us as their kinsmen at home. But even as war makes the blood run hot, we must take steps to limit the devastation. The Fahvanosy are an industrious people, and if we are to make use of them, we must at least make a token effort to mend the scars of our conquest.\n\nAs such, let us undertake a project to develop the region of Fahvanosy we already control. Improved infrastructure will benefit our armies as they mop up what resistance remains. More importantly, better roads facilitate inland trade. From the road, to the harbour, the wealth of Fahvanosy will flow back to Lencenor.\n\nLast but not least, our spies claim that the Fahvanosy halflings do in fact have vintners and wine both. It is, however, somewhat rare, so acquiring this viticultural wonder is a priority. See it done."

 A16_open_the_lizard_markets_title:0 "Open the Lizard Markets"
 A16_open_the_lizard_markets_desc:0 "East of Fahvanosy, the southern coast of Sarhal bends north, giving way to a vast sea alive with trade. The most prolific of these traders are the lizardfolk, whose merchant ships remain a common sight in Fahvanosy. The lizardfolk seem quite varied, and while their language and culture seems at least similar, it is unclear to us if they are one race, or many.\n\nRegrettably, our enthusiasm in putting Fahvanosy under our protection seems to have alienated most of the lizardfolk merchants active there. As a result, they almost universally refuse to trade with us, and our trade in Sarhal past Fahvanosy has suffered as a result.\n\nThis is an insult to free trade in general, and to Wineport in particular. The homeland of the lizardfolk is an impenetrable jungle, but many of their greatest cities sit on the south coast of Sarhal, opulent beyond measure. If the current regime of these cities will not trade with us, we will simply install one that will."

 A16_sell_to_the_baashidi_title:0 "Sell to the Baashidi"
 A16_sell_to_the_baashidi_desc:0 "The Maabedi Sea is one of the great wonders of Halann. Look north, and the venturing merchant captain will see the waves break against the coast, the jungle rises against the sky like a endless green wall. Only rarely does a lizardfolk settlement break the verdure, the jungle giving way to cultivated lands and great temple cities, nestling along the coast like white pearls. Look south, and the captain will look into the heart of Uelos' Lament, the sea stretching on until it meets the horizon, an endless line of blue against blue.\n\nHowever, as one follows the coast, one will eventually reach the isthmus of Jasiir Jadid, a range of mountains connecting greater Sarhal to the peninsula of Ardimya. Ardimya is a desolate region, but it is populated, and the native Bashiidi are committed traders.. As such, we believe that an arrangement can be made; we gain access to their ports, and they gain access to our markets. Judging by the state of Ardimya, they are getting the better end of that deal."

 A16_seeking_support_title:0 "Seeking Support"
 A16_seeking_support_desc:0 "Lorent is resurgent - having won the Fourth Lilac War, it seeks to restore hegemony over its old domains, those that the Lorentish see as betraying them during the Lilac Wars as a whole. That includes us. It is a vengeance fuelled further by their own domestic Wine Lords, who see us and our Wine Barons as an affront to their supposed dominance in the wine business,mere pretenders to their supposed expertise in viticulture.\n\nPetty falsehoods aside, this is a serious threat to our continued independence. While we’ve been granted a stay of execution, due to Lorent having to get its own house in order and Rubenaire and Eilísin standing between them and us, it is not a position many in our country expect to last. As such, top priority has been placed on finding friends who may deter Lorentish aggression and come to our aid should they, or in fact anyone else, attack us. Ideally, this ally will be strong, reliable, and prefer our wines over Lorent’s."

 A16_international_recognition_title:0 "International Recognition"
 A16_international_recognition_desc:0 "With an ally secure, we can now think about other ways to justify our cause to wider Cannor, should Lorent come knocking. Others may say that words would be the best way to do this, but we know that the true way to a person’s heart is via a nice, lovely drink. And what do we have in abundance if not an astonishing amount of that?\n\nWine Barons are being encouraged to include the logo and name of the League of Winebay on the bottles and barrels they sell abroad, and to speak everywhere of the glories of Wineport and the threats it faces. This means that whenever any noble or leader is deep into their cups, they shall glance the next bottle’s label and think of us. Anything that gets in the way of them and their lovely, delicious wine will know the rage of the stymied drunk. And, well, even if it doesn’t work, it at least will increase our recognition Cannor-wide."

 A16_ties_to_toarnaire_title:0 "Ties to Toarnaire"
 A16_ties_to_toarnaire_desc:0 "Toarnaire has been a great boon to us over the last several years, serving as a friendly (and subservient) port by which our ships could enter the Empire and an outpost from which we could cover both coasts of the Bay of Wines, keeping a firm eye on all who enter its waters. It stands to reason that such benefits would only be enhanced if it were to be formally integrated into the League of Winebay.\n\nLet us bring Toarnaire in, and have it reap the benefits of being a core city of the League. It shall bring them increased trade, and no emperors or kings to answer to! And, of course, even more wine than they already have."

 A16_thoarned_vines_title:0 "Thorned Vines"
 A16_thoarned_vines_desc:0 "Our mastery of the lands of the Roilsardi people is now established. Though they may chafe under the League for now, they will come to enjoy the privileges and wealth our rule brings. Sooner, even, if we show that they can win genuine recognition for contributions to our nation. In this regard, let us see what there is to be lauded in their traditions - particularly their prowess at surviving in-between Lorent and Anbennar. And, of course, their wine.\n\nLooking from the Roilsardi vineyards at our new eastern frontier, one cannot help but peer over the border into Pearlsedge, see the vineyards stretching to the horizon. Perhaps we should continue moving the border eastward, until all those vineyards are under our jurisdiction?"

 A16_roilsardi_military_minds_title:0 "Roilsardi Military Minds"
 A16_roilsardi_military_minds_desc:0 "While we are at this point no slouches in the matters of warfare, it is something that we wouldn’t necessarily consider our strong suit - we are not called ‘Swordsport’, after all! Nevertheless, it is something that a nation such as ours must always invest in if we wish to see our interests protected and our lands grow. With this in mind, our new Roilsardi subjects offer us an opportunity to improve our land forces with their experiences.\n\nLiving under constant threat of Lorentish aggression, they have developed highly effective strategies for anti-cavalry warfare, aimed at blunting the famous Lorentish knights and their charges. The majority of their captains and generals are more than acquainted with Lorent and have grown to have rather a distaste for the country - much like ourselves. Let us bring these people on board, and have our soldiers drill in Roilsardi tactics!"

 A16_imperial_vintage_title:0 "Imperial 'Vintage'"
 A16_imperial_vintage_desc:0 "As far as the eye can see, vineyards stretch across the countryside - and they are all ours. Our ports on both sides of the Bay of Wines flow with the drink: red, white and other types besides, both into the mouths of the Wine Barons, and into barrels and bottles to be shipped abroad, usually to Anbennar. But, it is with the latter that we could perhaps improve our position even further.\n\nWhether we are in the Empire or not, we are still something of a stranger to its customs, treated as foreigners interloping in an Anbennarian court, only seeking to sell our goods to as many people as possible. This makes many in the ports unfriendly to our merchants, messing them around with bureaucracy, and Gods forbid, taxes. So, why don’t we simply make ourselves a friendly port? Neckcliffe, only a stone’s throw away from our latest frontier, is a large existing harbour that would be perfect as one through which our merchants could enter the Empire without issue. Let us make that happen, and introduce Neckcliffe to the wonders of cheap wine! It shall make their loss of independence go down easier, at any rate."

 A16_colonies_of_minar_title:0 "Colonies of Minar"
 A16_colonies_of_minar_desc:0 "Minara is a god held close to our heart in the Winebay, for Minara is a good friend to wine. The outrageously decadent parties the temples of Minar regularly throw would not be possible without a great amount of booze to go with it, and our Wine Barons are more than happy to provide - as long as they get invited to all of them too. This has only been improved with the addition of Minara’s Succor to our wine collection, and has caused us to be approached with some feelers by the Minaran Temple from Minar… the less exciting type of feelers, unfortunately.\n\nThey are interested in expanding the spread of Minara’s love to Aelantir, and seek our patronage for such efforts. While they get to teach the Ruinborn and other settlers of the benefits of lesser love, we would financially benefit - as a share of the profits from their temples and vineyards would go directly into our coffers. Hearing the opportunity of more people enjoying Minara AND more wine has the members of our court eager to take them up on their offer, and expand our interests into Aelantir."

 A16_bloody_teeth_title:0 "Bloody Teeth"
 A16_bloody_teeth_desc:0 "We have taken the Pearls, and now we control the Damesteeth. Another toll is removed for Winebay merchants - hurrah! This time, we come face to face with the origins of the tolls, the Silmunas who once controlled these isles. They instituted them and gave them their official support when they were the imperial dynasty.\n\nBut the Silmunas control these isles no longer, and it is us who decide the fate of these tolls. Should we right this historical wrong that has affected our merchants and others so deeply? Or should we make this historical wrong a historical right - one that works for us? Just think of the money…"

 A16_forests_of_bloodwine_title:0 "Forests of Bloodwine"
 A16_forests_of_bloodwine_desc:0 "Our hired adventurers, exploring Aelantir, have come back to us with several interesting reports on the Bloodgroves. It is a striking place, covered with a great forest of white trees that leak a blood-like substance, our colonial adventurers have been fascinated with the sights of the place. What has caught our eye in particular, however, is the Ruinborn of the area and their local cultivation, as it includes grapes. As far as we can tell, these are similar to the ones we cultivate at home, thus meaning that the Bloodgroves is perfect territory for winemaking!\n\nOur colonists have been instructed to stake our claim over this territory before anyone else can, and begin preparing it for the cultivation of wine. We can adopt some of the local Ruinborn’s wines, what they call ‘Issushi’, and naturally our own growing variety of wines. And to help put our hooks into the growing Trollsbay states, we shall give them a great deal on our wine from the Bloodgroves, getting them hooked on the drinks and presenting us with another market by which we can sell them."

 A16_the_amadia_colonie_title:0 "The Amadia Colonie"
 A16_the_amadia_colonie_desc:0 "The rediscovery of Aelantir brings with it new markets and new opportunities. Our Cannorian peers are already carving out bits and pieces of the old world for themselves, feasting greedily on the legacy of the precursors like gnolls on a corpse.\n\nThe League is not an expansionist power by any stretch, but we do predict a need for territory in Aelantir, if nothing else to prevent our rivals from strangling our access to the markets of the entire continent - markets which, our merchants assure us, will continue to expand for the foreseeable future.\n\nEven so, we do not need vast holdings overseas, and we have no desire to tangle with the powers that do. As such, the distant region of Amadia, in the far west of South Aelantir, is ideal. It is remote, yet with ample coastlines for ports and ships. Crucially, our explorers report that a great lake can be found far inland, and that the soil surrounding it is both ample and fecund. This makes the region ideal for viticulture, and as such, it must be ours. Amadia has a native population, but our explorers claim that they are relatively peaceful, and are as such unlikely to offer us meaningful resistance."

 A16_trade_with_kheionai_title:0 "Trade with Kheionai"
 A16_trade_with_kheionai_desc:0 "With Amadia in our grasp, we can see with greater clarity the Aelantir after Ash. While the apocalypse left few survivors, some precursors still live, though the scale of the devastation has reduced them to something far lesser than what they once were.\n\nOf particular note are the blue-skinned Kheionai, descendants of a precursor settlement on the island of Alecand, who were seemingly distant enough to avoid destruction with the rest of the continent. The Kheionai are wealthy and their island offers a lucrative market, but they are difficult to reach. We have attempted to establish a trade route south, along the coast of the great blue desert, but none of our vessels have returned. The Kheionai insist that the so-called "Kaydhano" has destroyed our ships, and that such a trade route is unwise. Much as it stings our naval pride, we will need to book passage for our envoys on Kheionai ships, and send them to Alecand to establish trade routes we can use, and gather information on this ‘Kaydanho‘."

 A16_our_leyend_overseas_title:0 "Our Leyend Overseas"
 A16_our_leyend_overseas_desc:0 "Ever since the League of Winebay was founded, The Order of the Seventy Chalices have been a steady fixture in our administration. The Order was founded as a league of equals between the major vintners of Wineport - the so called Wine Barons - and many of our best and brightest stem from one of the families who make up the Order.\n\nWhile less benevolent rulers would no doubt see such a powerful organization as a threat, we have had little to fear from the Order. Our goals align closely, for as the state prospers, they do as well. As our domination of the wine trade grows ever more self-evident, the Order has approached us with an offer of closer cooperation. They have even suggested a military reform, consolidating their various levies and private armies into a more cohesive unit; a well-trained unit of guards and protectors, for the protection of what the Order of the Chalice has has taken to calling ‘Their Great Cellar‘."

 A16_build_up_bottlepoint_title:0 "Build Up Bottlepoint"
 A16_build_up_bottlepoint_desc:0 "While most cities in the League make most of their money from trade, there is somewhat of an exception to that rule: Bottlepoint. Of course, they are no strangers to the mercantile business, they are just perhaps not as popular of a port as Wineport is. Merchants often bypass them for the premier trading locale in the Bay of Wines. This often causes them to resent the rest of the league, and grumble about being left behind.\n\nThose grumbles have turned into complaints, and it has gotten to the point where we must act. Their own leader and our Wine Barons have seen several areas where we could invest - namely, their production facilities. With some well placed investments, we can open glassmaking foundries, support their barrel-making businesses, and make Bottlepoint our premier crafting hub! Because, let’s be honest, their wine cannot compare to ours."

 A16_dwarven_craftsmen_title:0 "Dwarven Craftsmen"
 A16_dwarven_craftsmen_desc:0 "We realise where the Bottlepointers might have learnt their skills in grumbling and complaining from - their Dwarven community - though that is perhaps being unfair to Bottlepoint’s Dwarven enclave, as they are a valued and important community for us. They often serve as the premier craftsmen of barrels and glasses for the storage of our wine, and for the latter their designs are known to be intricate and beautiful - almost as lovely as the contents within!\n\nWe should invest into the Dwarves and their businesses in Bottlepoint to show to their community that they are held high in our esteem, which should hopefully attract Dwarven customers. Rubies are red after all, just like (most) of our wine! And this investment should also have the added benefit of fully integrating Bottlepoint into the League of Winebay, as a premier crafting hub."

 A16_unite_the_league_title:0 "Unite the League"
 A16_unite_the_league_desc:0 "Our League has long been a loose affair, uniting disparate towns and cities in the Bay of Wines in the common goal of prosperity, wealth, and security. But with our many recent efforts to both expand our holdings and to reinforce those we already have, the League of Winebay has grown from this loose alignment into a true force in the Bay of Wines; one that can face our enemies and come out on top, and introduce the wonderful people of Cannor to the wide varieties and tastes of our wines.\n\nWith this more coherent form of governance, we have prepared to formally organise our League, giving true power to the Wine Barons and Wine Merchants. The former will see the Seventy Chalices given some legislative powers, and the latter can expect their guilds to be given a close ear of government. This should serve to further our ambitions… And to make an excuse for a wine-fuelled party!"

 A16_home_of_port_title:0 "Home of Port"
 A16_home_of_port_desc:0 "Though we have incorporated many new cities into our League, we must not forget the two cities that began it: Wineport and Foxalley. It was their union that founded the League, and the Council of Seventy Chalices meet in Wineport as well, with most calling either of the two cities their homes. The wine there is, of course, the best in the League - though don’t say that to a Bottlepointer, lest you wish to start a wine-fuelled fistfight.\n\nIt is high time we took some of the wealth we have gathered and spread it about, that some might flow back to the core of the League. The guildhalls shall be expanded, barrel and bottle crafters shall be given leave to expand their industry, and the wine will flow even more generously than before."

 A16_organize_the_watchers_title:0 "Organize the Watchers"
 A16_organize_the_watchers_desc:0 "Wineport is, primarily, a nation of traders, farmers and craftsmen. Though not unaccustomed to war, most would prefer to live their life undisturbed by it and to live (and drink) in peace. But, if we are to see our ambitious goals realised, fight we must. Fortunately for us, several mercenary concerns operate in these lands, looking to serve those who pay well and promise great reward… and one thing we have is a lot of money. And who has ever heard of a mercenary who’d say no to endless wine?\n\nThese mercenary bands are rather disparate at the moment, but at the initiative of the Wine Barons who often employ them, we are ready to provide the funds to consolidate them. We intend to make of them two forces, ready to serve at our beck and call - the ‘Wineport Watchers’ and the ‘Foxalley Foxes’. Amalgamated into these mercenary companies, we shall have a professional and loyal mercenary force upon which to call."

 A16_the_final_push_title:0 "The Final Push"
 A16_the_final_push_desc:0 "We must now prepare our levies and pay our mercenaries, as we prepare to march. Now we must unfortunately put aside the wine bottle and prepare for conflict, as we set our sights on the rest of the Winebay. With our conquest of these lands, it would make our dominion over the Bay of Wines uncontested and bring ever more profitable lands into the League.\n\nIt will require our toughest tests yet, facing down the greatest powers of the region - including the beast of Lorent. We can only console ourselves with one thing with the upcoming conflict: just imagine all the extra wine we’ll have once we take the rest of the Winebay…"

 A16_free_coast_title:0 "Free the Coast"
 A16_free_coast_desc:0 "We have taken the coast! Already our Wine Barons are snatching up the vineyards of the Upper Winebay, and old enemies are accepting their new place as Barons rather than Lords. Their wine no longer presents competition to us, but instead wealth for our coffers. We couldn’t be happier with our accomplishments.\n\nBut... wouldn’t it be nicer to have more? And we look north, and see only more wine that we should be glugging down, not those Wine Lord bastards… We’ve already proven our might, it would be a simple endeavour to take more. Let us call the troops and mercenaries to the banner again, and march forward, so that all wine shall belong to us."

 A16_gold_god_good_wine_title:0 "Gold, God, Good Wine"
 A16_gold_god_good_wine_desc:0 "With our new ambition proclaimed, it is best that we first seek divine backing for our grand goal of collecting the world’s wine. Of course, there is a fine candidate for this: the ever-lovely Minara, due to our friendship (with benefits) with the priests of Minar. We are not the only ones to swear our loyalty to the Lady of Passion, naturally. The Esmari are famous for their raucous celebrations on their River Barges, and the priests of Minar have said that the main fuel for these parties is Minar’s Succor, a wine made via a secret process by priests of Minara.\n\nWe must have a taste of this for ourselves, and several bottles to place in our national wine cellar. We have begun to send out feelers, and we expect an invite to the Esmari River party on our desks soon - not least because of the bottles of wine we sent complimentary with the request."

 A16_sorncost_initiative_title:0 "Sorncóst Initiative"
 A16_sorncost_initiative_desc:0 "Sorncóst produces many types of wine, red and white alike. However, its most popular is a rosé - the titular Sorncóst. It is a dry wine, one that goes pleasantly with local Sorncósti cuisine and is a welcome drink during the hot summers in the Bay of Wines.\n\nIt is also a drink that already has a burgeoning international market, enjoyed greatly by much of the nobility across the Divenhal. As such, the local Wine Barons have proposed we expand the production of the drink so it can reach regions further afield in the Divenhal, such as Bulwar. The people there are certain to enjoy such a fine drink. And so should we, in fact - for this wine will make for a fine addition to the National Cellar."

 A16_pearlywine_title:0 "One Wine, Two Wine"
 A16_pearlywine_desc:0 "We Lencori are most famous for our red and rosé wines, having dozens of varieties all prepared in the vineyards that crisscross our lands, though we dabble now and then in a dessert white. Even many connoisseurs overlook this, however, as just to our east lie the most famous of the white wines, Pearl Vintage and Pearl Modern, which even we must begrudgingly admit are excellent drinks. Pearl Vintage - sparking, light and dry - is a truly prestigious drink that pairs swimmingly with seafood. For the dessert course, one can set off the sweet with a Pearl Modern, enjoying a delicious vanilla aroma and a taste that has only been enhanced with the introduction of noble rot to the grapes that produce it.\n\nWe simply must add these to the national wine cellar: first, by taking the vineyards that produce them if we have not done so already, and then investing greatly in their production. This should hopefully please the producers of both, who are known for their fierce rivalries. And then of course a customary visit is due, to officially bring these two great wines into our national collection."

 A16_red_wine_blue_wine_desc:0 "Though it isn’t actually blue, the Saloren Blue is made from particularly dark blue grapes, giving it a distinct dark-purple vintage. This distinctive character also extends to its flavour, one that is very woody in comparison to other reds, making it for most an acquired taste. But one thing we love to do is acquire tastes, and many of our barons swear by the drink and its unique character.\n\nAs such, we once again must invest in the region of its production, the Eastern Winebay, to make sure that everyone can give this drink a try. Afterwards, as is customary, our $MONARCHTITLE$ shall make a visit and bring the wine into our ever growing National Cellar."

Those adventurers who travelled with Corin have now settled down, turned their swords into ploughshares, and made states of their own. Many of those ploughshares have been used to dig vineyards, where grapes once again grow. Most of those who have revived these Escanni vineyards are descended from Lencori adventurers, and some links still remain between them and their homeland.\n\nWe must try to get our hands into this growing market, for while they may make their own wine, it will never be enough to truly satisfy the thirst of any true noble. We shall seek out those friends of wine in Escann and cultivate a relationship with them - and then, with some smart investments in their vineyards, we shall be able to bring their wine trade under our influence."

Wealth pours into the Winebay coffers, the people are pleased - And perhaps a little tipsier than usual - And business is booming.\n\nYet it has never done for us to rest on our grapevines, and while great wealth often breeds complacency in rulers, there is no law saying that it needs to be so. Already we have the means to invest in natural scientists, in architects, in builders. We have the means to make our every whim a reality; to make vineyards that to our ancestors would seem mythical.\n\nSo let us do as good entrepreneurs should, and invest in our country. Every corner of our domain shall see our wealth at work, and every vintner in our League shall bless the day they chose (or were chosen) to join our great nation!"

Our merchants - or our wares at any rate - Can be found in the cellar of any major, noble or priest worthy of the name. In Rahen, hobgoblins enjoy a taste of Bridgewine on campaign, while the Harimari sip Busilari Stout from gilded cups. In old Aelantir to the west, rugged adventurers share tales with Ynnic elves over Citadel Purple, while the nobles of Eordand, unfathomably wealthy from the remnants of the precursors, sip on Liquid Sunlight, the wine having made the journey from Bulwar on our ships, of course.\n\nAs for Chylys, there is always someone willing to pay for Chylys. The price is always dear, but for a very, very few, Chylys is worth anything. We pity them, but we will take their money all the same.\n\nSo let us celebrate in proper Wineporter fashion - By throwing the biggest party Lencenor has seen in a thousand years or more!"

In the many little states that cover southern Lencenor, we often find ourselves butting heads, especially over the issues of river navigation and, of course, wine. We control their access to the sea, thus we can limit access to their, we must admit, lovely varieties of wines.\n\nPerhaps that should be changed, though? With Lorent in the ascendant after the end of the Lilac Wars, we need all the friends we can get, and Minar would be a good friend to have: after all, we share their enthusiasm for the God of Celebrations. Some offers of lucrative rates on trade, or our protection in exchange for some access to their temple tithes, shall help to bridge the gap."

But such integration does make us think that we could be bound even closer together, much as Toarnaire is. A closer union would help our position in the region and offer the Minaran Temple greater protection from nearby foes. It means more wine for us, and the Temple has many types we would be happy to include in our trading portfolio.\n\nMany of our Barons are devotees of Minara, and are great patrons of their temples. We shall take a leaf from their book and offer the Temple a grand sum to convince them to come firmly into our orbit."

These stem mostly from those who still believe that Rubenaire might come to save them from our ‘tyranny’. ‘What tyranny?’, you may ask. The type of tyranny that oppresses those poor nobility who now have to put a little work in to compete with our wine barons and merchants to actually make money. These fools have more fear for their coffers than any concern over rights or justice or whatever other terms they might appeal to.\n\nIt is up to us to stamp out these seditious elements, and firmly plant our flag on Coruan so that none may dare of taking it from us. And, after we make an example out of Coruan’s loyalists to Rubenaire, it should serve as an ample program to carry out for our plans to expand further into the duchy."

Of course, any true Wineporter would balk at so simply summarising such a broad category, but for most people this is the taste of the wine they drink, that of Rubenaire Red.\n\nEvery Lencori village and town have their own take on it while still preserving its distinctive tone, and many other wines recognise it as their grandfather vintage. While such iconic status has often challenged our own more original productions, we need not worry about that now, as the home of Rubenaire Red is now part of our League.\n\nEven if fine connoisseurs might turn up their nose at such a ‘common’ drink, we would be fools to dismiss such international brand recognition out of hand. In fact, we should celebrate, as more wine for the world is good for everyone - especially us! We should improve the facets of the production of wine in Rubenaire proper, so that Rubenaire Red may truly become a household name."

 A16_toward_sorncost_desc:0 "In the Winesbay, one does not have to sail very far out of port to see a Sorncósti vessel cruising past, commanded ably by one of their merchant-adventurers and laden with a fine bevy of goods. The people of Sorncóst are much like us, in that regard. They take like a fish to water, their merchants travelling across the Dameshead and Divenhal in search of goods to trade, and they love a good bottle of wine (or two) to relax after a long days working selling barrels of the stuff. They do all this based in some of the finest country in Lencenor: warm and dry, with vineyards coating its rolling hills.\n\nThis makes controlling such land and people very intriguing to us - imagining those ships flying the flag of Wineport, and those grand vineyards under our control, rather makes the mouth water… though maybe that is simply the Sorncóst vintage on our tongues. To get there, we must first slash through the Southern Flats and their somewhat less appealing cattle farms."

 A16_sorncosti_techniques_desc:0 "Though we were always the greatest wine merchants in all Halann, with our merchants and barons working hand in hand to bring the world our delicious libations produced in the League, we all bitterly knew in the back of their heads - our wines could not compare to those of Sorncóst. Their grapes always seemed to be riper, their drinks just a little bit sweeter, a bit dryer… whatever they wanted to make their wine do, they just did it that little bit better than us. It was a source of great envy and great shame. Most wine barons kept hidden Sorncósti collection in their cellars, only to be brought out amongst those who knew the truth, and they always secretly resented hearing from a client that the Sorncósti had visited recently, knowing that a sum had just been slashed off of their profit.\n\nBut what was one an uncomfortable truth is now a great joy, as Sorncóst’s vineyards are now under our control! Though they may be aggrieved at first, we shall win them over with our shared love of winemaking. And, with some investments into their crafts, we can assuredly have them share their techniques, so that all wine in the League may taste as good as Sorncóst’s."

 A16_wine_must_flow_desc:0 "Though it is lost to memory, our history books still record well the reaction of some of the Winelords of Lorent to the pronouncement of the League of Winebay. It was one of scorn, derision, and ridicule. They considered our alliance of lesser wine barons and merchants a joke, our statesmen opportunistic paupers and hucksters. Most offensively, they claimed our wine was little better than swill, the gravest insult one could level in Lencenor.\n\nWell, they are not saying that now.\n\nWith our conquest of Lorentainé, the old power of Lorent is swept away. They no longer control the fate of the region, strangling all wine and lands under their control. Instead, their former subjects bend the knee to us, and recognise our control over all the wines of Lencenor. That is what we have achieved - total dominion over the largest and grandest wine producing country in all of Cannor - nay, all of Halann. Unlike them and their poisonous words, however, we shall be gracious in victory - for like the Bloodwine river, the wine must continue to flow. This time, rather than as little streams, as a grand roaring rapid that shall spread across the whole globe."

We now utterly dominate trade in the Bay of Wines, and barring a Cataclysm we shall soon have all of Cannor supping from our grand supply. But why must we stop our ambitions there? We may control Cannorian trade, but what about the rest of the globe? While others battle for Halann, we can find our own goal - bringing all wines under our dominion, and making sure that a citizen of Wineport can drink any wine they desire.\n\nAlready, our wine barons plan travels across the globe, a great Wining Crusade, from the Mists of Yanshen to the Shadowlands in deepest Sarhal. We shall match our ambitions to theirs, and proclaim the beginning of something even grander than the League of Winebay - the Winebay Alliance. We fear the attack of no monstrous Hordes nor the Wrath of a Witch King, for all shall appreciate a fine glass of wine grown and produced in any of the lands of the Winebay Alliance!"

The names were once synonymous with power, wealth and prestige in Lencenor as the three great Wine Lords, providing their services and vintages to Lorent. They held themselves in high regard, considering themselves the true masters of the land and looking down their noses at the rest of us, not worthy of their time or attention. Their tune has changed however, as they now answer to Wineport rather than Lorentaine, and it is rather hard to keep their nose held high while they bow at our feet. With our hold over their lands, we now command their wines.\n\nEven if we may hold some grudges, it would be a waste to let them determine our attitude towards the vineyards of the Wine Lords. We shall include them happily amongst our trade, as it shall ensure that we remain the dominant wine exporter, with all the wines of Lencenor now found under our banner."

They now produce some of the most unique and desirable wines of the whole region, benefiting from the prestige of elven wines, the limited nature of their production, and the simple fact that they are very good wines. Best amongst these is Redglade Fíonca, a red that is known for being a pleasantly soft drink with fruity undertones - said to be due to the inclusion of a few strawberries in the brewing process.\n\nAs with all wines, we cannot simply leave such a good drink to gather dust in some old Elven wine cellars - it must be shared with the world, and specifically shared with us so we can share it with the world. We may do this by either appeals to the Elves of the Redglades, or by simply taking the place of production for ourselves. As long as we get our Fíonca!"

 A16_secrets_of_the_red_lineage_desc:0 "Also known as ‘The Blood of Lorenan’, Red Lineage is perhaps the most coveted wine in Halann. It is a dark, bold wine, one that all the nobility of Cannor desire, to pair perfectly with the richest meats acquired on great hunts. What makes it so valuable though is not just this high honour of a grand wine - it is how exclusive and secretive it is. Ask a noble where they got their bottle of Red Lineage - as most only have one bottle - and they will usually say it has been passed down for generations, or if they were lucky enough to acquire it, it was by chance with a mysterious trader.\n\nSuch a mystery begs to be solved, and as the premier wine traders on the globe it should surely be us who put an end to this age old mystery. With a little bit of funding, we can set up a taskforce from amongst our best mercenaries to try and locate the source of the Red Lineage."

 A16_secure_the_varilleni_desc:0 "When one pictures the archetypal sorcerer-king, one sees a brooding figure, sat upon their throne, a glint of magic in their eye - and a glass of glowing wine in their hand. While some may think it simply the imagination of an artist, wanting to emphasise the magical nature of the figure, true connoisseurs know it is a drink you can have yourself. Known as Varilleni Special, to differentiate it from its mundane variation of Varilleni Dry, it is a white wine that is imbued with magic by Ibevari winemakers. While Varilleni Dry pairs best with vegetable dishes, Varilleni Special is said to alter its taste to fit perfectly with any palate and to pair well with any meal, making it a very sought after drink. That, and - well, it looks pretty cool to have a glowing glass of wine.\n\nWe can’t miss acquiring such a prestigious drink for our collection. Ensuring our mages are at peace with what some might call a ‘frivolous’ use of magic will be necessary, as well as improving relations with the winemakers of Varillen. But, once this is done, we shall have magic in our hands, and after that, down our gullet."

Good fences make for good neighbours.”\n\n”But father, have you not forgotten something?”\n\n”I may have, my son.”\n\n”Why are all the vines in line, all across the field? Same height, same space, all across.”\n\n”I am glad you asked, my son. You see, the sky gives gifts to all: sun and rain in equal measure. But the grape is much like man. He falls too eagerly to Ildran and Forsara. And in his pride and his greed does he rise above his peers, and stretch his branches to drink greedily of the sun and the rain.”\n\n”Thus leaving his brothers in his shadow.”\n\n”Yes, my son.

Now that the Fourth Lilac War has ended, these veterans have returned to Wineport and are looking for new causes to put their sword towards.\n\nIn this matter, we can help them, as the disputed territory of Coruan is within our targets. Let us approach these mercenaries and invite them to serve our cause, and use their connections to attract any other such soldiers of fortune to our banner for this likely conflict. This should give us an influx of forces ready to wrest Coruan from Rubenaire’s control, and help cement our control of the Bay of Wines."

 A16_the_fifth_city_desc:0 "When we broke with Lorent in the aftermath of the collapse of the Duchy of Íselsuin, it was the great cities of the Eastern Winebay that came together to sign the treaty that established the League: Wineport, Foxalley, Bottlepoint, and Coruan. We were all to be joined together in a love for trade and wine, but the jealous Wine Lord of Rubenaire had other plans. During that chaotic time, they marched their troops into Coruan before we could muster an effective force, saying they were doing it to ‘restore order’. What ignoble rot! While we managed to put together a force to ensure our continued independence, our comrades in Coruan were lost. No longer.\n\nAfter our struggle against Rubenaire, we can finally truly welcome Coruan into the fold of the League of Winebay, as they should have been several decades ago. Beneficially for us, the fleet of Rubenaire was also stationed within the city. While many ships were scuttled in the capture, others sustained only light damage, and can quickly be pressed into service in our fleet."

What is not lesser, though, is their lands. Their primary port, Pírcóst, competes with Wineport to attract merchants and revellers in the bay, and though it does not boast extensive vineyards itself, the local industry of cloth is the envy of the whole bay. Most self-respecting wine barons and merchants have at least several articles of clothing made by Pírcósti artisans, and many ships source their sails from there.\n\nAnd that is to not even mention the beauty of the titular city of Eilísin, nestled in between vineyards that stretch as far as the eye can see - though that is not exactly uncommon along the Bloodwine. Nevertheless, it promises ever more land and wealth we can bring into our domain and profit off of, while eliminating the competition at the same time."

While we can expect imperial support in any conflict, this is cold comfort to the people of the Bloodwine, who would be first in line against the prickly flower of Lorentish chivalry.\n\nThis fact is not lost on the League, and it is incumbent on us to show our gratitude by investing in the fertile vineyards (and military infrastructure) of the region. The pride and joy of Eilísin viticulture is the Threerose Rosé, a fruity and lean wine, symbolic perhaps of the revival of the local vineyards following their devastation in the Lilac Wars. While we and they have historically been at odds in the wine trade, now is the time for reconciliation. Let us extend our hand in friendship to the vintner's guilds of Eilísin, and permit them the sale of their products through our ports, as Eilísin Triros!"

We have proven in Eilísin and Pircóst that, unlike the nobility of Lencenor, we care for the people upon whom our rule rests. Let us show poor neglected Madelaire that they are our people too, and since they are red-blooded Lorentish, we know exactly how. The pride of their duchy is a rich wine, simply named "Madelaire". It is a wine of quality, but despite its popularity with the nobility, it has never gained wider appeal. Now, through us, Madelaire has access to a greater market than ever before. Together, we will grow rich."

 A16_bridgewine_trade_title:0 "Bridgewine Trade"

At the time, we assumed that we would mainly be exporting. At the time it seemed obvious that no eastern swill could match our carefully cultivated viticulture.\n\nBut, times do change, and as we have integrated into Anbennar, we have encountered competition. One such competitor is the free city of Menibór, who boast a so-called "Bridgewine", named after the city's many bridges. And much like these bridges, bridgewine is a sturdy affair, hearty and spicy, warm even. Many mercenaries, including our own, swear by it, and claim that it is the second-best companion to have on a hard campaign.\n\nSetting aside our bruised pride, healthy competition benefits everyone.

Businor sits where the Divenhal narrows, with the isle of Tef plugging the straits like a cork in a bottle. It has been said that those who control Tef, control the Divenhal, and the masters of the city of Eborthíl certainly do their best to make this true.\n\nOur relationship with Eborthíl has always been difficult. They for their part charge a tariff for access through their strait, and while Bulwar is wealthy, the elven rulers of this distant land prefer their own wares to foreign imports.\n\nBut times are changing. Many younger merchants see Bulwar as an untapped market, begging for exploration. Let us send envoys to Eborthíl, and see if we can negotiate favourable terms of passage. We will even offer to export some of their local wine in return, even if this so-called "Businori Fortified" is an... acquired taste at best."

 A16_citadel_purple_title:0 "Citadel Purple"
 A16_citadel_purple_desc:0 "Bulwari viticulture is an interesting, if macabre, affair. There are two main sources of wine in Bulwar: the great citadel cities built to repel gnollish invasions and the vast estates along the Suran and Buranun. The citadel vineyards tend to be built along mountainsides in carefully-maintained, winding terraces. What little soil there is tends to be of high quality, no doubt due to the spectacular amounts of human, elven and gnollish blood spilled upon it.\n\nIt is with this in mind that our envoys have approached the legendary citadel Azka-Szel-Azka, whose vintners produce a wine so dark that it goes by the name "Citadel Purple". This wine, made from sun-dried grapes, is dry with an almost metallic aftertaste; it is popular with humans, but supposedly also with gnolls and sun elves, who both claim that it has a "lively" bouquet. The master of the citadel seems amenable to trade, but they also speak of a challenge for us..."

 A16_liquid_sunlight_title:0 "Liquid Sunlight"
 A16_liquid_sunlight_desc:0 "Ever since their arrival, elves have been the bane of the Lencori vintner. While any red-blooded Lencori would boast of at least some elven heritage, the truth is that pure-blooded elves simply live longer. And since the vintner’s art favours patience and care, elven vintners have what many would call an unfair advantage.\n\nAs fellow craftsmen, we have therefore always had a healthy respect for elven wine. Jaherian Sunlight is similar to Citadel Purple, in that it is made from sun-dried grapes. But, unlike Citadel Purple, Jaherian Sunlight is then barrelled up and rolled inside the elven vintner's estate, not to be seen again within a human lifespan. The process is unknown, perhaps unknowable, but the result is exclusive, rare and obscenely expensive, which is why it would make a perfect addition to our arsenal. Historically, the sun elves have been entirely disinterested in trading with us, but Bulwar has changed since Jaher's time. And we need only find one elven vintner who will let us shower them in gold. So let us begin our search!"

Those who study it insist that the laws of physics we follow are there mere suggestions, beholden to powers beyond our understanding. And this is where the legend of Chylys springs forth; not a great drama or a fairytale, but a question.\n\nWhat is Chylys? What is a wine, grown in a place where time, space and all the laws that make a wine are changeable? Many have claimed to own a bottle of Chylys, and many have claimed to have tasted it. But none can agree on what the taste is like, and the wood elves make little of it, making it almost as rare as compassion in a Vertesker.\n\nRarity however, is not in itself a problem, and we are blessed with a vast network of contacts, some of which reach into even the Deepwoods. Let us see if we can find a seller of Chylys, elven or otherwise. It will be expensive for us, priceless for our customers, and it will make both us and our benefactor very, very rich."

 flavour_wineport.1.d:0 "A Wine Baron, Evin, poured $MONARCH$ a glass, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gladly supped upon it, deeply satisfied with both the taste and what it represented. It was a glass of Bridgewine from Menibór, a fine vintage, and one that was previously rather hard to get a hold of. Evin poured himself a glass as well, and clinked it against the $MONARCHTITLE$’s.\n\n’Here’s to toll-free trade and increased business for all! Wait until I inform our Imperial friends of the good news…’ he proclaimed, and downed his whole glass in one.\n\nAs he did so, another Wine Baron approached, Gisele, with a mischievous look on her face. She surreptitiously handed the $MONARCHTITLE$ a paper, and on it with some astoundingly large numbers.\n\n’This is the last report from the Pearlsedgers of the toll income before we… Cleared out their offices,’ she said. ‘Think, my $MONARCHTITLE$ - this money enriching us, and helping our merchants dominate Imperial trade - all you have to do is keep the tolls in place.’\n\nSeeing his fellow Gisele’s scheming, Evin angrily looks at her, and then to $MONARCH$.\n\n’We cannot! It would ruin our reputation with other Imperial traders, and have us marked as bad faith negotiators! You surely cannot be considering it, my $MONARCHTITLE$.’\n\nBoth of them look at $MONARCH$, and wait for their answer…"

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] looked between the two sides - one arguing for free trade and kept promises, how more trade will enrich everyone. The other side said to think of the League’s coffers and how they could be enriched, and how the Wine Barons could dominate trade. And then, of course, they all turned to the $MONARCHTITLE$, and waited for the final answer."

 flavour_wineport.3.d:0 "A messenger arrives at the grand temple to seek an audience with $MONARCH$. As he makes his way through the temple, briefly distracted by the many sights one can see in the Temple of Minara’s Bosom, it soon becomes clear that they come from Wineport, and on official business. Such business is pertinent, considering our recent turn in relations - where they were once amicable, if boisterous, we are now tied much closer together in many affairs. It appears they wish to take this relationship to the next level, as the messenger continues on to where $MONARCH$ is sat with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors. The messenger unfurls a scroll, clears his throat, and begins to speak.\n\n’To the great $MONARCHTITLE$ of Minar, who oversees the greatest celebrations in all Cannor and brings the people of Wineport much joy. We have come with an offer to take over your secular affairs, so that you may better focus your activities on those important temporal affairs of merrymaking and lovemaking. Accompanying this messenger is a convoy, presenting a great many gifts of wealth and fine art, which I am sure you will appreciate, which shall be donated if you are to accept this reasonable request.’\n\nThe messenger finished, he motions to the temple doors, where a number of servants bring in sacks of gold coins, and some fine pieces of art - one a very flattering image of the $MONARCHTITLE$. As the advisors whisper sweet somethings amongst themselves, the messenger awaits the response of $MONARCH$."

As he approached $MONARCH$, the Wine Barons assembled chuckled amongst themselves as they saw that the messenger still had faint stains of lipstick on his face, and was putting up a conspicuous effort to hide his neck under his clothes.\n\n’Is that a good sign, or-’\n\n’’Simply a part of Minari hospitality, as I am reliably informed,’ replied a baron to the other asking the question. $MONARCH$ stilled the room as they motioned for the messenger to deliver the news.\n\n’Ah, yes, of course, my $MONARCHTITLE$. I can at least say that the Minari were happy to see a messenger from your court,’ He says with a nervous chuckle. ‘But, as for their response to our gracious offer of wealth and jurisdiction over their secular affairs…’"

 flavour_wineport.5.t:0 "Secrets of the Red Lineage - Getting Information"
 flavour_wineport.5.d:0 "The Foxalley Foxes are, along with their many other qualities, some of the finest trackers in Cannor. And it is precisely for this reason that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has chosen to employ them for this most sensitive of missions. For while Lencenor has many rulers, it has only two crowns. One is the ruby crown of Lorent, and while our nation has ambitions, those do not aspire to petty monarchy. The second crown is the Blood of Lorenan, a fabled wine, produced in secret somewhere in Lencenor. And this monarch of wines is one we must own.\n\nFortunately for us, the Foxalley Foxes are consummate professionals. Already their leader has briefed [Root.Monarch.GetName] on regions of interest and likely suspects. [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs only provide the funding, for bribes and payments. Informants on a matter this sensitive are bound to be expensive. Finally, of course, comes the matter of methodology. The Foxalley Foxes, despite their reputation on the battlefield, prefer a softer approach when investigating. Much can be learned from simply asking politely, after all. Even so, they know full well that wine is a serious affair, for Wineport in general, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] in particular. A decision must be made as to how far to go in search for the Red Lineage. In their captain's words.\n\n”Do we seek, or do we ransack?”"
 flavour_wineport.5.a:0 "Squeeze truth from your suspects, like juice from a grape."

 flavour_wineport.6.d:0 "The captain of the Foxalley Foxes saunters into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s study, looking much like their vulpine namesake. They offer a sweeping bow, before reporting.\n\n”Your quarry is in Lorentainé my lord. A modest brewery, sequestered in the dungeons beneath the city academy. To my knowledge, they suspect nothing, and my finest men are ready to take the compound. All we need is your word.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] nods and hums thoughtfully, their brow furrowed.\n\n”And what, my captain, is the measure of these vintners? Do you believe that they would be willing to strike a deal?”\n\nIt was the captain's turn to ponder. They gazed off into the distance, before shrugging.\n\n”They are not warriors, but the Rose of Lorent is a prickly plant. I would capture them first, and negotiate here, on your terms.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] nods in agreement.\n\n”Make it so, my captain.”\n\nAs the captain departs for Lorentainé, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes out the window. Trust was a curious thing: most vital in negotiations, but so difficult to nurture. When the Lorentish vintners arrive, how should they be received? Gold was a poor substitute for honour, especially in Lorent. Torture was an option, but it seemed a boorish way to obtain the Blood of Lorenan.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sighed, and called for a glass of wine. Some Madelairé always helped clear their thoughts.\n\nWhat to do...?"

 flavour_wineport.7.d:0 "Castíne stepped off the gangplank, and onto the pier. Bulwar! Beautiful sun-kissed Bulwar. She grinned broadly at the elven envoy who was waiting for her, offering her most charming smile. Castiné loved the elves: their ageless beauty, their refinement, their culture... And their wine. Especially their wine. This was why she was here, after all.\n\nThe elf bowed deeply. ”Honourable envoy, we are elated to welcome you to the domain of [wineport_bulwar_contact.Owner.GetName]. May you walk in Surael's Light, during your stay and forevermore.”\n\nCastiné returned the bow. It was no easy feat, but she had practiced. As with all things elven, there were many small details to even a bow, where one could err. Frustrating, to be sure, but she enjoyed a challenge.\n\n”And may Surael's Light give you sight to see, the purpose of my visit. I have missed Bulwar dreadfully, dear envoy.”\n\nThe elf smiled. Then nodded. ”My master is most curious, it must be said. We are blessed with your traders in our cities, yet your visit promises to be something... Special.”"
 flavour_wineport.7.a:0 "Special indeed! I cannot wait to tell them in person."
 flavour_wineport.7.b:0 "Special indeed! And we bear gifts worthy of the occasion."

 flavour_wineport.8.t:0 "Liquid Sunlight - The Meeting"
 flavour_wineport.8.d:0 "Castíne stepped into the workyard. It had been a long journey, for Liquid Sunlight was not steeped in some stinking still in the bustling cities of Bulwar. Rather, it was brought into being in the vast, sumptuous estates of the Sun Elves, far out in the countryside. Fortunately, the [wineport_bulwar_contact.Monarch.GetTitle] had been the image of a gracious host. Negotiations were going well, and as part of the process, nothing was more fitting than a visit to where the magic happened.\n\nIn many ways, Castíne observed, it felt very much like home. She immediately recognized the different stations and stages, where different parts of the vinification process took place. She noticed an elf in priestly garments, chanting over a barrel in which a human was crushing the grapes. Crushing was perhaps the wrong word - The man was dancing in tune with the chant, each step aligning with a syllable in what sounded like a song to Surael. It was hypnotic.\n\n"I could watch them all day.” A small voice piped up next to Castiné. She looked down, and saw a child-... No, an elf. A very short elf! Aside from the crow's feet in the corner of her eyes, her age was impossible to tell.\n\n”Everyone is excited about this, you know. Most people want to know all about your homeland. And your wine, of course.”\n\nCastiné nodded. She laughed gently. ”It is certainly less... intense than this. I almost feel like I am standing in a temple.”\n\n”In a way, you are. There is something spiritual about the growing. It brings us closer to Surael, I think.”\n\n”You know we are a heathen land. I hope this does not trouble you?”\n\n”A little, but I think the best way to change your mind is to show you a better path. Will you share your stories with us at dinner?”"
 flavour_wineport.8.a:0 "Absolutely! And if any of you want to visit Wineport, well..."
 flavour_wineport.8.b:0 "Absolutely! And I brought gifts for the workers. They do the work of Surael."

 flavour_wineport.9.d:0 "Castiné blanched behind her desk. The priest gazed at her sternly. It felt like little needles, boring into her forehead. She began to rub her eyes.\n\n”Can you... go over this again? Just so I am certain what I am hearing.”\n\n”Certainly. One of your... guards-” the priest spoke the word as if they had just scraped the word off their boot. ”-made several remarks to one of my-... The temple acolytes. I believe that they suggested a pairing. I will not sully my tongue with the specifics.”\n\nCastiné nodded. This was bad.\n\n”This is rank blasphemy, madam.”\n\n”Of course...”\n\n”However,” the priest sighed. ”The acolyte in question has made it known that they are willing to forgive the barb-...Rustic behaviour of your retainers, if...”\n\nCastiné felt a headache sneaking up her neck. She began to grind her teeth, this was going to be expensive...\n\n”...If your guard and yourself makes a formal apology to the temple in general, and the acolyte in particular, tomorrow at noon, before the main altar.”\n\nWait, really? That was all? Castiné blinked.\n\n”Am I to assume that you will acquiesce to this... Compromise?” The priest's voice was like ice."
 flavour_wineport.9.a:0 "Absolutely! Of course! Can I get that in writing?"
 flavour_wineport.9.b:0 "No actually. I don't see the problem here."

 flavour_wineport.10.t:0 "Liquid Sunlight - The Final detail"
 flavour_wineport.10.d:0 "Castiné looked out across the waves, as she swayed gently with the deck of the ”Seagull-on-the-Ear”. She was a sizable merchant ship, low in the water from a hold full of Bulwari luxury goods. Rugs, incense, finespun clothes, and several bottles of Liquid Sunlight. If anyone knew the value of the latter, she'd attract every pirate in the Divenhal. Luckily, Castiné had prepared accordingly, and she would be sailing with a squadron of the Wineport navy, as they patrolled the trade lanes. It was lucky that they had happened to be at port as she was leaving, but it also gave her an excellent pretext for departing in a hurry. The children of Jaher were proud, zealous, and worst of all, clever. Sooner or later, someone in her company would give offense, and it would be so very expensive. Better to leave then, while everyone was still pleased about the sale of Liquid Sunlight. Quite a few people in Bulwar stood to become extremely wealthy, after all. And those people had rivals, who would love nothing more than to make Castiné, the foreign heathen, a piece on their gameboard.\n\nNo, Castiné thought. It would be good to be home. She loved the elves, the Sun Elves especially. But it was an admiration best carried out from a safe distance. For now, the deal had been struck, arrangements made, and Wineport could add Liquid Sunlight to its long, long list of conquests. As for Castiné, she planned to keep at least one bottle for herself. Her salary was by no means pitiful, but a single bottle of Liguid Sunlight was worth more than she made in a decade.\n\nCastiné smiled. It was a good day."

 flavour_wineport.11.t:0 "A Petition Prepared"
 flavour_wineport.11.d:0 "When $MONARCH$ had suggested the idea of Imperial membership, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had perhaps expected the process of organising and presenting the formal request to take a bit longer. A group of Wine Barons, already trading in the Empire of Anbennar via Toarnaire, have come with one prepared and ready to go to the Emperor once the $MONARCHTITLE$ requests it - if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does.\n\nThe request comes with a pre-written letter, and a fine panoply of gifts to represent the benefits to the Emperor should we join. This is, unsurprisingly, mostly wine - the crown jewel amongst these a bottle of an excellent Roilsardi Red vintage. The merchant delegation presenting the petition are all familiar with the Imperial Court as well, ensuring that such a presentation of the request will go over smoothly. It is now simply up to our $MONARCHTITLE$ if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wishes to go ahead with the petition, or whether the League of Winebay should retain its total independence."

 flavour_wineport.12.d:0 "The servant approached, goblet of wine in hand, and $MONARCH$ leaned over to smell it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was greeted with a most pleasant odour - a nice tinge of acidity, and… Was that a hint of spice? A taste confirmed it, one that the $MONARCHTITLE$ savoured.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turned to the delegation before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] - a group of merchants, or Wine Barons as they referred to themselves. They were from the growing state of the League of Winebay, and their capital of Wineport.\n\n’That vintage, one of our finest, is just a taste of what the League can offer you, $MONARCHTITLE$. If you desire more like that, you should welcome us into the Empire - it would lessen restrictions on our goods, meaning if you wanted more than this taste, any further purchases would not hurt your coffers too dearly. Not to mention the economic benefits you can expect - our merchants are the most influential in the Bay of Wines, and seek to always expand our markets. We eagerly await your answer to our request.’"

 flavour_wineport.13.t:0 "And its Made from the Trees?"
 flavour_wineport.13.d:0 "I finally disembarked in our port in Dao Nako after considerable delay, due to the port’s rather ramshackle condition, and as it turned out my own men managing to get their way into one of the barrels of wine - for sea legs would not be enough to make them as wobbly as they were by the time we were ashore. Nevertheless, I was still in time for the meeting with the governor, who promised to show me ‘something wondrous’ at the feast this evening. I have been promised such things before and come back sorely disappointed, but it would prove to be rather different this time.\n\n…After making my way down, the food was laid out ready, and the governor and local Jiromji and Kaino notables were sat waiting. As I sat down, my eyes were drawn to the centre of the table, where a bottle of pale white liquid stood. Of course, I immediately asked about this, and received a reply from Junaidu, a Kaino chieftain.\n\n’That, my friend, is Kaino Drink, as you Cannorians have taken to calling it. We make it from the palm trees you have seen all around.’\n\n’You make it from trees? How… Interesting,’ I replied, barely hiding my interest. Everyone watched on, and I assumed they were waiting for me to have a taste. With such expectations, and the promise of a new wine to introduce back home in Wineport, I simply had to. And it tasted… Well, strange at first. Unlike any wine I had before. But as I drank more - and I did drink more - I grew to rather enjoy it. It had a sweetness to it that was pleasant, and the coolness of the drink was a great relief in the sweltering heat of the Sarhaly coast.\n\nI must admit, after I had had several glasses of the drink, and possibly some more, the rest of the evening and night became rather hazy. I do remember enjoying the local cuisine, then asking to be shown where they collect the palm wine. And then having a few more drinks there. When I woke up the next day, I noticed I was out of pocket of some of my money, but the ship’s hold had several barrels worth of palm wine. I was most satisfied, however, and a little relieved - it appears I still make sound financial decisions, when, well, not operating at absolute efficiency.\n\n-From the Journal of Malia síl Chalaal, Wine Baron and member of the WFTC"

 flavour_wineport.14.t:0 "Disappointment"
 flavour_wineport.14.d:0 "I hoped to be writing today about a new type of wine to be added to our collection, but it seems the gods were not kind enough to smile on me. I had come to Fahvanosy for two reasons: the first: to see how the colonies of the WFTC were developing, and the second: to locate and try what had been reported to me as ‘banana wine’. When I arrived at the islands, it was not too hard to locate the beverage - in fact, a group of halflings living in the nearby village were quite eager to share with me. It appeared they had just brewed some.\n\nAfter my prior experience with the drinks of Sarhal, I was more than eager to try this drink. But in this case, I would come away disappointed, as it turns out whoever had decided to call it ‘wine’ - some Vernman who could not detect the difference between a white and a red, clearly - was truly mistaken. The drink was a beer, not a wine. Not a bad beer, mind you, one that was very strong and rather sweet, but not wine.\n\nAs I communicated the misunderstanding to the Halflings, they seemed slightly apologetic, even though the mistake was not theirs. Here, I saw an opportunity: I offered to show them what Cannorian wine tasted like. They were eager to try, and so I had my crew roll up a few barrels and sell it to them at a somewhat discounted price. After that, they made a small party out of it, with a lot of drinking. They took rather well to it, and my men to the banana beer. And of course, I had a little bit, and lost track of events. Again.\n\nBut, as always, my business sense survived the drinking and the merrymaking, and I came to an agreement with the villagers to try and grow some grapes in their lands to let them have the best of both worlds, their beer and our wine. I communicated this to the Company, who seemed rather eager about the idea. I just hope they don’t take it too far - there are rather a lot of goods here that may, in fact, be just as valuable to us as wine.\n\n-From the Journal of Malia síl Chalaal"

 flavour_wineport.15.d:0 "The lizardfolk market, according to my colleagues who had already visited, was a difficult one to break into. Our merchants were working from a position of weakness, and it appears that the lizardfolk had thus seen us as not worth talking to. Now we had more of a foothold in their lands, they were more open to engaging with us. And me, in this particular case, as I hoped to succeed where others had failed and finally work out a proper agreement.\n\nIt was under these circumstances I met with several notable Lizardfolk figures in Khugra, and offered them wine to drink. They did seem disconcerted at the idea, but eventually relented after some persuasion. As they drank, I waited patiently - buoyed by the fact they seemed more relaxed once they were actually drinking the wine. After they finished, they all turned to look amongst one another, seemingly thinking of what to say.\n\n’It’s… It’s fine,’ One of them ventured.\nThis caused the rest to nod in agreement, others repeating ‘fine, yes, fine’. All seemingly afraid to admit they liked it too much, but still willing to accept it as a drink.\n\n’But, there are certainly ways it could be improved. Made more palatable to the more… refined Lizardfolk tastes.’ The others nodded again in agreement. I of course asked if they would be able to share some suggestions, and they were more than eager to supply them. Once I had taken out my journal to make notes I was barraged with a great amount of recommendations and requests, all of them highly specific - ‘the grapes should be trodden on this exact amount’, ‘the wine should be fermented in a barrel made of this tree’, ‘the wine should be spiced with this herb’, and dozens of others. One even told me a tale about how the 173rd of their Empires fell partially due to wine, so I must avoid making it like the wine in that story.\n\nI diligently recorded all these requests, and have passed it onto the Company. Even if they may be demanding, I do believe fulfilling the Lizardfolk’s requests would go a long way to making allies out of them, and expanding our influence in their markets.\n\n-From the Journal of Malia síl Chalaal"

The region had a rugged beauty, especially by the vast lake Chakantu, though it was less the beauty and more the fecundity of the soil that had made the League invest so heavily in this colony. The west bank was especially verdant, occupying a fertile plain between the jungles to the north and the increasingly arid uplands to the south.\n\nAll of this was not lost on Castíne, who took a moment to count her blessings for an unusually pleasant assignment. She and her entourage were simply to take inventory of the new colony, and report back to Wineport. A holiday by another name.\n\nOf course, Lake Chakantu had already been inhabited when the League settlers arrived, and as it turns out, the locals had brewers of their own. While their distillate was by no means wine, it had a certain rough charm. Remarkably, Lencori and Quchamár - this region's ruinborn - Had gotten along to such an extent that they were now mixing this brew with Lencori wines.\n\nCastíne chewed her lip. Wineport was not a zealous city, but mixing wine in such a manner was as close to heresy as you'd get. She would have to pen her report carefully, to avoid too much political friction. The worst part was that this strange bastard of a drink was undeniably quite delicious. Strange, to be certain, but delicious.\n\nShe sighed; she looked up at the sun, beaming down from a perfect blue sky. Tomorrow, she would interview the vintners, note down their methods. Try to promote the artistry of the process in her report. It would be a bit of work, but Castíne didn't mind the challenge. Especially not when it came with such good weather."

The document was placed in front of them, and each affixed their city’s seal to the Accord - ratifying this grand treaty. A great cheer rang out through the hall as it was ratified, and conversation slowly returned to the guildhall. Tomais grinned, seeing such a momentous event happen - and poured himself a fresh glass of wine.\n\n”Maybe politics isn’t so bad after all,” Tomais commented.\n\n”And why is that?”, Inquired a Wine Baron sat with him.\n\n”Because I just witnessed a treaty that will get me rich, all the while drinking wine I don’t have to pay for,” he mused, and took a drink from his glass.”"

The hall was divided and each side was trying to convince the monarch to their argument of a most raucous debate over which of their wines was better - Pearl Vintage, or Pearl Modern? $MONARCH$’s two glasses had been refilled several times now, so they were happy to let the debate carry on - but it did lead to a thought in their head that might cause even more problems in this rather acrid debate.\n\nOnce it looked like the barons were about to come to blows, after a Pearl Vintage baron called a Pearl Modern vintner ‘as rotten as your grapes’, $MONARCH$ finally intervened. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stilled the room with a shout - both from the volume, and from the radical, earthshaking words that came from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth:\n\n’Why not both?’\n\nSome of the barons, stunned, simply nodded along with $MONARCH$’s words, while others stared daggers at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Murmurs of ‘over my dead body’ were heard, and the $MONARCHTITLE$’s servants ushered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] out, knowing where this might lead… But not without grabbing several bottles of Pearl Modern and Vintage each."

 flavour_wineport.21.d:0 "It certainly had a unique taste, but not one $MONARCH$ was necessarily opposed to - the aroma of the Saloren Blue was smoky, like that of burning logs, and brought back pleasant memories of being sat in front of a fireplace. The taste was strong, but not entirely displeasing. The Saloren wine baron who had provided the drink looked at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], pleased that the drink had gone down well.\n\n’Do you know the story behind the Saloren Blue, my $MONARCHTITLE$?’, He enquired. $MONARCH$ shook [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head, and the wine baron began.\n\n’It was said, long ago in the days of the High Kingdom, that a mysterious knight visited the home of a retired knight. He had began a winery with his family, but it had fallen on hard times - the vines had wilted, and the harvest could not be made. The knight, hearing this, and seeing the misery this was bringing upon a champion of chivalry, rode through the fields on horseback. It seemed with every clatter of the hooves, something shifted, and when the retired knight’s family went out to check, the vines were green and healthy and adorned with the dark blue grapes that make Saloren Blue. The mysterious knight left without a word, having given this miracle to a chivalrous soul.‘"

Many of the finest jewellery and clothes she had were from the Redglades, and she counted Elves amongst her best customers. But as she sat in the grand hall of the Gladegates, she remembered the most tedious flaw of elves; they loved to take their time with everything.\n\nThey had given a grand display so far, of course - a beautiful elf was strumming on a harp, providing some comfort, she had been given a seat near the window, giving a lovely view of the Redglades stretching out before her, and her host was giving some pleasant small talk - something about the history of the building. But at this point, she did want a drink.\n\nCastíne decided to interject, her impatience catching up with her. ‘Now, you have been a most gracious host, and I thank you for providing your wonderful estate for me to see, but-’ She paused; her host was suddenly chuckling. Had she made some faux-pas? She looked around briefly, and then sighed and laughed to herself. Just as she had lost her patience, the bottle of Redglade Fíonca had arrived.\n\nThe Elven host chuckled as he took his first sip of the drink. ‘It appears your $MONARCHTITLE$ chose well when appointing you as a representative - you know just when things should arrive.’"

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was excited, for [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was to receive an elven mage from Ibevar - One supposedly old enough to have seen the Aldresian Crusade firsthand. Of course the delegate hadn't arrived yet, but if [Root.Monarch.GetName] had learned one thing of Elves, it was that they enjoyed theatrics.\n\nAs such, [Root.Monarch.GetName] half-expected that this mage would simply pop out of thin air in front of them, the moment their visit was scheduled. This was not exactly what happened - there was no pop. Instead, the wind picked up for a moment, and the air folded double in front of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s table, perspective shifting and curling impossibly into a sphere, before coming unwound with a sound like tearing cloth.\n\nAnd then, everything was normal again, aside from the elf now standing on the verandah. [Root.Monarch.GetName] made sure to look suitably impressed.\n\n”My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I am pleased indeed that you accepted my invitation. As a fellow vintner I have been beside myself with excitement!”\n\nThe elf, an older sun-tanned woman, bowed gracefully.\n\n”It was a tempting offer. Your humble city has built a reputation. With so few years left, I must be practical. And all wine flows here.”\n\n”Indeed, indeed! Shall we get to it then?”\n\n”Yes! The Varilleni. I confess, I have never seen its effects on a human. You simply must tell me your every experience as they occur to you. I shall be here, pen in hand, to document!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] had a moment of trepidation as the wine was poured. There was a glint in the old elf's eye. But surely it was just wine. Possibly the best wine in the world, if the legends were true.\n\n”Well... Moment of truth then!”\n\n”Yes. I believe it is.”"

This contributes to the obsession that the republic has with wine, seeing it as their raison d’etre to develop viticulture as their primary trade good.

And wherever their wine travels, the influence of what is now nicknamed the ‘Queendom of Wine’ is not far behind."
