 ###REFORM DESC###
 anbennar_call_for_reforms_desc:0 "Ever since the Wars of Rule, the Empire of Anbennar has stood strong against the chaotic forces that surround our borders. But in recent decades the imperial administration has become bloated, rising noble and mage tensions bring violent conflict, and an internal rot has set in eating at Imperial Authority.\n\nMake no doubt about it, we are in a slow decline. However if we embrace sizable and speedy reforms, we may be able to stop and even reverse our decay.\n--------------"
 anbennar_imperial_adventurer_companies_desc:0 "Adventurers have been many a boon and bane to desperate rulers throughout history. They fashion themselves as heroes but are little more than mercenary warbands. However one cannot deny the usefulness of these foolhardy disposable warriors, many imperial princes hire these adventuring companies for their wars.\n\nIt is beneficial to seek the formalisation of the hiring of these warriors and ease some requirements. By officially recognizing a few as imperial approved adventuring companies, we can negotiate their exorbitant costs and empower the imperial princes.\n--------------"
 anbennar_guarantee_temple_rights_desc:0 "As the Corinite Reformation rages on, the Imperial Temples grow uneasy about their place in the Empire. We must reassure them of their sovereignty, but what’s more is we can use the influence and power of the temples to temper the flames of religious conflict.\n\nThe Emperor will declare a proclamation to guarantee temple rights and more autonomy in their day to day functions. But the imperial administration intends to press for an open-mindedness even amongst our most zealous clerics. Hopefully they return a like minded response to our grace.\n--------------"
 anbennar_reinforce_imperial_frontiers_desc:0 "The Gawedi Eagle looms north and the Lorentish Rose seeks to strangle us from the west among other threats. The Empire’s defenses are crumbling and enemy armies threaten us from all sides. But by focusing resources of the Empire towards reinforcing its frontiers and providing a steady supply of fresh troops and materials to our marches, we will be able to put forward a formidable defense.\n--------------"
 anbennar_permanent_parliament_desc:0 "Calling the Imperial parliament is a severe logistical challenge that impedes our response to crises affecting the Empire. If we were to proclaim a permanent residence for the Parliament, staffed with representatives for each imperial prince and communicating to their overlords by sending stone, we could have an Empire responsive to terrible challenges by the minute.\n--------------"

All because of these violent political games around the Imperial Elections.\n\nIf we were to instead declare the Emperor title as hereditary, such political intrigue that plagues the Empire would be hampered. However it would also demand immediate subservience of the imperial princes to bend their knee to the Emperor. History would be made if this decision was passed through the Imperial Parliament.\n--------------"
 anbennar_nobles_of_the_wand_desc:0 "Due to the ever rising influence of Empire's elite classes, there has been a tenuous equilibrium between the imperial princes and the mages. More times than not, it has devolved into competition and violent political intrigue with the mages recently taking the upperhand. If the Emperor were to empower the mages within the noble class, perhaps this balance could be thrown out entirely with the dominant sorcerous faction taking control.\n--------------"
 anbennar_enable_magisterium_governance_desc:0 "The Magisterium is one of the key underpinnings of the Empire. Created after the Wars of Rule to consolidate mage influence and work together with the Empire to rule Anbennar, it has been a key player in regulating and controlling imperial magical affairs. Their reign has likely stopped many dark wizards from ever ascending into power.\n\nIf funding were to increase, privileges shifted from the competing noble mage organization, the Orda Aldresia, to the Magisterium, and ability for said mages to take executive action between imperial disputes; the Empire could start a new epoch of magical power.\n--------------"
 anbennar_erelas_doctrine_desc:0 "Challenging times loom over the Empire, and in response, the Emperor now weighs a bold, centralizing decree. The proposal: to cast a Geas - an ancient and binding spell - upon imperial servants and those with the potential to be the Emperor's gaze in all corners of the Empire., from the palace chambers to the distant frontiers of Arbaran. This spell would compel unwavering duty to the Emperor’s will, forging discipline through arcane means.\n\nCritics warn that such an act skirts coercion, risking the trust of Imperial Princes and unsettling the delicate balance of loyalty within the realm. Supporters argue it would unify command and strip power from those who threaten the Empire from within or without. With the debate drawing to a close, all eyes turn to the throne - the final decision rests with the Emperor.\n--------------§!"
 anbennar_regulate_artificery_desc:0 "The creation of Artificery was at first an exciting prospect, but many mages call such inventions unnatural. Many even express intentions to outright ban such a practice for heresy. In a way, the Djinn is out of the bottle and the Empire is unlikely to completely remove Artificery, however limits can be placed.\n\nThe parliament has sent a law to the Emperor, regulating Artificery and allowing several mage organizations authority to limit these practices anywhere in the Empire. Dissenters have argued that this is a naked grab for power by the mages, fearful of their losing their grip on magic to innovation. It is up to the Emperor to pass the law or reject it.\n--------------"
 anbennar_imperial_wizards_desc:0 "The Imperial War Mage Academy in Anbenncost has been a center of learning for the Empire but in recent decades has opted for a more academic approach to learning. The original intent was to train war mages for the Empire to fight and kill for Anbennar. That intent has been led astray, and the Emperor intends to revitalize the academy.\n\nBy establishing the Order of The Imperial War Wizards, reorganizing the Academy, and funneling graduates to the Order, the Empire can have a steady supply of powerful and zealous battlemages at the ready.\n--------------§!"
 anbennar_mages_peace_desc:0 "Never since the Wars of Rule have the mages of the Empire been so powerful. Indomitable and unassailable, these mages are loyal to the Emperor and question the endless politicking, backstabbing, and bickering by the Imperial Nobility.\n\nThe Grand Magister suggests flexing the new power of the mages to the princes. No more imperial politics, no more dubious wars, only the law of magic.\n--------------"

However since then, the mages have sought to expand their power throughout the centuries. The nobles in response attempt to counter the mage’s power and of recent one piece of legislation proposes to expand The College of Electors.\n\nIn a direct challenge to the Magisterium’s authority, the nobles propose to elevate Orda Aldresia as the eight elector. An order of noble mage knights, they are the rivals of the Magisterium and threaten to tip the status quo in favor of the nobility. Even if the mage knights are not chosen, an eight elector alone would dilute the mage’s political influence.\n--------------"
 anbennar_imperial_embassies_title:0 "Establish Imperial Embassies"
 anbennar_imperial_embassies_desc:0 "The Empire of Anbennar on paper is a unified entity that acts in lock step with each other. In practice, they are dozens of squabbling princes that all petition the Emperor over the most minute internal conflicts whether it be political or trade. This detracts the Emperor from focusing on more pressing external threats and situations.\n\nOne elector suggests the Emperor allows for the establishment of Imperial Embassies among the princes. This would delegate power to diplomatically handle their disputes amongst each other and free the Imperial Court to deal with outside powers more efficiently.\n--------------§!"

To the mages, this is a welcomed status quo but even to Emperors it is a dead end for any real noble initiative. Should the parliament be anointed with real legal power, the Emperor could rally a unified nobility to confront any domestic or legal issues regardless of any opinion of the mages.\n--------------"

 flavour_eoa_reforms.1.d:0 ""Hear ye, hear ye!"\n\n\nThe criers of Tellum have announced the promulgation of a new law: the Imperial Parliament has affirmed temple rights in the Empire, guaranteeing the immediate status of the ecclesiastical princes to Empire and Emperor. The Emperor’s envoys have been dispatched to every prince of the Empire to demand their recognition of the decision."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.1.a:0 "The Emperor protects them…?"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.1.b:0 "Blessings upon the Emperor!"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.1.c:0 "My will be done."

 flavour_eoa_reforms.1.f:0 "We have privileges of our own."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.2.t:0 "Nobles of The Wand"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.2.d:0 "Magical ability had long been considered a traditional sign of nobility in the lands that would form the Empire of Anbennar. It was - is still - said that magic was a sign of the manifest will of the gods, that this divine blessing, which granted the right to rule, could be passed down through blood, thus forming the foundation for a magic-wielding aristocracy. But when Delian Whitecloak founded the Empire, it was turned on its head: magic was not granted to nobles to signify their divinely blessed position, but rather nobility was conferred upon the great mages who had assisted in the creation of Anbennar, and who had to assume the positions and titles of the noble houses and warlord dynasties who had been destroyed in the process. \n\nEmperor [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] has signed into law the restoration of this ancient practice, establishing a new class of Nobles of the Wand, recruited from those whose vaunted magical power has earned them the rights of nobility. Many prominent magisters and battlemages from across the Empire were in attendance at the first ennobling ceremony in Anbenncóst, where they swore to uphold the dream of Anbennar, and to be true and faithful to the Emperor and the Empire."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.2.a:0 "The mages are pleased with this new development, but where will their true loyalties lie?"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.2.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] was in attendance, naturally."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.3.t:0 "The Special Law Enjoining Artificery Practitioners"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.3.d:0 "With a stroke of a pen, the Emperor has restored order to Anbennar! Henceforth, all artificers, their workshops, their employees, and all their associates must be fully licensed and overseen by local magical authorities, and maximally compliant with a wide ranging set of rules and regulations. This order is enacted to ensure the safety of all imperial citizens, and fair access to Damestear and other magical reagents for all mages!\n\nAdditionally, a special patenting process will be implemented to ensure rogue artificers do not endanger health or market stability with their dangerous and frankly unnatural competition. All their works will be registered with the Magisterium, and the most dangerous devices deemed too dangerous will, of course, be banned, and their manufacture stringently punished. The Magisterium has been tasked with ensuring the full compliance with this law across the whole Empire, and their budget has been increased to meet their increased need for personnel and resources to enforce this mandate."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.3.a:0 "There is a single light of invention, and the mages have thrown a curtain before it."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.3.b:0 "Try to find a compromise!"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.4.t:0 "The Order of Imperial War Wizards"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.4.d:0 "The young mage bowed, and presented a sealed scroll. Its contents identified her as a recent graduate from the Imperial War Mage Academy in Anbenncóst, and as a certified member of the new Order of Imperial War Wizards. This most recent edict of the Emperor, establishing that aforementioned Order, had caused some consternation across the Empire with some, including more than one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s own advisors, arguing that this constituted a worrying new overreach by the magocrats. ‘As if the Great Geas hadn’t gone far enough’, as one advisor put it. ‘The Magisterium has snapped up the best war mages from across the Empire, and we’re getting back their dregs!’\n\nBut this fresh-faced mage, eager to assist the regular troops, and, more importantly, eager to prove herself under the ordinary chain of command as a powerful and sorely-needed battlemage, hardly seemed an agent of magocratic control. Her bubbly demeanor almost seemed infectious, inspiring the troops to serve their liege with their utmost efforts. As she would not tire to proclaim, the Order of Imperial War Wizards was only here to help!"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.4.a:0 "They seem trustworthy!"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.5.t:0 "The Second Mages’ Peace"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.5.d:0 ""My friends, fellow princes, people of the Empire: I congratulate you. Finally, there is peace. Finally, the wars between us have ended. Finally, we are truly united in mind and deed.\n\nCenturies ago, a group of extraordinary mages shared the dream that their extraordinary abilities could achieve an extraordinary end: a realm united, at peace. They cast down the warlords of the Interregnum and built this Empire. It lasted, for a time. Neglect, vanity, greed, petty strifes, bloody feuds, and foreign enemies, all sought to tear this Empire asunder.\n\nBut I congratulate you. We remembered where we came from. We remembered the power of magic. We remembered what can be achieved with the will to use that power. And now there is peace. The Empire is whole. We have persevered! Against all odds, we have won!"\n\nThe Emperor’s words have been promulgated throughout the Empire. There will be no more wars between the Princes of the Empire, and all ongoing conflicts shall be brought to a swift end by the might of the Order of Imperial War Wizards. All disputes between the princes shall henceforth be relegated to the Imperial courts."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.5.a:0 "...We’d better call upon a good lawyer in Crothán…"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.6.t:0 "Marshal of the Empire"
 flavour_eoa_reforms.6.d:0 "As [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] pursues the process of Imperial Reform, [Emperor.Monarch.GetSheHe] has consistently needed to rely upon the noble houses of the Empire for support. Any reform thus requires the backing of the Imperial aristocracy.\n\nThe Imperial Parliament has now presented a law to the Dove Throne to establish a number of high offices to oversee the various functions of the Imperial government, with each of these offices the hereditary responsibility of a particular prince. While some of these appointments will proceed without question, like conferring upon the Count of Konwell an official set of responsibilities for the Imperial Archive or bestowing merely ceremonial roles, one particular office is a contentious one: that of the Marshal of the Imperial Army, an evolution of the office of the Marshal of the Empire. The Marshal of the Imperial Army will command the Empire’s joint military forces, which makes this, obviously, a position not to be handed out lightly.\n\nThe Marshal of the Empire has long been a title borne by the Duke of Istralore, but this is an opportunity either to find a more suitable candidate… or to honor Istralore’s traditional rights."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.6.k:0 "This requires much consideration… Ask again in a year."
 flavour_eoa_reforms.6.l:0 "...Why would someone else command the Imperial Army?"

Dozens of imperial princes and hundreds of their retinues vying for hearings, judicial compromises over disputes, and favor with the Emperor in administering their lands.\n\nThe Imperial Court strains under the weight of every region and so decentralization is being considered.

 flavour_eoa_reforms.9.d:0 "The Electoral Council was supposed to bring balance to the Empire. There were three Electors for the Empire’s minorities: Silverforge, Beepeck, and Moonhaven. There were three Electors representing the human majority - Damescrown, Pearlsedge, and Istralore. Two on the western shore of the Dameshead, two in the Empire’s north, and two in East Dameria. Each one represented an imperial office - though, granted, only that of the Imperial Marshal ever retained any relevance.\n\nHowever, there was always one Elector unlike the others: the Magisterium. Centrally located, with multiple exclaves and extraterritorial offices, representing the class of mages rather than a distinct people, and whose former imperial office was that of the emperorship itself, the Magisterium has always had more power at its fingertips - often literally - than the other Electors.\n\nBy imperial decree and the will of parliament, a solution has been found. For too long have there been calls for a new addition to the ranks of the Electorate, one who would defend the rights of any number of underrepresented groups: Gnomes, or Alenics, or the Escanni, or even half-orcs as a people. And now, a new Elector will hold its seat on behalf of all these unheard voices of Anbennar. And, unofficially, they will serve as a useful foil against the Magisterium."

Much of the groundwork had been laid out well before this day, overseen by the leading reformist nobles. Every article had been carefully drafted to respect the legal norms and traditions of every part of the Empire, to formalize and harmonize the many feudal laws and oaths underpinning the obligations of the many Princes, and to adequately define, delegate, and balance the rights and powers of every prince alongside the institutions of the Imperial Court.\n\nThe document does not purport to create new laws, but rather to enshrine the present, unwritten system of the Empire and its principles into a single text. Every article had been agreed to before it ever received the signatures of the Emperor and the Electors. This day, though a momentous occasion, has not been met with fanfare or rebellion, and will chiefly be remembered as a single, dreaded paragraph in the history books of students in the distant future.\n\nBut make no mistake. On this day, as a matter of law, the constituent realms of the Empire of Anbennar became irrevocably bound together, a momentous step on the road towards complete unity. The day this unity will be finally realised is not far off now."
