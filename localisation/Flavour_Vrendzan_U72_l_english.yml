  flavour_vrendzan.1.t:0 "Settlement Efforts"
  flavour_vrendzan.1.d:0 "Boats crash into hidden rocks. Small groups of explorers disappear as blizzards suddenly appear. Kobolds that would readily have braved the open ocean now fear sheets of ice and monsters they’ve never seen or heard of.\n\nThe kobolds of Vrendzan, once the foremost explorers of the Dragoncoast, have been cowed by Aelantir’s horrors. Almost unanimously they speak of scaling back expeditions and focusing on building up settlements- ideally with extensive defences. Admittedly, it does appear that we have explored as much as would benefit us at the moment. There’s no telling how long we will be able to make our home here before the Cannorians attempt to end our nation. Taming the coast and creating a civilisation capable of existing on its own is of vital importance.\n\nBut there are a few dissenting voices. Perhaps we have not adventured far enough. Perhaps there is more to see, relics to uncover that would justify the loss in kobolds. A choice must be made."
  flavour_vrendzan.1.a:0 "We must rest, consolidate and defend our territory. It is the way of the kobolds."
  flavour_vrendzan.1.b:0 "Nonsense, we aren’t named kocowards. We will explore and adventure until this continent is laid bare to us."

  flavour_vrendzan.2.t:0 "Drozma Tur Found"
  flavour_vrendzan.2.d:0 "A rumour. An error in translation. Hearing things. Reading too much into symbols. A thousand half excuses made to avoid getting our hopes up. But every kobold knows what awaits for us in the Ynn. A dragon, Varlengeilt the Green. Centuries have passed since we’ve heard of one active, much less seen one in the scales. Already thousands of kobolds have flooded into the Ynn, determined to serve their lord. More conservative members of the nation are cautious though. The dragon cult does not revere a lone dragon, much less one so young. We can, and we will, add him to the mythos but we will not abandon Nimrith, Tayekan, Malliath and so many others for Varlengeilt alone. Yet the allure of finally worshipping a dragon we can see – a lord we can commune with and work under… It is not hard to see why so many are clamouring for us to go all in on our worship of this new god."
  flavour_vrendzan.2.a:0 "Varlengeilt will become the centre of the cult. All dragons will be venerated, but he will be worshipped."
  flavour_vrendzan.2.b:0 "A new dragon merely means new stories and new reasons to worship. Everything has changed, but we will not abandon our old ways."

 ###DECISIONS###

  vrendzan_nation_title:0 "Found Vrendzan"
  vrendzan_nation_desc:0 "Be it from necessity or desire, there is a rise in the number of kobold settlers in Dalaire, and a rift is growing with those we left behind in Cannor. It won’t be easy to survive on our own, but our lives in Cannor weren’t that comfortable either."
  vrendzan_decision_tt:0 "Fewer than §Y15§! owned provinces outside of §YNorth Aelantir§!"
  vrendzan_decision_effect_tt:0 "Transfer a portion of development from owned provinces to North Aelantir."
