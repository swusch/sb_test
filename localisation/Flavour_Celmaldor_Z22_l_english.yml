 z22_defend_inlet_desc:0 "In this age of decline, raids from monsters and reavers plague the commercial lanes of the sea of storms. We can’t let it stand as it is, but we lack the position to immediately deal with these threats. By striking at the Greenscale clan at our border, we may at least end the threat of kobold incursion on the city of Deland and reavings through the Mawriver inlet. Then in time we can use these new standing grounds to block the reavers their pass out of the Giants Grave sea, and hopefully also return our rule to the gnomish Storm Isles."

 z22_gnomers_storm_title:0 "Gnomers on the Storm"
 z22_gnomers_storm_desc:0 "During earlier centuries we had many villages and islands of the storm gnomes within our trade league; a devastating war against Bjarnrik in the later 1300s, however, saw both nations' interests in the Sea of Storms collapse. But we learn and we endure. Now the isles have been subjugated under Nimscodd, whose powerbase lies far away on the other side of the dragon coast. Were any competent admiral to lead a reconquest of the Storm Isles, reclaiming these territories ought to be a simple matter."

 z22_lonely_voyages_title:0 "Lonely Voyages"
 z22_lonely_voyages_desc:0 "Elves are known for a love of the sea, and many of our ships strafe along routes far into the Northern Thaw and Uelos’ Lament, for little reason other than to once more be far out on the seas of our forebears' voyage. With tales of the rediscovery of our lost homeland carried loud upon the wind, the time has come to encourage these more wayward sailors – let them sail as far out as possible, let them bring us tales of what was home."

 z22_old_world_anchor_title:0 "Old World Anchor"
 z22_old_world_anchor_desc:0 ""I’m not going to put it any simpler to you; we can’t make our people create any footholds in Aelantir without making it profitable. You will need to cave in and invest heavily in this ‘Dalaire’ land, because without some starting help and a safe port where goods can start being sold, we’re not going to have this colonial venture amount in more than a few eccentrics’ suicides." - Lord Ellodan II Whitespear, Private Correspondence."

 z22_multicultural_colonies_title:0 "Multicultural Colonies"
 z22_multicultural_colonies_desc:0 "We have consulted the numbers from both the 1100s – when the Delandian Acts were first signed – and now post the recent renewal of the legislation. The profit increase we’re enjoying from a deeper labour market can’t be denied, and the supply of talent and manpower in the workforce is likely the biggest contributor to this. So to increase both the economic growth of our colonies as well as growth in territory we should definitely enforce the same laws of equality in these regional administrations. This investment might have a slower payoff than when we implemented the laws back home but if there’s anything we do have it’s time to wait."

 z22_frozen_passage_title:0 "The Frozen Passage"
 z22_frozen_passage_desc:0 "There is a certain joy all Reachman sailors find in navigating difficult waters, and the Broken Sea thus proves a magnet for daring traders, despite its deadliness. Bold enough sailors can make a killer profit bringing goods from the far Eordan nations back to eager buyers in Celmaldor. Even this smaller daredevil trade is very lucrative, so it would be a missed opportunity indeed not to make the incentive bigger for our Merchants and Clans, as well as their Eordan counterparts. Various ideas have been raised to try making these freezing sea lanes more safe, but we need not reach to any ridiculous concepts: icebreakers, thick layers of tar, and metal lined sides have kept trade flowing in Gerudia for millennia, and there is certainly no need to overcomplicate things now. "

 z22_emancipate_aelantir_title:0 "Emancipate Aelantir"
 z22_emancipate_aelantir_desc:0 "We look upon the passing age and the new colonies born in the Elvenhome, and we see fresh new beginnings stymied by the slow suffocation of our western kin. Not only that, but the nature of the distribution of profits within our colonial empire drastically favours the people in the Reach, working almost like a ships’ pump to extract wealth from the people who so bravely settled the old world at our behest. A good and healthy economy relies on mutually profitable exchange, not a one sided hoarding. Some older elven traders and bankers predict this trend to be profitable now, but have disastrous effects on the growth of the colonies in the future, leading of course to less profit here in time. Put simply, their interests are ours. It’s unclear exactly what we can do about this, but the main thing to do is reconstruct the relationship between us and our colonies. Our trade league does not suffer from this issue of exploitation; thus the prevailing consensus is that we should repatriate our colonial subjects as Giesadh, retaining their trade within our league and customs barrier but granting independence for these new colonial governments."

 z22_elfhome_allies_title:0 "Elfhome Allies"
 z22_elfhome_allies_desc:0 "The rebirth of our colonies into independent nations has slowly started to pay off. Their cities are large and their production capacity greater than ever, thanks to their membership in our trade league. We do have a small issue in that our lessened direct control in the region means foreign powers have conspired to compete with our influence in nations who were once part of our domain. Unfortunately for them, with sufficient goodwill between us and our former colonies as well as other constituents in North Aelantir we can easily institute some policies of mercantile control once more, denying these interlopers access to the profits of our Silver League."

 z22_northern_liberation_title:0 "Northern Liberation"
 z22_northern_liberation_desc:0 "Sometimes our very fundamentally Elven tendency to make decisions looking to the far future, instead of favouring instant profit, makes us less wealthy in the moment than those willing to make hasty and less long-term moves. It has been like this with our liberation of our colonies; they make us money, but probably less than if we kept them in chains as other nations do. and their other benefits are great but not enough to stop our wealthy and powerful from grumbling when they see treasure fleets landing in other Cannorian ports. The remedy to this is simple: break the chains on all these colonies and include them in our trade league; we would deny our rivals their treasure hauls and secure much more trade league profit in one fell swoop."

 z22_control_tolls_title:0 "Control the Tolls"
 z22_control_tolls_desc:0 "Any Trade League despises pirates, ours included. The problem is there are quite a lot of pirates in Gerudia because their local customs of raised status in society being derived from heroism, which in turn is proven through bringing back battle-won wealth from abroad. Then there’s also the religion, which celebrates these heroes in songs spread out to everybody in the population, the two traditions combine together into a veritable pirate growing plantation. Their sailors are, while admittedly good, no match for a good elven captain’s centuries of experience and thus we can defeat them with enough effort. Should we wrest their beloved frost bridges from them as well, thus controlling enough of the Serpentshead trade to force customers away from their trading havens and stolen goods, we can put their reaving practices in a noose… at least on this side of the passes."

 z22_curtail_clans_title:0 "Curtail the Clans"
 z22_curtail_clans_desc:0 "Whitespear, Icewind, and Frozentide are the largest of the elven merchant clans, but they are not the only ones. Smaller families come and go, usually rising through one elf’s clever investment or successful risky trading voyage. Whatever their origin, the clans are the basis of rule in our city and its confederation; so mighty are they that they hire their own armies, which we simply borrow in our wars to supplement our meagre levies. An attempt was made by Ultarion Frozentide in his waning years and short term as Prince to build a national military independent of, the clans but he died before his plan could get underway. Since then the scheme has been on the backburner but we could start it anew if the current Prince had enough support… or a small enough resistance."

 z22_tides_profit_title:0 "The Tides of Profit"
 z22_tides_profit_desc:0 "A good skill for any merchant is to leverage faith in their abilities to secure investors; the best way to build this faith is to prove your worth, which our republic has been doing for centuries. So whilst a small merchant can get a few crowns to buy a new building, we can get a king’s ransom and use it to buy a city’s worth. It will significantly speed up the process of building ourselves a proper army if we simply buy out the existing military infrastructure of the clans. Let’s cash in some of the goodwill people have for us and get funds for just such a project."

 z22_disband_private_armies_title:0 "Disband the Private Armies"
 z22_disband_private_armies_desc:0 "The time has come. We are powerful enough that we need not tolerate independent armies within our territory and can force the clans to give in to our demands. But the years of effort building our national army are not over; for some time still we will need to iron out flaws in the system, as well as restructure our officer core to make sure the republic’s army is a worthy entity. "

 z22_reinvigorate_harbour_title:0 "Reinvigorate the Harbour"
 z22_reinvigorate_harbour_desc:0 "The White Harbour, the soul of the city of Celmaldor, lies wasting. Her empty docks silently wear away into the waves. In some ways it was a folly of our predecessors to build such a massive harbour for ships which had no reason ever to sail here, but in the spirit of the effort lies their hope for what our new home could be. It might not be possible to build such a huge harbour as was envisioned, one so large as to host the entire migrant fleet, but it would surely be a sensible venture to repair our beloved White Harbour and ensure we do not lose this gift from our forebears forever."

 z22_loyal_army_title:0 "A Loyal Army"
 z22_loyal_army_desc:0 "Outside the Palace of Commerce stands a parade of fully armed Elves and Humans, their spears and muskets pointing high into the greying skies. These soldiers are not mercenaries of the merchant clans or foreign allies, they are the army of our Republic. We have succeeded through the careful establishment of military infrastructure and the erosion of clan influence on military matters to end the stagnation of our military and field a fighting force worthy of our confederation and trade league. "For Maldorian and the White Harbour – for Freedom!""

 z22_proof_concept_title:0 "Proof of Concept"
 z22_proof_concept_desc:0 "We aren’t as completely washed up as it seems. The effort to rebuild parts of the White Harbour has proceeded well enough, and the newly deepened harbour, allowing for direct docking of large ships, has been thoroughly appreciated by merchants unloading their goods. A harbour is more than a place to store ships, though – it is also a place to make them. The White Harbour should have a capacity for ship construction commensurate to its size and prestige; so we should invigorate our shipbuilding to allow us to sensibly build such quantities of the sleekly maneuverable and well-modernised elven ships in which we take pride. "

 z22_new_directions_title:0 "New Directions"
 z22_new_directions_desc:0 "Each clan was a little lost after their armies were taken away, but they seem to have stabilised. The Whitespears have gone all in on the profits of Aelantir, putting obscene amounts of money into our new world colonies as well as development projects in ruinborn nations. The Icewinds are as trade focused as ever; they perhaps lost the least, as their trade fleets remain their own and these now prance across the waves larger than ever, bringing control to ports far and wide. The Frozentide Clan reinvented their weapons workshops and army training buildings into tooling forges and a mix of schools for aspiring tradesmen and offices of law enforcement. Though robbed of their former glory in fighting the wars of our country, the clans are now more prestigious than ever before."

 z22_burgeoning_harbour_title:0 "Burgeoning Harbour"
 z22_burgeoning_harbour_desc:0 "It’s actually surprising to say but the White Harbour has become so popular and our nation so wealthy in trade that it is close to reaching capacity. Considering the size of the place, this feels almost ridiculous, but it’s hardly a bad thing. Celmaldor proper may be a bit rowdy with all the sailors passing through, but the money more than makes this worth it and the entire Serpentshead is teeming with new businesses, housing and cultural attractions as a result of the trade influx. It has to be an utmost priority to expand the White Harbour to finally shift the wave-breakers further to sea and raise new quays, in order to ensure these benefits grow even greater."

 z22_commercialised_magic_title:0 "Commercial Magic"
 z22_commercialised_magic_desc:0 "The issue with making money through magic is scaleability. One mage can only do so much, and while you can set up a huge infrastructure of sigils, runes and engravings along with hundreds of trained mages to perform larger consistent works of the arcane, it’s just more profitable to invest in the mundane. That was, at least, until the spread of artificery. Now this new magical system popularised by the Gnomes, Goblins, and Kobolds of our realm has taken to the workshops like wildfire, throughput is soaring and new wonderful goods are reaching the markets every year. A Merchant Republic must empower those who will make its people money – thus will our Prince empower the Artificers."

 z22_halanns_greatest_port_title:0 "Halann's Greatest Port"
 z22_halanns_greatest_port_desc:0 "They compare it to Tianlou’s spiderweb of piers, to Anbenncost’s great elvendocks, to the mighty bridge of Isobelin, to the Treasure Fleet’s home in Zurkanrek, to the Hold of Ovdal Tungr, to the Lizard Port of the Summer Isles, to Sramaya, the Kheions and the Baashidi merfolk ports. But such places do not match the scale of our snowy white cays, the number of carefully wound wooden piers and the number of ships moored, coming, leaving, or being built or repaired. There may be cities larger than Celmaldor, but there are no ports larger and more beautiful than the White Harbour of Maldorian’s dreams."

 z22_silver_league_desc:0 "The symbol of Celmaldor is a silver chain connected by the bite of two serpentine heads. It serves too as the seal of our Trade League: the chain is made of many links representing the smaller cities whose commerce we connect into one united force. The unity and goodwill of our alliance has grown lesser in recent years, so it would make sense that we spread some diplomatic favour around in order to reinvigorate our constituent members."

 z22_invest_allies_title:0 "Invest in Our Allies"
 z22_invest_allies_desc:0 "Bayvic is in our sights as the main obstacle toward uniting the Blue Reach under our trade league and confederation. Though the largest city of the Coast of Vics, they do not share their wealth as readily as do we, leading to some dissatisfaction in their trade league which we could take advantage of. Should the members of the Bayvic league see our trade league member cities prosper significantly beyond theirs, that success can be used as strong leverage to ensure Bayvic’s fall in standing, hopefully eliminating their league and allowing us to swoop in and assimilate the remaining cities."

 z22_revive_storvik_title:0 "Reviving Storvic"
 z22_revive_storvik_desc:0 "After the Second Blue Reachman War of Independence ended in victory, our city, along with the other Vics of the Blue Reachmen, united into a single alliance known as the Storvic League. This alliance lasted for many decades, tested in conflicts against Gerudian reavers, petty Reachman kings and even a Sea Troll invasion, but it would ultimately fall to a mix of grudges and internal competition between the new independent polities. With our trade league poised as the only real commercial alliance in the Blue Reach, we could claim successorship to Storvic, however this would require finally dealing with the Bayvic issue. The choice in the matter is theirs: either they join with our league in a favoured position we shall name Giesadh, or we will be forced to conquer them. There is no longer space for a competitor to the Celmaldorian confederation in the Western Alenic Reach."

 z22_united_magnates_title:0 "United Magnates"
 z22_united_magnates_desc:0 "The nations of our Alenic cousins in absence of Merchant Clans have a type of businessman-landowner figure known as Magnates. These magnates keep their own councils where the most influential of them dictate certain trade and production matters within the nation. The issue for us is that every polity in the trade league has their own magnates and they don’t work well together. We anticipate significant difficulties early on, but we can get them to unify into one council across the trade league if we motivate them by significantly sponsoring their industries. As a bonus we can then ask them to fully invest in a united policy of forestry, giving the trade league access to hoards of good timber without the forests being completely cleared."

 z22_amend_act_title:0 "Amend the Acts"
 z22_amend_act_desc:0 "The Delandian Act of Equality is the basis of Laws on which the human cities of Mawdock and Deland were brought into the same country as Celmaldor, creating the confederation of cities which we know as our nation today. It guarantees certain fundamental rights for all humans in the land, but it has some flaws we need to address. For one, it is set in stone and cannot be changed; this can make new legislation awkward as it always has to work around the Act. Secondly, it is often interpreted as referring specifically to Blue Reachman humans, leaving for example Dalric citizens in a disadvantageous position. We should fix these issues: allow the Act to be changed to include more than just humans and also ensure that it definitely applies to all humans, not just those of the original two cities it was used to integrate. "

 z22_third_act_title:0 "The Third Act"
 z22_third_act_desc:0 "They’re not gnelves, they’re gnomes, and they don’t fall under the Acts of Deland despite gnomes having lived in our Confederacy and trade league for centuries. Generally it hasn’t been a bother, since talented gnomes are quite readily employed across the nation, but now that we administer all of the Storm Isles it’s become a bit of an issue. The gnomes in our country aren’t just well off trading families with interests in the city anymore; they come from all walks of life and thus some of them are being thoroughly exploited in their lack of officially defined rights. In order to end this inefficient system, we can simply add a gnomish article to the Delandian acts and thereby make them properly integrated in our nation."

 z22_greater_reach_title:0 "Greater Reach"
 z22_greater_reach_desc:0 "Our league isn’t just a Blue Reachman league or an Alenic Reach league anymore; we control all of Gerudia through the routes of our commerce. People in Revrhavn can produce goods and sell them in Cedevik with minimal tariff and great safety in the crossing. It is a new dawn for all merchants of northern Cannor as the riches pile in and the cities keep growing. Once more we can’t stagnate our position, we should take advantage of this situation to begin integrating cities into our confederation and growing Celmaldor. It is good to have Gerudia be part of the trade league, it will be better to have it be part of the country."

 z22_toward_unification_title:0 "Toward Unification"
 z22_toward_unification_desc:0 "We have brought the Blue Reach from two leagues into one and from one league into one nation. Under our administration, the cities of the Western Alenic reach are more prosperous than ever before and people marvel at the benefits of being brought into the Celmaldorian Confederation. We should not waste this feeling and this momentum, we should speed up the integration of our trade league members across all gerudia so that the entire subcontinent can be brought under one grey banner"

 z22_prosperitys_champion_desc:0 ""The Elven Years is the name given to the era during which Celmaldor unified their trade league into one country. They were characterised by solid growth of cities and the decline of subsistence farming, as well as an increase in the level of education in the common citizen, mostly through being taught to speak Elven in weekend schools. Whilst many complained about the elves taking firmer grasp over Gerudia, they were drowned out by the people who saw their lives improve during this process, and this century of integration proved the catalyst to Celmaldor rapid rise to prominent status on the world stage." - A History of the Silver League, Acromar síl Napesbay, 1745."

Now the Confederation includes the entirety of Gerudia, which whilst glorious is a bit of an issue for our systems of representation and election. The elections are by design unfairly centred around Celmaldor at the moment, but we could change this to more equally account for merchants across the subcontinent. Along with this change, we can reform our teaching of Elven to the merchants into a more centralised and accessible education system, as well as finally end the exclusivity of the Prince’s elected office which the Merchant Clans so long have almost kept entirely to themselves."

 z22_council_trade_title:0 "Councils of Trade"
 z22_council_trade_desc:0 "Connections are important to trade, and due to the amount of trade within our league, connection to us has become invaluable for any trader in the world. There is no place as rich as our trading ports, and thus we find ourselves in a position to influence the world a bit more than would be expected for a Merchant Republic locked away in a cold corner of the world. Of course, the troubles of foreign lands are a matter for their residents and not us, really – what the Confederation truly seeks is the opportunity to make more money. Owing to our reputation as reliable trading partners, are sure to be countries around who are willing to work alongside us to set some rules and prices which favour our trade league above other parties; by such mutually beneficial agreements between many nations, we can increase the flow of trade across the world even further."

We laid the beginnings of a more global trade network by the establishments of the international trade councils, but we can go further. Our trade league should logically reach a state where we receive goods from across the world, so let us redraft the Giesadh appointments and get out there. Any nation in the world may be a link in our silver chain of commerce, and all peoples are welcome in the anchoring clasp of Celmaldor."

 z22_world_anchor_title:0 "Anchor of the World"
 z22_world_anchor_desc:0 ""It is odd for such an urbanised polity as Celmaldor to be so heavily forested. The same is true of the whole Serpentshead, but perhaps it is due to an elven streak that the Reachman nation manages to maintain massive industry without compromising their environment and nature. We have seen this echoed elsewhere: the companies in Sarhal prefer to work with the jungle rather than chop it down and even the marshes of the Alen have been kept in order, all the better to make great profits from peat.. Yes, it is indeed odd how such a small population of elves and humans, in such a remote corner of the world, have managed to influence it so deeply. It is as all is kept steady in this unstable age of industry by the securely planted silver anchor in the White Harbour." - A History of the Silver League, Acromar síl Napesbay, 1745."

The Greatwoods of which our forests are but a small part stretch far into the south, where Gawedi magnates cut down acres of trees with no care for the future. If the vengeful Adshaws can be removed from the path to Gawed, we can surely secure some lucrative deals with the right Magnate; we may be elves, but as Reachmen we’re a lot more Alenic than any Imperial or Lencori trading partner."

It is not really such a threat which we need to destroy to survive, but the Gawedi kingdom’s northern border, that of their Moorman vassals, does lie awfully close to our capital city. It would be far more convenient if the border was ruled by a less domineering and more amiable nation, and the Moorman clans definitely wouldn’t mind being independent. It’s a risky move; either we could agitate the clans to revolt and sponsor their wars or we could directly strike at Gaweton ourselves. For it to work we will need strong fortifications and bases of operation by the moors."

We shouldn’t grow complacent, though – there is room for further integration of these cities. They’re not yet part of the actual Celmaldorian confederation, after all. To facilitate bringing them into the nation we can expand our deliberative lawmaking systems, allowing for representation of more cities in the policymaking of our Prince’s government. It might not be possible to start integration immediately, but for now we could begin by expanding the status of Giesadh to any city in the Blue Reach."

All these people are part of the commerce and prosperity our Confederacy enjoys, it won’t do to start forcing them to change their faith and annoy them if it affects our profits. So by the grace of Ara, we shall draft a treaty by which these heretics and heathens may practice freely, in order for a smoother clinking of coin into our pockets."

Towns have become cities, farming villages towns, and the raiding and fishing has turned to trade and craftsmanship. But the region is still a bit behind in growth, lagging behind the Reach as a little brother struggling to follow his older sibling. In time this gap will close on its own, but it would make more money for us if it closed sooner. So let’s invest into building up cities in Dalr and Olavlund, enough that they can stand rich and prosperous; we helped the Blue and White Reach develop, after all, so why not the new Black Reach too?"

I’d love to know… but obviously I’m not so rude as to ask an artificer their secrets. No, instead I implore you, Ultarion, invest in these new Gerudian inventors springing up in the northern cities.

Forts on all borders with designs inspired by Bal Vroren, Urvik’s Rock and Frostwall will keep enemy armies far from our heartlands. and the world's largest navy, supported by huge batteries and covered bays along the coast, will render any approaching navy into flotsam before any threat is upon our harbours. To our foes we are the Reach because nobody has the range to touch us."

Now we can, for example, capture blizzards in winter and let them loose upon a besieging foe, or freeze a river allowing us a most rapid advance. Above such techniques, however, we rely on the simple tenacity of our soldiers. They are experienced in the worst conditions, equipped with the most robust armour our millenia of wealth can afford and trained by generals and instructors who have seen centuries of battles. The downside of investing so much into the soldiers is that it’s really costly to replace them, but we lose so few that this generally balances out."

 flavour_celmaldor.1.t:0 "Call of the Endless Sea"
 flavour_celmaldor.1.d:0 "Our recruitment efforts for explorers have been lamentably scattershot as clans, the naval staff, the mercantile class, and the dockyards fight over who in their midst is suitable for the position. Amidst this general ferment, one explorer has risen to the top, forcing all the competing parties to admit to his merit. Úrvion Wavedancer is a famous merchant captain and a notorious eccentric who once boasted a troll for a crew member. He has come to the court in [Root.Capital.GetName] to pay his respects and offer service to Celmaldor."
 flavour_celmaldor.1.a:0 "Toward the stormy horizon, then!"

 flavour_celmaldor.2.t:0 "Our Explorer Disappears"
 flavour_celmaldor.2.d:0 "Grave news from Aelantir, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our most competent explorer, Úrvion Wavedancer, has mysteriously disappeared whilst sailing near the newly-dubbed Ruined Sea. The other vessels in his flotilla have returned in good order, but he and his ship are nowhere to be found. Mages have even attempted to look below the ocean surface and found nothing of note. Search efforts are continuing."
 flavour_celmaldor.2.a:0 "Strange and alarming. My condolences to the family."

 flavour_celmaldor.3.t:0 "The One Who Returned"
 flavour_celmaldor.3.d:0 ""He’s strange" were the first words that fell out of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s mouth when Úrvion Wavedancer took his leave after returning to the court for the first time since his reappearance among the living. Strange was a good word for it, too. Talking to him was inherently unnerving and confusing. The Wavedancer that most of Celmaldor had known had been something of an eccentric. But the Úrvion that has come back with his ship has been almost ... eerie. Any questions one asks him are met with strange and almost incomprehensible responses.\n\nWe might have sent him away to take the waters if "eerie" was the only word that could be used to describe him. However, he has returned with a broadly expanded toolkit of skills, more competent as an explorer and even as an admiral writ large than ever before. So it goes without saying that, even though we are disturbed, we will accept his services once again."
 flavour_celmaldor.3.a:0 "Good, I, uh, think."

 flavour_celmaldor.4.t:0 "Soldiers of the Reach"
 flavour_celmaldor.4.d:0 "The question of the composition and organization of our military has become contentious lately. Whereas recruitment will no doubt be open to both major races, human and elven officers have already launched into raucous debates about who should form the core of our military. Ultimately, it distills down to two arguments, out of which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will have to choose one."
 flavour_celmaldor.4.a:0 "Human numbers will bolster our forces."
 flavour_celmaldor.4.b:0 "Elven discipline must be the basis of our army."

 flavour_celmaldor.5.t:0 "Elves of the Old World"
 flavour_celmaldor.5.d:0 "The latest reports from the newly-rediscovered land of Aelantir have revealed a potentially earth-shattering development. It is clear that the Day of Ashen Skies was not enough to destroy the elven race in what is now Aelantir. So-called "Ruinborn" elves remained in place amidst the ruins of the Forebears and rebuilt civilizations from the ashes of the old.\n\nThe Ruinborn have been affected in various ways by the changed environments in which they found themselves, so much so that the more pedantic thinkers even debate the utility of a single term to describe all Ruinborn. Some cannot even be called sentient; others have remained in a sort of primitive tribalism; still others have devised states and philosophies of similar complexity to our own."
 flavour_celmaldor.5.a:0 "Distant cousins? It is well, I suppose."

 flavour_celmaldor.6.t:0 "The Naval Specialty Question"
 flavour_celmaldor.6.d:0 "The question of specialization for the White Harbor’s naval construction has, shall we say, led to some debate amidst the naval staff and drydocks of Celmaldor. General opinion has split in two. One faction argues for the prioritization of lighter trade ships in order to project trade power. The other argues for a heavier battlefleet in order to properly defend not only our tradefleet but the interests of Celmaldor more generally.\n\nThe debate is so utterly raucous and so evenly divided that a decision will not be reached unless the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] definitively intervenes. What, then, do you conclude?"
 flavour_celmaldor.6.a:0 "The White Harbor must focus on agility."
 flavour_celmaldor.6.b:0 "Raw power is what we need."

 flavour_celmaldor.7.t:0 "Purpose Without Conflict"
 flavour_celmaldor.7.d:0 "The ancient internal commotions of the Celmaldori state are no more. Whereas the clans that form the foundation of our country’s governing elite are still influential, their worst tendencies have been reformed. Decisive action was taken to break the destructive habits of the clans through a mix of expropriations, incentives, threats, and brute force.\n\nLet there be no mistake: the clans are still influential. They could certainly cause significant trouble for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if they saw a need. Yet even at their angriest, they can no longer plunge the country into internal conflict at a whim.Their extensive land rights curtailed, they no longer personally dispose of large tracts of our territory. In short, the clans have been given a new purpose not involving conflict with us or each other - for the first time in their existence, they will support the state."

 flavour_celmaldor.8.d:0 "The migrant ships of old: how great and glorious they were! How safe they were to travel in; how reassuring were their silhouettes on the horizon! How mighty they were in protecting our people as they traveled to their intended destination! If we are to travel farther afield, and settle lands that even our distant ancestors may have known nothing about, we should contemplate returning the migrant ships to existence. Yet a difficult issue hangs over our heads: we have only stories and some assorted diagrams, which may not be enough to get things done. Many of our citizens are thus asking,"
 flavour_celmaldor.8.a:0 ""Is it even doable?""

 flavour_celmaldor.9.t:0 "Expertise of the Sea Elves"
 flavour_celmaldor.9.d:0 "A delegation of sea elves, bearing tools and resources, have arrived at our court. They have a simple offer to make: in exchange for room, board, and adequate recompense, they will assist us in constructing our renewed migrant ships.\n\nMore open-minded members of the court are practically tripping over themselves to accept the offer.

Yet, what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was looking at now was not the Galsheáh.

Upon its large, reinforced six-decker hull sat seven square-rigged masts, spanning enough sail to nigh blot out the sun upon the upper deck.\n\nThe internal composition of the ship was equally as impressive with many of the newest artificer inventions, both civilian and military, having been integrated into its systems. The vessel, as is befitting of a Migrant Ship, was designed with an emphasis on housing and self-sufficiency, providing quarters, storage and fishing decks capable of housing and sustaining multiple hundreds of non-personnel alongside the crew itself.\n\nWhile the Núr Galsheáh was designed with an emphasis on civilian lodging, it had still been lined with extensive military implements, such as sophisticated artificer cannons, so that the Migrant Ship would be more than capable of defending itself.\n\nThough it was a wonder of artificer expertise, the Núr Galsheáh would be expensive to maintain and considerably less maneuverable than a traditional ship.

The ship was supposed to have gotten back a week from now, but thanks to the latest advancement in magical technology, it has been able to travel back quicker and safer than was previously possible.\n\n The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asks to be able to ride on the ship.

To the shock of all but the inventors, a cone of freezing cold is cast through the ship’s cannon, flash-freezing the surrounding seawater into ad-hoc ordnance.\n\n On the coast, the nearest vegetation is frozen solid. Loose-hanging parts fall to the ground with a violent crash. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], violently shivering, leads the audience in a round of applause, which the entourage joins in, rather hoping it will warm their hands."

How didn’t it spoil?"\n\nThe captain laughs boisterously and answers with a voice like a bullhorn. "Good question, young one! It’s our latest invention - we call it the Sustaining Ark. We managed to put together a special, uh, cooling and cleaning artificery on ships like these. It makes sure that people don’t get sick and goods don’t spoil in transit."\n\nThe teenager hollers in approval: "Wow! That’s cool! No more salted fish!" The laughter turns to cheers of approval.
