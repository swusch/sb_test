 mystic_accord:0 "Mystic Accord"
 mystic_accord_religion_desc:0 "The ancient and spiritual faith that used to dominate Haless before the rise of the Accretive and Transmutative Path, and is now only found in the place of its supposed origin, the Lupulan Rainforest plus small pockets of Bomdan and the Ringlet Isles. The Mystic Accord, in the simplest of terms, is the complete symbiotic union between people and the spirits scattered all across Haless. Unlike the Accretive and Transmutative Path which has evolved to separate man and spirit, the Mystic Accord holds on to the belief that humans and spirits are equal in terms of treatment. Many of the Great Spirits represent notable geographical locations or abstract features, such as the sky or the Lupulan Rainforest. The followers of the Mystic Accord depend on these Great Spirits, split between the 4 pantheons, to protect and guide the people throughout their lives, and perform many rituals to offer thanks to them."

 desc_hebat_mahar_aspect:0 "Hebat Mahar, meaning 'Great Light', is the spirit of the sun and moon, said to be one of the oldest of all spirits. Both the sun and the moon symbolize his eyes, eternally glowing to fill the world with light and peace. Many who worship him are those who value order and peace above all, making this spirit popular amongst government officials and commonfolk."

 hebat_linga_aspect:0 "Hebat Linga Pantheon"
 desc_hebat_linga_aspect:0 "Hebat Linga is the spirit known as the 'Great Sky', who encompasses almost everything above the earth. This spirit promotes the idea of unity and understanding, as no matter where someone is, they can simply look up and find Hebat Linga. Those who follow Hebat Linga primarily are notable philosophers and those who live isolated in multireligious communities."

 hebat_daga_aspect:0 "Hebat Daga Pantheon"
 desc_hebat_daga_aspect:0 "The 'Great Ocean', who is in equal parts revered and feared by the followers of the Mystic Accord due to its sheer size and depth. The followers of Hebat Daga all live near the coast, and constantly attempt to satiate the ocean with festivals and offerings to the wrathful sea. But beyond the endless horizon and tsunamis, is opportunity for trade with other peoples and travel to lands far away, who have their own names for Hebat Daga."

 hebat_tana_aspect:0 "Hebat Tana Pantheon"
 desc_hebat_tana_aspect:0 "Hebat Tana is the spirit that is, in essence, the entirety of Halann's land. Hebat Tana provides food and shelter to its followers, and promotes the idea of having more children in order to fully utilize the blessing this spirit provided to the Mystic Accord followers. Hebat Tana is favored primarily by spouses and the children due to it giving them the food to grow from."

 cinulau_dip_aspect:0 "Cinulau"
 desc_cinulau_dip_aspect:0 "Cinulau is a volatile Great Spirit, taking the form of a giant squid and being the only Great Spirit to live entirely at sea. It rarely appears near the shore so it has a distinct lack of followers outside of raiders and sailors who favor it for its attacks on any treasure vessels it encounters. Causing whirlpools and shipwrecks around the Ringlet, many of its followers collect the spoils of the wreckage by the shores or by boat after a deadly attack. Cinulau is a harsh deity, but as long as one pays proper respect while at sea they will avoid its wrath, else one might find themselves swimming with the Merfolk before long."

 lupulan_dip_aspect:0 "Lupulan"
 desc_lupulan_dip_aspect:0 "The Lupulan is the most popular spirit among the Mystic Accord, due to the Lupulan Rainforest being the last major stronghold of the faith. The Lupulan is the spirit who gives Yanglam kings their right to rule their lands and wage wars, and has thousands of small temples dedicated to it. It takes the shape of a massive monitor lizard who stalks the deep jungles, and whose sightings have been scarce since the formation of Arawkelin and the revival of the temples."

 desc_kharunyana_dip_aspect:0 "A great catfish clad in white scales, an unfathomable length beyond that of the prow and bow of Rahen’s greatest warships. This is Kharunyana, stretching his glistening splendor from bank to bank. Even though the first convulsions of his return terrified the river goers, now the dripping wet, awe-struck denizens rush to the banks to seek out Kharyunyana, jubilant in the return of their guardian. Ignoring the protestations of the Philosophers, they now partake in a vast feast of its many children and fruits."

 desc_phokhao_dip_aspect:0 "When the Mystic Accord was prevalent in Thidinkai more than a millennia ago, Phokhao was the great protector spirit who defended its followers from the hostile north. Phokhao takes on the appearance of a great peacock, its majestic tail symbolizing the large mountain range that separates Yanshen and Thidinkai. Phokhao's followers believe in a strong defense, and are rather traditional and reserved compared to the cult of Gehet Ketine."

 desc_gehet_ketine_dip_aspect:0 "One of the newer spirits that had its worship started around 930 AA, with the formation of a tribal federation called Sirtan. Its followers are mockingly called the cult of Gehet Ketine by those in the Lupulan, but the Sirtana people stay faithful to the desert who has given them protection on raids. While many who wander in Gehet Ketine die from fierce sandstorms or dehydration, the followers in this nation not only can control the sandstorms to easily ride through the desert, but can influence the timing of their raids to disappear into the sands by the time any enemy reinforcement army marches in."

 desc_hokuma_dip_aspect:0 "Hokuma is a Great Spirit that has been nearly forgotten, its worshippers long since eaten and persecuted by the devils who invaded so long ago. The Great Spirit is known for being reclusive, being able to completely change the layout and terrain of its hills just to avoid confrontation. Hokuma normally had no tangible form, instead being the energy that pervades throughout the hills. That was until being defeated by the volatile Hujan long ago, and in its moment of weakness it was imprisoned by the Oni. Hokuma’s new form became a black, dark mud has started to seep throughout the hills. Hokuma no longer wishes to be left alone, instead it aches to be free once more to seek retribution."

 desc_marutha_dip_aspect:0 "It has long been a tradition for the kings of the arid north to venture out into the dust and sand to prove worthy of their crown. No-one could say why, until the temples waned. The sands surged forth, scouring the unworthy, a lion’s roar ripping the tyrants from their thrones. The embodiment of justly-used power, those few who have reached the eye of the storm can attest to his true manifestation - a writhing cloud coalescing into a visage rippling between the menacing maw of a regal lion, and the wise gaze of a monarch just as magnificent. Only one with the heart of a lion can say they are worthy of surviving his gaze."

 desc_hukai_dip_aspect:0 "The Black Swan Hukai guards the treasures of her river jealousy, its fast and treacherous waters black and impenetrable with mountain silt. Among the people who live along the river, seeing a black swan is a fell omen, usually signifying another trading vessel being tossed beneath her waters. Springing from the same source as her sister river, the Telebei, the river is worshiped by any who have cause to brave her waters."

The many divergent perspectives and experiences that have converged once more to form the kintsugi pot that is Huzsien have certainly not made them any more coherent since. The Great Fox is now subject to both the external lobbying of the Huli Jing and Gumiho to their own ends, and the pull of their convergent wills upon a fractured mind. One can only pray that the many-thousand makers of mischief might share a sense of humor, if they wish to draw upon the emanation of their combined power."

It is Hujan, the Great Monsoon, who floods Haless, and while its flight takes it across the continent it has most of its temples and rituals from the Yanglam or Gataw people. The rare few who do worship Hujan are able to utilize the monsoon as the ideal time to attack a nation while the rains fall or put down rebels while they believe no authority would attack them during the floods."

It takes on the form of hundreds of eyes that can appear on any surface, even surfaces as abstract as the air, and is known for being the main cause for visions appearing most frequently in Tughayasa. It is said to know all the secrets of Halann, and can give messages from the future or from the past to sages, provided they use the right ceremony. Tughayasa can also summon illusions to defend its territory and portray famous events with deadly accuracy, leading it to becoming a Great Spirit worshipped by those outside the Mystic Accord."

Though he is credited with many Raheni innovations, it is nearly impossible to separate fact from legend. A long nose is said to be a sign of his favor, inherited from one of his many trunk-in-hand trysts with the lovely beings of southern Rahen. Often, brilliant advisors appear and vanish on a whim in the courts of Rahen, leaving trails of innovation and scandal in equal measure. In the end, no matter one's wisdom or restraint, Dhenbasana's sly grin will always win out."

Stepping off the ship onto the warm sands, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] felt a sudden rumbling from the island’s heart. It shifted, rising from the sea and revealing rough and caloused skin. A curious song emanates from below, demanding a response."

Ordering the column to halt, they waited with apprehension as the noise approached. Then, emerging with gentle care from the jungle wall came the shape of an enormous monitor lizard. Its reptilian gaze seemed to see only the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], still atop their oddly calm horse. With the same slow movement, it reached forth a clawed foot, extending a single long digit towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s forehead."

Even the attending healers could not dull the furor of the dark dreams, they could only sit by and wipe the sweat from their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s brow. After a month of dark ringed eyes and fitful sleep, the source of the nightmares revealed itself. A statue, monstrous in size and appearance like man half transformed into a beast, ridged with shards of black obsidian.

They rose, drawn into the garden beyond the bedroom window, clambering through it with a strange abandon. There, waiting regal in its azure gown, stood a peacock. It gave a single, forlorn cry, then fixed its gaze upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], waiting for a signal of accession."

As their dream-self began to finally dessicate from thirst, they collapsed beneath a dry, shadeless tree, its branches clutching like gnarled hands towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s painfully slow death. From the stones before their eyes emerged a scorpion, a small creature with a bulbous tail swaying under its own weight. It crept across the broken earth, crawling onto the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hand. There, it paused for a moment, staring with its many implacable eyes, stinger hanging over bare skin."
 mystic_accord_events.5.a:0 "Gehet Ketine, I accept your gift of venom and swift death."
 mystic_accord_events.5.b:0 "Better to die of thirst than suffer the scorpion’s sting."
 mystic_accord_events.6.t:0 "Come in Under the Shadow of this Red Rock"
 mystic_accord_events.6.d:0 "The Demon Hills are treacherous, wont to shift and rupture at the slightest trespass, their temperament only growing more restless since they’ve been freed from the Oni. While traveling to one of our fortified outposts within the Hills, the earth beneath our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s feet opened, plunging them down a narrow shaft into a cavern. The gloomy stoneshod cave was lit with a dim, pulsing light emerging from a twisting, matted knot of dark energy. As they moved closer, the energy began to move with frenetic desperation, squirming and writhing. The chain the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now saw binding it to the cave’s floor was taught, ready to snap. All it would take is a single swipe of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s sword."
 mystic_accord_events.6.a:0 "Free this mote of vengeful Hokuma."
 mystic_accord_events.6.b:0 "Turn away from the energy, it is too fierce."
 mystic_accord_events.7.t:0 "Into the Dark River"
 mystic_accord_events.7.d:0 "While on a riverboat sailing down the silt-dark Hukai, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was enchanted by a black swan paddling a gentle course upstream against the river’s fierce current. So taken was the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by the strange swan that, as they made their way to the ship’s rail, they barely noticed the lurch of the waves that sent them off the boats side and into the dark, hungry waters of the Hukai."
 mystic_accord_events.7.a:0 "Reach a hand towards the Black Swan Hukai."
 mystic_accord_events.7.b:0 "Exhale and kick and rise."
 mystic_accord_events.8.t:0 "By the Waters of Telebei I Sat Down and Wept"
 mystic_accord_events.8.d:0 "Sitting upon the banks of the gentle Telebei in contemplation, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was all at once overcome by a deep and resonant emotion, somewhere between joy and mourning. Tears began to stream down their face, the taste sweet upon parched lips, like the waters of the river itself. Through blurred eyes they looked out over the wide water where a furrow was being wrought upon its surface by a slowly approaching turtle. Reaching the banks it scooped itself from the river and onto the sandy bank, staring with golden eyes at our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mystic_accord_events.8.a:0 "Oh Gentle Telebei, wash the tears from my cheeks."
 mystic_accord_events.8.b:0 "We have no need for weak spirits! Begone!"
 mystic_accord_events.9.t:0 "Which I am Forbidden to See"
 mystic_accord_events.9.d:0 "While on a hunt in the hills of Xianje, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] became separated from their party. Before they could turn to catch up with the rest of the procession, a thick, impenetrable fog had risen from the damp earth. Then, in the mist, figures began to twist and dance, ephemeral as light on steam. One, standing still amongst the moving shapes, beckoned for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One of the hunters, perhaps? No, its form wasn’t quite human. Yet still it seemed to draw the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] towards it."
 mystic_accord_events.9.a:0 "Follow Hengdu Bowu into the deep mists."
 mystic_accord_events.9.b:0 "Sound the horn! Summon the rest of the hunt."
 mystic_accord_events.10.t:0 "Pressing Lidless Eyes"
 mystic_accord_events.10.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] climbed the thousand thousand steps of Tughayasa to visit with the seers atop the great mountain. The climb, normally filled with jostling pilgrims, was empty, silent except for the echoing steps of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The temple at the peak too was bare, the sages nowhere to be found, the normally constant ringing of bells quiet. [Root.Monarch.GetName] made their name into the great hall where the oracular masters receive visitors, and, seeing it was bare, turned away. Before they could leave, an odd noise, like the tearing of paper, split the air behind them. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] turned to see a smattering of eyes floating like paper talismans in the still air of the chamber. They blinked with that same sound of shredded parchment."
 mystic_accord_events.10.a:0 "Tughayasa will see me. All of me."
 mystic_accord_events.10.b:0 "Flee from their burning gaze!"
 mystic_accord_events.11.t:0 "The First Warlord of Haless"
 mystic_accord_events.11.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] awoke to a familiar, yet entirely unknown sight. A throne room that was not their own. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rose from the position they came to in - a kowtow - and stood up, examining their surroundings. A voice boomed from the empty throne, each word bringing the visage of a dragon further into view. Yanhe, his draconic figure so large that only his head rested upon the throne, spoke slow, deliberate words.\n\n"I recognize your desires and deem them acceptable. I offer you my patronage, if only you will accept it.""
 mystic_accord_events.11.a:0 "I shall accept your power, mighty dragon spirit!"
 mystic_accord_events.11.b:0 "It is not necessary, great warlord..."
 mystic_accord_events.12.t:0 "A Secret Admirer"
 mystic_accord_events.12.d:0 "The last few days had been quite frustrating for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Accosted by an unknown individual, they had woken up every day to a bouquet of flowers addressed to them, but by an unknown sender. Even worse, no matter how much [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked, they simply could not figure out who the sender was! Today, though, that changed - while interrogating a servant for answers, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was greeted by that famous grin and witnessed the servant pull their nose out into an elephant's trunk. It was Dhenbasana!"
 mystic_accord_events.12.a:0 "Great spirit, we have much to discuss!"
 mystic_accord_events.12.b:0 "Get out. Get out!"
 mystic_accord_events.13.t:0 "As the River Flows"
 mystic_accord_events.13.d:0 "Kharunyana did move around on occasion, but it is incredibly easy to track such a large fish. Especially so when it endeavored to make itself known.\n\nVisiting the great spirit-fish at least once was something of an informal obligation for [Root.Monarch.GetName] and neglecting to do so would be a terrible blow to their piety. There was something humbling about Kharunyana's gaze, even as the spirit offered [Root.Monarch.GetName] supper for their toils. If there was something to ask, now would be the time..."
 mystic_accord_events.13.a:0 "Kharunyana! I seek your answers to my questions."
 mystic_accord_events.13.b:0 "I will be going now, spirit. Good day."
 mystic_accord_events.14.t:0 "The Eye of the Desert"
 mystic_accord_events.14.d:0 "To even see Marutha in person is a tall ask, for the journey is by design precarious - only those who really, truly care to do so would even attempt to risk their lives in such a way. The effort of [Root.Monarch.GetName] seems to have been recognized by Marutha - for they are able to step through the sandstorm, past sunscorched skeletons and stand before the great lion, the spirit observing back with a dispassionate expression. Finally the philosopher king asks with a deep, booming voice from beyond his veil of sand.\n\n"What is it you desire, [Root.Monarch.GetName]?""
 mystic_accord_events.14.a:0 "I seek your patronage, mighty spirit!"
 mystic_accord_events.14.b:0 "To be a wise and just ruler until the end of my days."
 mystic_accord_events.15.t:0 "Late Night Visitor"
 mystic_accord_events.15.d:0 "It was long after the sun had set. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was going to bed, only to shoot up when their back made contact with warm fur. They witnessed the fox tail they had just laid on flick out of the bed, returning behind the figure of a Huli-Jing. Quickly, [Root.Monarch.GetName] wraps themselves in blankets, seeking not to look improper. The spirit speaks to them, tails flowing like water.\n\n"I speak for Huszien, do you wish for her boon, little [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? I will provide it, if you can keep me... engaged.""
 mystic_accord_events.15.a:0 "Let's talk terms, before sleep takes me."
 mystic_accord_events.15.b:0 "I seek to sleep."
