 fangaulan_pantheon.1.t:0 "A Worthy Patron"
 fangaulan_pantheon.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked out across [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] new realm, thinking about how far [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has come, and who [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] owed that achievement to. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] friends and family were a great help, of course, but there was one above them all who had protected [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] since [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] adolescence. [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked over and knelt down in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal shrine, holding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand crafted Gris Gris charm first close against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, then up to the shrine itself. The charm glowed warmly in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] whispered a prayer of thanks to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] divine patron…"
 fangaulan_pantheon.1.a:0 "I thank thee"
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.t:0 "Returning to God"
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.d:0 "It is a sad, sad day. Our previous leader has left their life with us behind, and has moved on to the moon, to be with God in the afterlife. Though it is undoubtedly a tragic occasion, we do have the opportunity to honor their legacy by dedicating an extravagant funeral in their name in Gamyi, according to the rites of the Kanhati priesthood.\n\nLed by a seasoned Kanhati priest, a grand procession, attended by tens of thousands, would be set up at the base of the ancient spire situated there. Dressed in a black robe and donning a red-ruby horned mask in honor of the god of death, the Kanhati priest would oversee the building of a massive funeral pyre – after it is completed, the Kanhati priest will go through all of the proper funeral rites, leading the audience in mourning. Then the funeral casket is cast into the fire, and as the body is consumed by the flames, those gathered remember and reflect on our late ruler’s life, as the memories accompany their spirit to the moon.\n\nIt would be very expensive, especially due to the large amount of wood required, but it would give us time to reflect and mourn, and it would certainly cast us in a positive light. Sometimes, however, money can be worth more than respect."
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.a:0 "Send them off to Kanhati"
 fangaulan_pantheon.2.b:0 "A local funeral will do"
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.t:0 "A Cry for Heir"
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.d:0 "With our ruler advancing in years, and the succession frighteningly insecure, our court’s priestess of Ujun has proposed holding a ritual sacrifice to the Ujun sisters for a fertility blessing. The ritual reenacts the story of the Beautiful Mother’s sacrifice for the tribe's children.\n\nDuring the rites, actors would play out the story of how the Beautiful Mother allowed herself to be eaten by a monstrous Kadda while wearing a dress made out of poisonous plants, sacrificing herself but killing the beast in the process. Of course, we cannot sacrifice our actor, so in the place of the Beautiful Mother we will need to perform a massive cattle sacrifice, which would devastate our cow herds for years. Nonetheless, completing the ritual should ensure an heir and secure the line of succession, even if it is at the cost of productivity."
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.a:0 "Round up the Livestocks!"
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.b:0 "We can’t afford it"
 fangaulan_pantheon.3.c:0 "I’ll make one myself!"
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.t:0 "Divine Wrath"
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.d:0 "The river that flows from Makan down to Zittar has suddenly flooded, causing destruction and displacing many. The peasants living by the river are proclaiming this is a sign of the goddess Makan’s anger, and have proposed we perform a ritual to calm her. This ritual, the Tabo Adau, includes transporting slaves to the riverbank and liberating them from bondage, as they purify themselves in the water and toss their dirty shackles into the rapids.\n\nIf we were to fulfill their request then this may set a dangerous precedent that could encourage others to seek escape from slavery, showing our nobles that we are willing to give up their slaves – their property – to alleviate the unrest of the masses. It would surely show them that our authority is not as great as it seems, allowing people to question our legitimacy. However, if we did deny their request it could lead to outright revolts and continued tensions for years to come, as the people will see our refusal as a betrayal. "
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.a:0 "Allow the ritual to pass"
 fangaulan_pantheon.4.b:0 "This is only a ploy to breed rebellion, deny them!"
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.t:0 "Pillar of Eternity"
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.d:0 "Recently, a terrible storm was forming above Sigilan, one that threatened the livelihoods of many. Our priests were preparing to sacrifice a large part of the grain stores, hoping to appease any aspects of God that would listen, when a massive bolt of lightning hit the Pillar of Aro! \n\nHowever, instead of damaging the pillar, the lightning washed over the pillar in a shower of sparks, dissipating as it reached the ground. For perhaps ten minutes afterwards, the pillar glowed a brilliant blue, as it lit up the stormy sky. The storm that promised to cause devastation receded, calming down like it was being sung to sleep by the pillar, like a mother would sing to her baby.\n\nThis is clearly a gift from the gods – all that is left for us is to decide how to interpret this sign of favor."
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.a:0 "A sign for peace and prosperity"
 fangaulan_pantheon.5.b:0 "A testament of Aro’s craft!"
