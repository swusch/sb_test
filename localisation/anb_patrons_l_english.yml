The few mythological accounts of a Xhazob describe a huge quadrupedal monster exhibiting a chaotic mixture of predatory features, wreathed in green flames and emanating a palpable aura of dread.\n\nXhazobs are largely uninterested in the affairs of mortals, but instead like sharks to the scent of blood are drawn through the outer planes to mass slaughter and suffering. This is invariably how contact is initially made with a Xhazob, and once a pact is struck they will demand ever greater violence from their erstwhile host, feasting on the souls of those slain in their name before they will deign to join with the supplicant and create a new [Root.xhaz_gender_tt]."

The roaring of the great fire seems to change, more guttural and animalistic somehow,as though alive. An indistinct shape moves and twists in the flickering blaze and the gathered host of gnolls begins to feel the presence of the beast. Hackles rise and uneasy cackling issues from the assembled horde as a claw of emerald fire reaches out to touch [Root.Monarch.GetName] on their brow. They bare their teeth as a twisted mark is singed into their flesh. The pyre flares once more before being snuffed out, as suddenly as though a great wind had passed through.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turns to the assembled horde, the mark on their brow blazing with a profane light. Their roar of triumph is echoed across the camp as the horde breaks into exultant celebration. The Xhazob has tasted the initial offering and is most pleased!"

Always there, always watching.\n\nA fox sits regally on top of a table, hours into this madness, looking directly at you; at your soul.

Alarmed at first, as most would be at the sight of a wild fox in their home, [Root.Monarch.GetName] quickly came to realize it was a Huli Jing! Not just any though, but the very same they made the pact with several moons ago. The mischievous being jumped up, transforming from the small fox into a beautiful woman with multiple bushy tails, but all were maintained meticulously and kept in a beautiful order. Stepping closer to [Root.Monarch.GetName], the woman smiles softly and chuckles, stepping closer to them to be face to face. "My my? You certainly are working late aren't you? You wouldn't want to stumble upon any late night mischievous Huli Jing making a ruckus, would you?" She giggles playfully, ignoring the irony of her statement, while reaching to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s cheek and strokes it lightly. "I come bearing gifts for my ward. Oh, but, choose carefully. You may have just one." She says, stepping backwards and one of her tails swishes you in the face, after turning around and grinning at you."
