 banche_albatross_title:0 "Banche Albatross"
 banche_albatross_desc:0 "“First friend, sea-roamer, loyal. Noble bearing, golden beak, white-gold neck.”\n\nWe have always fished off the western coast of Amadia, hunting by birdspeech and by sea-net. That we have failed to mimic the trade voyages of the Anqunu, the blue people who occasionally make landfall on our shores, is a question not of ability but of organisation. Until recently, we Banche lived only as clans, and the nature of the family is to eschew the boundless risk of the unknown frontier, protecting its chilldren. Now the clans act as one, and the seafarer visage Prayú offers pathways to the brave across the grand plain of the ocean. Our avian friends do not fear that endless place - why should we?"

 rigoti_meadowlark_title:0 "Rigoti Meadowlark"
 rigoti_meadowlark_desc:0 "“Hides among the Alecandi grasses. Red-throat, foolhardy, responds well to dares.”\n\nOur codexes record a long history of occasional trade visits by the Anqunu, the blue people of the south. There was a time when each occasional visit of a Kheionai ship would spawn a qhatuwái for at least a season or two, so great was their hunger for the silver and magical ores of Amadia. As we have begun to take to the sea in earnest, however, we have learned to evade the deadly squalls of the Kaydhano with the aid of our birds, mapping their island of Alecand for ourselves. In their willingness to trade, the Anqunu have proven themselves reasonable - but even reasonable men harbour ambitions all their own.\n\nPlacing their trust in the static, unyielding city, they themselves have become static and unyielding. We hear stories of their profound ambition and desire, the span of their holdings. Such people must be approached with caution. We will support those who will have us, cultivate the weak, and grow on their northern horizon until our web of trade is a fact of life, inexorable and unchallengeable."

 grey_gull_title:0 "Grey Gull"
 grey_gull_desc:0 "“Grey-white, apparently indifferent to the Kaydhano. Haughty.”\n\nWe have come to know the true meaning of pride when dealing with the Kheionai, for the city-builders of Alecand are uncertain how to deal with us. Neither belligerent Taychendi feudatories nor holy aesthetes, we Banche offer the irrepressible logic of exchange, and these scholars, possessed of their own ancient history, bristle at the thought. We will endeavour to add them to our network nonetheless, for they possess skills and techniques we envy, and we are not bound by their prejudices.\n\nAs more and more Kheionai wealth flows into our web of commerce, let us adapt their technology and scholarship to our purposes. In particular, their many-levelled galleys, enormous in size, may well complement the Cannorian deep-sea ship designs which we have acquired from the east."

 tyrant_flycatcher_title:0 "Tyrant Flycatcher"
 tyrant_flycatcher_desc:0 "“White throat fading to yellow belly. Fierce but honest. Guards the shrubland.”\n\nThe swaggering warlords of Taychend are hard to know, hard to love. But they are ruinborn too, and we will not allow the arrogant colonisers to sweep away a culture they barely understand, even if it is unpalatable to us. Besides this, the Taychendi are fierce warriors, and they will accept such subjugation no more willingly than we. \n\nThe Cannorians have proven a willingness to intervene far from home in defence of their rapacious colonies; let us do the same in defence of our world. We rather suspect they won’t know what hit them."

 qachuruy_title:0 "Qáchuruy"
 qachuruy_desc:0 "“Nocturnal, fruit-eating messenger. Large and slim, rich brown spotted with white. Assiduous.”\n\nThus speaks the Payisqu Codex of our messenger bird and fast friend, the qáchuruy. We Banche have spoken to birds since the most ancient days, since two visages - fragments of greater gods - granted us their secrets in the wake of cataclysm. Our lives are built on constant movement and exchange, and in our endless dance across our homeland we have built a network of trade and exploration.\n\nThe serpent must fall, however; change comes for everyone. Our enemies the Chaqanel grow stronger with each passing season, but we are not so foolish as to challenge them in open battle now, to no gain but our pride. We must instead finally step beyond the world of the greater family and form a people, passing on the birdspeech through more than mere family ties. At the same time, we must find whatever friends exist at the end of the Qáchuruy’s flightpath, and bind them to us in marriage and profit."

 yesbali_sandpiper_title:0 "Yesbali Sandpiper"
 yesbali_sandpiper_desc:0 "“Light-brown, jovial, sand camouflage. Migrates across Tor Nayyi.”\n\nTraders have ever plied their wares across the straits to our north. The gods have laid out a path of islands between ourselves and the people of Yesbal, and though grand expeditions were never our way, the maps we have assembled in recent years only accord with the old codex records of that place. The Yesbali are still foreigners, though, and we tread carefully in our efforts to expand our network of trade. Let us discreetly bind them to us by commerce and marriage, until our peoples are as one."

 toothpick_plover_title:0 "Toothpick Plover"
 toothpick_plover_desc:0 "“Black and white plumage. Intelligent. Feeds symbiotically from sandworm teeth, cleaning them.”\n\nThis is a time of change, a time when foreign powers come to our homeland. We know from our expeditions to the ends of what the Cannorians call Aelantir that no region of this continent is truly safe from incursion, whether by the human logic of endless expansion or the bizarre entitlement of the reclaimer elves. We know, too, that our brothers to the north are unprepared for what awaits them.\n\nHow the gods will grimace if we but meekly forfeit our lands to these parasites. There are horrors to this continent that these interlopers cannot fathom, unique weapons and allies to be found everywhere. With the talents unique to our birdspeakers and the ingenuity of our homeland, we must learn to beat back the invaders."

 fey_ptarmigan_title:0 "Fey Ptarmigan"
 fey_ptarmigan_desc:0 "“Fat and well-plumed. Eccentric. Answers with unusual clarity.”\n\nThe long arm of Cannor has made shallower gains in Eordand than elsewhere, but even now their merchants hunger for the relics of this ancient place. We cannot allow Cannor to plunder our birthright for their bizarre ends. Even they admit, with their term ‘ruinborn’, that such places are our shared birthright. The people of all seasons must be warned about the influence of Cannor - with Eordand firmly woven into our network, the relics of our ancestors will benefit us, not the outlanders."

 tanaqi_title:0 "Tanaqi"
 tanaqi_desc:0 "“Small higher-canopy percher. A riot of greens, golds and blues. Chatty.”\n\nSince the golden serpent fell, we Banche have traded. We do not measure worth in weapons or even loyalty, for sentient hearts are fickle and the profit of bloodshed fleeting. Instead, we know the world by the flow of commerce, the give and take which, like a finger against a taut sheet, pulls on the fabric around it. \n\nIn some vital places, the energy of exchange collects as does water in a lake. Just as we marshal the visages Humu, Sonquo and Soi, so will we create harmony from this asymmetry. It is time the Banche came together as one, time that the fleeting trading posts of this land became places of divine convergence. We will spread this vital truth - civilisation is nothing more and nothing less than mutually beneficial exchange."

 scarlet_macaw_title:0 "Scarlet Macaw"
 scarlet_macaw_desc:0 "“Rainbow bird, red-dominant, nervous but amiable. Mates for life.”\n\nAny Amadian, and even the odd traveller from strange lands afar, will tell you that the Banche are the people of the marriage fairs. Every five years, a great sea of macaw-feather wedding cloaks descend upon whichever qhatuwái has been chosen, adorning a thousand eager shoulders. For months at a time, a new trading place briefly becomes the capital of our people, a place to lash beasts of burden and to make one’s fortune. \n\nA curious thing, however: each time, when the traders leave and the newlyweds cast off to make their own caravan, a few stay behind. The more we circle Amadia, the more such settlements flourish, and the greater the wealth that circulates between our qhatuwái. Soon all Amadia will be bound together in prosperity and matrimony, our friends so numerous that none may threaten our peace."

 peregrine_falcon_title:0 "Peregrine Falcon"
 peregrine_falcon_desc:0 "“Shoulder-percher, stern. Flies beyond the end of the world, but nests with us.”\n\nThere is a change in the wind, or so our birds tell it. Strangers arrive on islands which were once untouched; old nesting places must be moved along the cliffs; strange blowguns fire smithy-scraps at the flocks. The visitor birds whom we gauge for news are often hard to interpret, but this much is clear - our world is huge, and in our endless peripatetic wanderings, we have seen so little of it.\n\nClans ache to mimic the peregrine ambition of the brave sea falcon - they wish to go to the end of the land in every direction, perhaps to glimpse the other world from which these new people come. The falcons, on the other hand? They begin to speak of revenge."

 alunguin_hummingbird_title:0 "Álunguin Hummingbird"
 alunguin_hummingbird_desc:0 "“Jeweled greens, long white tail. Convivial. Flitters from flower to flower.”\n\nAs we have mapped Aelantir and beyond, we have seen a hundred flourishing ways to live. The grand cities of the Kheionai, the warlike polities of Taychend, the council structures of the Boek, the seasonal templars of Eordand; all offer their own vibrant models of life and trade.\n\nAs change wracks this continent and all these multifarious ways of life come under threat, we must organise. The qhatuwái is our gift to statecraft, the central organising principle of our cities and lives. Our network now expands far beyond Amadia; we do not shrink from the greater qhatuwái, but embrace it."

 huyaqsi_title:0 "Huyaqsí"
 huyaqsi_desc:0 "“Distinct reddish-orange crown; king of the jungle birds. Unique to Aelantir.”\n\nThe lesson the Cannorians have taught is to recognise the inimical. Whether they be humans or false-brother elves, the tidal wave of settlers and invaders from across the ocean has shown scant regard for our lives or cultures, has bulldozed all in its wake in the name of a fundamentally unequal exchange. Only the orcs, similarly displaced and kept under brutal slavery, break this pattern of Cannorian arrogance.\n\nWe are born of ruins, so they say, more significant for what preceded us than for our living, vital cultures. Well, so be it. Cannor’s blithe concatenation of a hundred societies was a dreadful mistake, as they will soon learn. In every port of the Banche network, it is left to us to make the obvious argument: resist! We still outnumber them!"

 blueeared_yanfisher_title:0 "Blue-Eyed Yanfisher"
 blueeared_yanfisher_desc:0 "“Cousin to our Uyasqu. Responds immediately, but cautiously. A motif of Yan art.”\n\nLike the Cannorians we have gone west - unlike the Cannorians, we have gone in the name of exchange. A vast oceanic network of trade, a web between equals, now holds all of Western Aelantir in its protective grip. Each port in which our traders stop is a star in this constellation of prosperity. \n\nThe foreigners we have met across the western sea provide a new model of how humans may behave, while their goods, exquisitely beautiful, make their way across the largest ocean on Halann to be eagerly displayed in our qhatuwái. We may still look east with grief to the terror that Cannor has wrought, but we do so as a power they must soon come to fear."

 chakantu_cormorant_title:0 "Chakantu Cormorant"
 chakantu_cormorant_desc:0 "“Fisher bird, easy-going in speech. Handsome browns and whites.”\n\nLong have we brought the rare things of the world to the cosmopolitan lake folk, whose great cities are as heavy and stolid as they are. For all their genuine talent for agriculture and architecture, the lake people are fractious, disunited and fond of conflict.\n\nLet us be the moss which grows over the great stone blocks, binding them together; in the end, they will thank us for the peace we bring. Beyond the obvious benefits of a placid eastern flank, the birds of the lake hold great promise in themselves, and our speakers itch to make their acquaintance."

 wandering_tern_title:0 "Wandering Tern"
 wandering_tern_desc:0 "“Black-capped, distinctive red beak, cruel. Hears, but will not answer.”\n\nWe welcomed these strange newcomers from the east, of course, as we welcome any who acknowledge the value of exchange. They are an alien people with alien values, further flung than even our ancient enemies the Chaqanel, yet they are as deaf to their birds as any other foreigner, and they may yet prove valuable. The test of any people is their ability to give and take; we will hold these folk to no other standard. Perhaps they may yet join the grand network of the qhatuwái."

 horned_screamer_title:0 "Horned Screamer"
 horned_screamer_desc:0 "“Single spur projecting from head. Begrudging. The deafening call carries.”\n\nLooking upon the smiling faces of our merchants, the Cannorians have misunderstood us entirely. They believe they can run roughshod over our traditions, make a deceitful mockery of even trade, and humiliate us without response. They will soon learn that we Banche told the truth; we are the people of exchange, and we will repay them in their own currency.\n\nOnce we drove the hated Chaqanel across the threshold of Amadia and into the alien world of the mushroom forest. For the Cannorians of ‘Vanburia’ is left only the drowning surf."

 amadian_toucan_title:0 "Amadian Toucan"
 amadian_toucan_desc:0 "“Boisterous; the first on land to answer. Adorns our standard.”\n\nThe codexes speak of a time when crossings of Tor Nayyi were considered dangerous things; when our boats would dart from cove to cove, avoiding the wrath of Warachiq. No longer. Now the Banche trade ships move from qhatuwái to qhatuwái, guided along the calmest routes by the skill and flair of the birdspeakers. \n\nOurs is not an Empire draining the life of its periphery to sustain a Cannorian core, but a network of exchange which benefits each of its constituent markets. We have proven not merely that exchange is the basis of society, but that fair exchange can be the basis of immense achievements."

 hearthash_harrier_title:0 "Hearth-Ash Harrier"
 hearthash_harrier_desc:0 "“Vibrant aerial courtship displays. Bird of prey. Grim and ashen as death.”\n\nHow easy it is to tear the cloth; how much harder to weave it together. We perceive society as a network, because like the interlaced net of the coastal fisherman, it is a weaving of many strands, points and ties in a greater whole.\n\nThe Chaqanel have never understood this. They have always placed themselves even beyond the basic societal logic of give and take. For hundreds of years we sought to bind them to our networks, only to see our goodwill repaid in blood - no longer. This grand family of traders we are building can brook no such termites as these; let us harry them beyond the borders of the wandering lands altogether and into the terrifying gloom of the mushroom forest. Such a bleak place is better suited for the violent logic of the brute."

 huythuyt_title:0 "Húyt-Húyt"
 huythuyt_desc:0 "“Red until spored, then a strange blue. Gregarious. Flightless after full fungal growth.”\n\nStories of the alien and terrifying landscape of the mushroom forest have been a part of our folklore for as long as we can remember. It is unique in the world, as far as we can tell; even the farthest-flung sailors recall nothing at all like it. \n\nTo our surprise, the Chaqanel we once ejected into this alien place have learned to thrive, and their dependence on our network for goods unattainable among the fungus has matured their understanding of the nature of exchange. For our purposes, the most exciting news is that the birds there answer back just as readily as our own. What strange new opportunities may lie in the birdspeech of such a place?"

 kaydhano_condor_title:0 "Kaydhano Condor"
 kaydhano_condor_desc:0 "“Huge wingspan, black and white plumage. Shy but affectionate; conquered the death wind.”\n\nFor as long as we Banche have wandered, only a few among us have taken up the challenge of bespeaking the Kaydhano Condor. One of the largest birds in Amadia, if not the world, the Kaydhano Condor has adapted to the furious wild magic of Amadia’s southwest. \n\nThese condors were historically impractical for single clans to feed and maintain, a status symbol rather than a practical part of Banche birdlore. Now, though? Now the network is vast and rich, and the aviaries of the qhatuwái have grown large enough to accommodate such grand birds’ needs."

 cocaire_flamingo_title:0 "Cócaire Flamingo"
 cocaire_flamingo_desc:0 "“Pink with black adornments. Plays favourites. Will defend its speaker to the death.”\n\nFew would have dared to suggest bespeaking the flamingos of Cócaire when first we spread our network to this place. Ornery and fanatically loyal, the flamingos are difficult to keep among a clan, for they crave the exclusive attention of their speaker and will warm to no others. Now, though, we possess the organisation and the community of aviarists needed to make such an endeavour work.\n\nThe potential is enormous - flocks of some of the most powerful birds on Halann, capable of terrifying charges in our name. We who have never excelled at combat on land could make great use of such steadfast friends."

Our trader-gentarchs lead their clans from place to place, bringing goods and ideas. We are agents in the grand shift of energy in this world. Uma’s visages have granted us the means to see such webs of power, to see where the energy of commerce coalesces and pools.\n\nThese are Uma’s Fulcra, the levering points of the world. At our most recent marriage fair in Baní, the birdspeakers and the clan gentarchs came to rare agreement; it is time we worked as one, for the treacherous Chaqanel grow ever bolder in their raids, the sophisticated peoples of the lake ever more organised and ambitious. \n\nWe are not a violent people, and we do not intend to conquer, exactly. Instead, we will grow as a moss, bringing new places and new nodes into our grand networks of trade, defending the basic civilised practice of equivalent exchange. Resisting those who would place childish acquisitiveness above true and equal barter, we must become not merely a collection of clans united by heritage, but a whole and coherent people.\n\nThe fulcra, the great trading places of Amadia - these are the places where we will build our permanent qhatuwái. A qhatuwái is literally a roping-place, named for where we tie our beasts of burden, a sacred place of exchange and ultimately the heart of society. Yet when we move on, the qhatuwái is dismantled. No longer. Soon our network will pulse with life, and all thinking folk will see the benefits of its thrumming pulse."

We have never maintained a capital in the sense employed by the lake folk, a great piling of stones - but Baní is a place of significance, the place we visit to make decisions which affect all the clans at once.\n\nWhere else, then, to create the first permanent qhatuwái? All cloth must begin from one corner, and from the Banche cape we look out onto an Amadia prime for the weaving. What we make of our homeland will be a tough and vital fabric, not easily torn asunder. As we pound the earth flat and leave behind a few families of each clan, a promise is made."
 chaqway.2.d2:0 "Where the great Banchas and its source the Wídnaq meet, a triangle of land forms a confluence island. Trader clans who make the Lake Chakantu loop then dart west to end their cycle here, passing their gifts to clans who then disperse into the rainforest and the plain. Protected on all sides by water, this place seldom goes long without the ground being pounded flat for a qhatuwái; it is time we made it permanent."
 chaqway.2.d3:0 "We have cleared a space. We have peppered the square with stones, as the people of the lakes do, that it may be more easily swept, surer in times of rain. This is a place where the flow of exchange pools for a moment, and we may drink our fill. A few clans have volunteered to leave half their number behind; the broken halves reform as a new clan of this place. By such means is the Banche trade network expanded and strengthened."

This commanding spot over the surrounding plains will offer safety, not threat, and the knowledge that each vast horizon is peaceful. The hateful energy of the Chaqanel will begin to dissipate here, gradually displaced by the flow of rightful exchange. "

 chaqway.9.t:0 "Cormorant Fisheries"
 chaqway.9.d:0 "Larraq smoothed down his tunic as he approached the dock. He had threaded two strings at the side of his head, braided his hair around each and tied them at the back. He’d checked with mama - it wasn’t too much, wasn’t too affected. He was bare-legged to above the knee, of course, since fashion sometimes had to yield to practicality, but he fancied he looked confident enough wading through the mud to her little boat, hopping up to perch on the side of the shallow hull.\n\nAnqasmúy was speaking to her cormorants again. She had bound her long braid so that it would not drag in the bilge when she sat to row, but Larraq knew with absolute recall that when loose, it would brush almost to her knees - it would outline her. He did not interrupt the birdspeech. He knew, because he had asked, that Anq divided this part of the lake into four broad quadrants. She did not have to tell her cormorants which quadrants were theirs - they were habitual, territorial things. What she was doing now was more like scolding, brushing their gentle necks and asking them not to bother each other.\n\nWhen Anqasmúy was finished, she released the cormorants; they fluttered out, dispersing across the sun-drenched water. She turned to him, careful and sardonic in her way.\n\n“C’mon, fisher boy.” Anq indicated a little to the west. “Sweetie is the most conscientious. Let’s get her haul first.” Larraq nodded, trying to hide his smile. A whole day lay ahead on this little boat."

 chaqway.10.d:0 "“Do not recoil, girl.” the Aviarist’s voice is brisk, her gaze impatient.\n\nGaléwey glances up, swallowing. “Sorry, mistress.” She tells her brain what she is about to see. She looks again.\n\nOne wing has twisted painfully open, far beyond normal, so that the weight of the fungal growth now rests on the little bird’s rump. The other is permanently pinned to the húyt-húyt’s side, fringed in that odd, mould-like blue - permanently stuck to the húyt-húyt’s body. The equivalent in a human would be the worst of tortures, and Galéwey finds herself in tears. But she does not look away.\n\nThe Aviarist nods. “Now speak.”\n\nGaléwey gathers her hair over one shoulder, a nervous habit. She doesn’t know how to begin, where to start. She has heard the húyt-húyt call, of course; it was part of the first months here at the aviary, when they all began by learning to truly listen. She excels at everything except the listening - she is a fine mage, but a terrible Banche. Months at this academy, and she has not once heard unqualified praise. She is but eleven, and yet she knows she is expected to guide the húyt-húyt in their fungal growth, control it. It is a miracle substance for poisons and medicines both, synthesised in the sprawling laboratories of the aviary.\n\nShe knows, suddenly, what to say. “How is your pain?” she asks, in the low, fluting call.\n\n“Number than yours,” the húyt-húyt replies."

 chaqway.11.t:0 "Albatross Navigators"
 chaqway.11.d:0 "“Eh, Quna?” called the boatswain, as Qunchúy climbed smoothly onto the forecastle. These sailors always called him so - Quna - for he was shorter than most women, and slight at that. They felt protective of him as they did of their own sons, though he was older than a few of them… it had just about stopped making him wince. He sat right at the lip of the deck. The unfamiliar observer might gasp, for he seemed at risk of being blown off the forecastle entirely, tipped off by the slightest wind.\n\nYet he feared nothing, for no birdspeaker of the Banche was merely a birdspeaker. Qunchúy felt the wind fill him with each breath, knew that should he fall, the ocean would rise to cradle him. Each morning he woke thankful that he had his magic, that he was a prodigy at his art rather than a failure of a deckhand. He could perceive the wind for miles across, but he was nothing compared to his Alacheq.\n\nHe felt Alacheq coursing towards the ship at his silent, birdspoken tug. They did not speak as commander and soldier, as some birdspeakers chose. It was more like inviting a friend to play. The ship was almost precisely halfway across Tor Nayyi, but the further south they got, the choppier the sea could become. Qunchúy felt the thrill of Alacheq’s descent, the glory of the dive.\n\nAnd then he felt Alacheq’s wings, grand and massive, envelop him. One of the sailors cursed, for Alacheq had plummeted so suddenly. Qunchúy grinned, feeling Alacheq’s great beak rest on his shoulder. He was among those birdspeakers who did not even need to vocalise to reach his companions. \n\n“Adjust sunward,” Qunchúy called out, eventually, addressing the navigators. “About thirty. There’s a squall.”"

The kindest clan-gentarch anyone knows, dissolving into outright rage.\n\n“They are like the Chaqanel,” Tanáwey says sharply, and though a granny in the back huffs at that, nobody contradicts her. “Marriage is something they steal.” Someone is arriving in the qhatuwái hostel, confused - a young girl murmurs to her of ‘second families back in Cannor’, of deceit, of bigamy. Of unequal exchange.\n\n“We must get the young ones first, before we do anything.” Séwi’s voice, to a chorus of approval. “Then… then there is no forgiveness for this. To sit in the marriage tent, among the people, and lie…”\n\n“It is like their trading,” Llaqaru says, slowly, as if trying to grind a stone with his teeth. “They do not respect old route-rights, they are always trying to cheat. In marriage, too. They do not understand exchange.” He puts a great, pained emphasis on this last word, and there is nodding, grim faces. Everyone here is tired of it. Everyone here has seen the way the Cannorians do things.\n\n“Like the Chaqanel!” Tanáwey repeats, and this time there is a murmur of agreement. “We did not let the Chaqanel make concubines of us. We are a faithful people. We do not take slave spouses.”\n\n“We do not,” said Llaqaru, deep and grave. “And we punish those who do.”"

You saw?”\n\nQeldena nodded slowly, offering the little plover a stroke and her lazy smile. She heard poorly these days, and the plover had noticed; already the young fellow had learned to hop on her left shoulder, never her right, when he had something to brag to her about. \n\nShe felt an urge, from somewhere distant and long before her military career, to beg him to be careful. But the plover had already alighted from her shoulder and shot straight into a great mass of tubes and tunnels which dominated the opposing wall of the aviary. It was a kind of training, though truth be told, the cannonwork these little plovers did was far less complex than the training system. The cannonwork was simply a dive into the barrel to dry or clean or, with the smaller bores, to replace shot. This was simply for fun.\n\nThe plovers were easily bored, you see. They fed from the teeth of the great sandworms of Haraf, and were used to thrill, to danger. So much of the plover’s life was to anticipate the surge of the sandworm back into the sand, to fly free with good timing. It was in realising this that Qeldena had understood how to make them obey.\n\nYou had to tell them the cannon could kill them."

The Cannorians could not truly run from our birds, who spied them from above and whispered their locations into our birdspeakers’ ears. Two places we have renamed; one for our terrible vengeance, the other for our forgiveness.\n\nAt Qúynuralaqí - ‘Sorrow of the Cannorians’ - we drove the last of the so-called Vanburians into the shallow surf and dared them to swim home. Then we set the gulls upon them, staining the salt tide red. Such a response is extreme only for the complacent: those who do not recognise the terrible warning posed by a people who disrespect the principle of fair exchange.\n\nYet for the societal person, one who recognises the fundamental importance of equal trade, we extend an open hand. Here in Llaqtachasqa, the City of Envoys, we clear the ground for a new kind of qhatuwái.

 chaqway.16.d:0 "Exhaustion. Pain. A ringing that would not leave Boryén’s head, even as he staggered clumsily over another knot of soil and rock in this endless slope. He had to reach the top, had to see. He could’ve commanded Uláq forward, of course, could have already let her loose to do her work. Boryén told himself he didn’t want the targets confused. But he had to see.\n\nUláq was fussing, concerned; she kept landing and taking off again in anxious misery. She knew she was heavy enough to unbalance him, so she kept her slight distance, clicking her concern. It was almost a relief to her, Boryén could feel, when he finally got properly to his feet on the ridge, saw the plunging valley stretch far and clean away, the gaggle of raiders trying to use the stream to hide their steps.\n\n“Those ones,” Boryen said, bringing his hand from his head, only to find it sticky with blood. “Dive, Uláq.”\n\nShe dove. Her mere presence, breaking the air, carried with it the wild magic of Amadia. Boryén could see the flickering of the light around Uláq’s diving form, heard an unnatural crack, like the wind itself was breaking apart. Uláq’s screech filled the valley, and she tore at the face of the leader as she closed in. Her dive ignited the grasses; her claw petrified the flesh it touched. \n\nThere was screaming, of course, and the low, keening groans of the earth-touched man. The group fled back across the water, but the fire was leaping wildly, eating water as gleefully as sedge. By the time Uláq wheeled around for her second dive, she had a choice of dispersing targets. She chose the woman with the basket, and this time dove as ice."

 chaqway.17.d:0 "“Ruinborn: not a term devised by the Amadians, or indeed any Aelantiri. The term itself is redolent with elven arrogance, caustic nostalgia for a past which these delusional foreigners claim as theirs by right. For these plunderers, we are merely squatters, and they the proper inheritors of the ancient secrets of our continent. That the humans have wholesale adopted this framework is a testament to their flimsy weathervane morality.\n\n“Yet in lumping us together as one, the Cannorians have made a deadly mistake. Whether they seek to build their twisted dystopias on the backs of our peoples or simply to strip mine the continent and cart its riches home, they have declared war upon all of us at once, unheeding of our collective potential. Reality demands that we ruinborn recognise this, and act accordingly. The orcish slaves they have dragged to this continent, in a practice more barbaric than the very worst of even Taychendi slavery, are yet another mistake, a weapon they have thoughtlessly cast aside - for the orcs thirst as eagerly as we for a final redress against the evils of Cannor.\n\n“We have collected for you the annals of eight-and-fifty Aelantiri cultures, and laid alongside them two traditions of the displaced orcs. Learn now of your family, reader, and discover what it is we must defend.”\n\n- Enqal Qinqansuray, Born Among Ruins, Prologue."

 chaqway.18.d:0 "Rión’s boots pounded the ground, his armour so heavy that he huffed a breath with almost every pace. This scant time to run had been bought with the lives of his shipmates, even now screaming out from a tide as pink with blood as the birds themselves. He didn’t know where to go. This island was a mere speck in the ocean, a little table poking out from the water. They’d been forced to land right on the harbour if they wanted any chance of taking the place, but as the captain had said, it was barely a township anyway.\n\nHis fucking luck, that one of their birdspeakers should be here. The same chain of luck that had lost him his inheritance, his future, until all that was left to him was a junior naval command in the arsecrack of the world. He stopped suddenly at a clearing, his armour clunking and thudding, but he dared not take it off with those things around. Decide. Choose a direction. He forced himself onward, past the exhaustion and the fear, aiming to loop around, maybe steal a boat and get out to sea. Three steps, three steps more. He was just starting to fancy his chances when the treeline to his right exploded.\n\nEvery Banche schoolchild learns this fact, shares it in awe with family members: the serrated bill of a Cócaire flamingo can tear through steel plate. Chuki had learned it. When she had first bespoken her flock, they were almost unmanageable, like the gaggles of toddlers she’d helped babysit back at the aviary. You had to make your authority known, of course - the key was a firm voice with a little warmth, so they knew you would care for them. Bespeak the flock for long enough and you could communicate from an acre away.\n\nChuki idly reached over for another piece of candied lucuma. A warm glow of appreciation reached Chuki from her babies, and she smiled. They’d been so cooped up on this island, and they were grateful for something to do."

We hear tell that in some ports far to the east, our sailors are mistaken for these folk, and perhaps that is to be expected, for few ports in this wide world are foreign to the Banche\n\nOur network now spans an entire continent and the largest ocean in the world, and yet it does not drain all which is good to a slavering maw at an imaginary centre. Each woven intersection of our great net is enriched, not simply fed upon. What we have created leans on itself, a vast oceanic gyre of exchange. When we hear of those who toil on behalf of faraway rulers, without the basic rights of the qhatuwái to achieve redress, we know the lie at the heart of Cannor, the pretense at civilisation, the perfume over the rotting canker sore. \n\nAmadia is safe and prosperous, and we can say the same of Western Aelantir - but so much remains of the world to be brought into fair exchange. Thankful to our past, we must nevertheless look with principle upon the future."
