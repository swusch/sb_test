 escanntribal.1.t:0 "Human texts found"
 escanntribal.1.da:0 "While in our time of slavery we had no opportunity to interact with humans, many now seek out the remains of the Castanorians, not just out of opportunism - but curiosity too. One lucky squad of looters recently got their hands on some old tomes and books and brought them back to their town. The shamans, who have already started translating the human language of Common, took it for granted that they would receive the texts as a research aid, but the Naegub, intellectually-inclined and influential traders, have started offering to buy them instead."
 escanntribal.1.db:0 "While we were once disinterested in the weak human cultures, many now seek out the remains of the Castanorians – not just for tools and gold but for scrolls and artifacts too. One lucky squad of looters recently got their hands on some old tomes and books and brought them back to their town. The shamans, who have already started translating the human language of Common, took it for granted that they would receive the texts as a research aid, but some intellectually-inclined traders and generals have started offering to buy them instead."
 escanntribal.1.a:0 "Trust the shamans"
 escanntribal.1.b:0 "Sell them to the highest bidder"
 
 escanntribal.2.t:0 "Builders studying Cannorian constructions"
 escanntribal.2.d:0 "In the caves of the Serpentspine, our permanent settlements were carved in stone, and they could expand up and down. Here, building isn’t as exhausting as carving out entire rooms, but we still haven’t quite adjusted. Struck by the impressive remains of the old Castanorians, a group of builders has been studying them for weeks, hoping to reverse-engineer the techniques that made such buildings possible - and hopefully even improve on them."
 escanntribal.2.a:0 "Fund them"
 escanntribal.2.b:0 "Excellent!"
 escanntribal.2.c:0 "Truly inspiring"
 
 escanntribal.3.t:0 "Squatters no more"
 escanntribal.3.da:0 "Dwarven architecture is imposing, showing off industrial prowess and strength that we goblins have rarely achieved, and dwarven architecture with human proportions is even more intimidating. Through much effort, this city answers to a goblin boss, but it is still made for humans in many aspects: stairs are too big for our children, furniture is too high, and doorknobs are unreachable. An ingenious band of goblins has decided to correct the city’s errors."
 escanntribal.3.db:0 "Back in the Serpentspine, we used to pillage and loot thoroughly any Dwarven hold we managed to conquer. Castonath, the first hold outside of the Serpentspine we occupied, is different however: we are no more here as vandals, but as new residents. The city however doesn’t accommodate fully for the Orcish life, so a group of builders has started renovating their district."
 escanntribal.3.a:0 "Aid the renovators"
 escanntribal.3.b:0 "They don't need our help"
 
 escanntribal.4.t:0 "Surface crops tamed"
 escanntribal.4.d:0 "Back in the Serpentspine, gatherers and farmers would yield Serpentsbloom and mushrooms, but those aren’t adapted to surface soil. Our farmers have learned how to best cultivate the staple crop of Cannor: wheat."
 escanntribal.4.a:0 "Great!"
 
 escanntribal.5.t:0 "Studying Gunpower"
 escanntribal.5.d:0 "The dwarves have long known how to craft firearms, but only when we decided to go out of the Serpentspine did we discover that the humans had adopted this technology too. In recent months, traders, looters, and other ingenious folks have finally brought together enough gunpowder and firearms for us to study them effectively."
