  flavour_kravigozles.0.d:0 "2 years ago our ancestors broke the shackles of the devilish elven trade galleys during a storm, at the hundreds they slaved away on the knife-ears barges their lives seen as expendable by the arrogant creatures. That fateful stormy night their successful revolt seemed almost a mockery as the goblins has little time to laugh at their freedom before dreading their death in unknown waters. Alas when the wrecks of their galleys washed ashore the morning after, they found themselves in an unknown and inhospitable land full of dense jungles that the light would not pierce. Against all odds the Goblins born in Mountains that now seemed a world away traveled until they found a large rock formation and sheltering caves within. Fate would lead this first generation of the Clan not only to Protection from the weather but a deeper discovery: deep within the tunnels a curious Goblin stumbled upon an ancient chamber within wich lied a dried up stone well: Unknown runes on the walls of the chamber sprang to life glowing in strange colours when a typical brawl between goblin cousins spilled a drop of blood into the Well, it seemed like the Caverns themselves drank up the Red Ichor thirstily and a voice spoke to the little creatures, promising survival, prosperity, glory and power, should they feed the spirit more and more. The Self serving and greedy nature, coupled with the same survival instinct that had them live through the turmoils before led to a short and particularly bloody revolt where an eager group of goblins took control of the Clan and the Well, blessed with magical influence over their kin they soon fanatically bled their vanquised brothers and sisters dry for the being whos name echoed within the walls of their minds ever since: §RNroekh§"
