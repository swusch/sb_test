 binsplosion_events.1.t:0 "The End of Authority"
 binsplosion_events.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood outside the ancient palace, wrought from genie-bound golems by great Aro himself. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] overlooked their ‘empire’, though its borders had long receded from the great days of the Second Empire. They had lost the grander, coastal capital of Sigilan to the Gnollish scourge, and the army thought [Root.Monarch.GetName] weak, too craven to show their face on the field. Additionally, disturbing reports of Ogres had spread throughout the realm, though people didn’t know where they were coming from.\n\nRather than suffering a quick, and perhaps preferable death, Binwarji had festered and corroded, a mighty sword turned dull and dusted with the ravages of time, and of weak men on the throne. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked out to the farmlands, and prayed God would deliver them a solution."
 binsplosion_events.1.a:0 "Hope is the best virtue one can have in these trying times."

 binsplosion_events.2.t:0 "Authority Collapsed"
 binsplosion_events.2.d:0 "It was barely to the horizon now. That’s how much [Root.Monarch.GetName] ruled at this point. The horizon. Everything else was ruled by jumped up governors with ambitions above their station, upstart rebellious ingrates, monstrous arrivals from beyond the limits of civilization, or village elders who’ve gotten one too many bad ideas. Fangaula, the empire which up until now had continued to limp along as half theory, half practice, was dead.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wondered what they would do. Perhaps they would be snuffed out, the final flicker of the embers left from the great blaze of their legacy. Or perhaps, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] descendants would grit their teeth, draw their weapons, and forge the empire anew. Either way, they were but lords of the horizon now."
 binsplosion_events.2.a:0 "An Empire at its end…"

 binsplosion_events.3.t:0 "Authority Restored"
 binsplosion_events.3.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watched as the parades continued. These weren’t the ones of triumph, mind you. Those were for later, when the price of defiance had been made clear to all. For now, the parades were ones not of silver and salt, but of slaves, shackled prisoners, their eyes forced low in the shame of their attempted rebellion.\n\nEmperors past knew well: Authority is enforced by blood, preferably the blood of those who attempt to seize it. And that meant that thousands today would be brought before Biakata’s statue, forced to kneel and beg for forgiveness. And where one was granted that forgiveness in the form of a quiet enslavement within the palace, nine more were executed right then and there, to the raucous cheer of the ecstatic masses.\n\nAnd for a time, authority would suffer no great defiance once more."
 binsplosion_events.3.a:0 "An Empire reborn… if we can but keep it."

 binsplosion_events.4.t:0 "Ogre Magic"
 binsplosion_events.4.d:0 "”This missive is to be given to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with the utmost haste, as the report by Ngolo Folforo on the ‘Ogre Problem’.\n\nI have personally sighted them in increasing numbers by the border with Tzilekal, usually busy eating much of the local wildlife along the way, but also I have received accounts from villages saying their cattle and crops are being stolen by them. Additionally, mage binders have noted planetouched moving away from them in large numbers, the reason as of yet unknown.\n\nAnd then there are the rumors of strange magic. I have not personally seen it, but the gathered eyewitness accounts are too similar to ignore. Sandstorms searing our border in odd timings and outside of the dry season? It is no doubt the work of their rituals and rites. Such sorcery is foul and does not bode well for the realm. I understand your hands are tied, great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but I beseech you to send a court mage or planetouched to perhaps reason with or at least investigate their uncanny magics further.”"
 binsplosion_events.4.a:0 "Unfortunate that we have more important matters to deal with."
 binsplosion_events.4.b:0 "No doubt the Gnollish scourge sent them our way!"
 binsplosion_events.4.c:0 "Send our court mage, we cannot delay investigating this matter."

 binsplosion_events.6.t:0 "Planetouched Revolt"
 binsplosion_events.6.d:0 ""It was noon when Diata finally found her way back to the village of her birth, which rested on a small rise overlooking the surrounding savanna. The sun overhead gave everything a surreal, almost dreamlike quality - A part of her almost worried she’d wake to find this some cruel dream. She reached the home she remembered: A small mudbrick hut, with a door painted in a now chipped and frayed yellow. And if she looked closely, she could see the window she peered out of on that fateful day when the soldiers came and took her away. To be a soldier, to be a slave.\n\nShe knocked on the door. First, and then second, then a third - Her long journey had given her no patience. It opened and she was greeted with-\n\nHer not so little brother, Ahabwe, standing in the door. He was sporting a full beard and now standing just a bit taller than she was. She looked into his eyes and saw a thousand memories spring forth from them, alighting like fireflies in the dusk. “Dia?”\n\nAnd before she could even respond, she felt his arms around her, his weight almost causing her to buckle. When did he get so big? She could only laugh. “Yes, Ahab, it is me.”\n\nHe pulled back, meeting her once more. “I- When the soldiers came, I never stopped wanting to find you. I- I’m sorry.”\n\n“It is ok, I’m home now. Where’s mother and father?”\n\nNo reply, only Ahabwe’s repeated blubbering of “I’m sorry.”.\n\nDiata’s chest felt like it was on fire, but she steeled herself. “Did they live well?”\n\n“They… they didn’t think you’d return.”\n\nShe nodded, looking out to the rest of the houses. “I need to speak to the elders, here and those of all the villages in the area.”\n\n“But- but you just got home-”\n\n“I am home, and I’m gonna keep it. And if that means ensuring soldiers can NEVER take children, NEVER massacre families again? Then it was a foolish thing, making me a soldier.”"
 binsplosion_events.6.a:0 "We tire of this. Bribe her."
 binsplosion_events.6.b:0 "Hunt her down. Now."
 binsplosion_events.6.c:0 "Perhaps if we granted her control of the surrounding villages…?"

 binsplosion_events.8.t:0 "Taafi Refusals"
 binsplosion_events.8.d:0 "Chamakomo stood before his gathered fellows, other elders of the Taafi Clans. The noon winds swept over their meeting ground, a small rise dominating the surrounding brushland. “The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wishes us to send our sons to war.” A few laughs followed, while the more serious men frowned. Chamakomo continued. “According to them, it would be a ‘great honor’ to serve the rightful heirs of the Fangaulan Empire.”\n\n“Perhaps our cattle will herd themselves!” Yelled one.\n\n“Or shall the fields sow one another?” Inquired another.\n\n“Indeed, kin, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] demands we send the few young we have, not caring that it would doom us to starve, and if many didn’t come back…”\n\n“It would seem a fine way to end us, who have long been a strange thorn in the side of many a ruler.” Chamakomo mused, before proclaiming. “If the kingdom asks for our young, do not send them, nor our planetouched. And if they send forth people to collect them, make your young scarce. We are few, but we are proud, and we will not bow and give our future for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to throw into the fires of their pointless wars!”"
 binsplosion_events.8.a:0 "A tribe so small couldn’t bolster our armies anyways."
 binsplosion_events.8.b:0 "Implement higher tribute duties on any village who complains."
 binsplosion_events.8.c:0 "I doubt they’ll refuse to obey if we bolster their camps with extra resources."

 binsplosion_events.9.t:0 "Nobility Demand Replacement"
 binsplosion_events.9.d:0 "To the ‘[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’: Cousin, I come to you with an announcement. For over two centuries, the empire of Fangaula has languished half dead. Only the great imperial houses of the Binwarji recognized a successor to Hamadu the Imprunent, that of course being your ancestor.\n\nHowever, it has come to our attention that the kingdom is under great threat. Gnolls from the north and west, Ogres and their strange magics, and now planetouched rebels rise up across the land. Your army does not respect you, and your subject tribes wonder if they could do better alone. We Binwarji are sworn to the empires of Aro and Biakata, to God, but not to you.\n\nWe demand you relinquish your throne to me, and henceforth support my endeavors in turning the fate of the realm around and restoring its authority.\n\nRising sense of responsibility and power,\n\nMamadi Pandiga”"
 binsplosion_events.9.a:0 "Have my throne, damn you!"
 binsplosion_events.9.b:0 "Know your place, servant."
 binsplosion_events.9.c:0 "If we fail, they may drag my corpse off the throne."

 binsplosion_events.10.t:0 "Dendugma Steel Crusaders"
 binsplosion_events.10.d:0 "Wegbaja heard the ringing of hammers, and the steel-song of the blessed forging as the crusaders came into view as they ascended the slopes of the sacred volcano Junansuar. A small crowd had gathered before them, to partake in the festival, while the leader of the group addressed them. \n\n“Greetings, brothers and sisters!” The man wore striped robes of many colors, but beneath the cloth Wegbaja could see platemail, shimmering like oil over water. “Long have we ventured into the southward jungles, to fight beast and man alike! Long have we sung the praises of God and His Aspect, Mojobaa the celestial furnace! Long have we been away to procure the ancient and most sacred of materials: Ironwood!”\n\nAt this, his companion-smiths raised the products of their forging up high in the clear noon sky. Wegbaja could see spearheads, arrowheads, and even blades and axes, all glistening with the same shimmer: Dendugma steel.\n\nMany hours of celebration followed, Wegbaja and his people dancing and feasting until the sun dipped and rose again."
 binsplosion_events.10.a:0 "We cannot afford to lose them."
 binsplosion_events.10.b:0 "We shall chip in to these festivities, hail the crusaders!"
 binsplosion_events.10.c:0 "Let them return."

 binsplosion_events.11.t:0 "Bankartineni Rises Up"
 binsplosion_events.11.d:0 "Dawn beckoned as Mamadi Pandiga stood before the nobles, the sprawling Savanna stretching below them. “The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] continues in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] failure.” He announced, “All across the realm, invaders ravage us, rebels tear us apart from the inside, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does nothing!” Upon hearing the fury in his voice, the nobles roared in agreement, some slamming the ends of their spears into the ground, a drumbeat to the declaration.\n\n“And then there are the planetouched, who have for countless years caused us endless strife! How can we rebuild authority, when there are those who cause chaos wherever they go? As accursed Banni has proven, true atonement is impossible for them, the only answer is to cut out the weed before it roots.”\n\nAn elder spoke up. “Are you sure? We cannot so callously speak of killing innocent chi-”\n\n“There are no innocents!” Declared Pandiga, ancient descendant of one of Aro’s great companions. “There are only those who do what they’re told, and those who cause trouble. If we are to restore the empire, then we must learn…”"
 binsplosion_events.11.a:0 "Damn it all!"
 binsplosion_events.11.b:0 "Traitors!"
 binsplosion_events.11.c:0 "Authority begins when everyone is beholden to the state. Everyone."

 binsplosion_events.12.t:0 "Sakul Rises Up"
 binsplosion_events.12.d:0 "”This is to be given to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with the utmost haste, as a continuation of the report by Ngolo Folforo on the ‘Ogre Problem’.\n\nThirteen villages have gone missing this past month, four more than the previous month. But it is worse than that: They are eating mages. Gaining their power, using it to conjure sandstorms. I have seen it with my own eyes. I’ve tried to warn as many villages as I can, and move people away from the border, but I am only one person. More and more fall beneath the ceaseless shadow of the sands each week, never to be seen again.\n\nI write this because I beseech the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for aid. I understand there are many threats to the realm that all must be dealt with, but I have seen firsthand the horror of the hungering sands, and I know that if the ogres make it south, then…”"
 binsplosion_events.12.a:0 "Damn it all!"
 binsplosion_events.12.b:0 "March north and crush these beasts!"
 binsplosion_events.12.c:0 "THE END OF BINWARJI IS FINALLY AT HAND!"

 binsplosion_events.13.t:0 "Keledugu Rises Up"
 binsplosion_events.13.d:0 "Buruku ‘the Nomeko’ strode triumphantly around the arena’s grounds, as he had done hundreds of times before, hand raised to catch the praise of the crowd, the glory of the victory. Only this time, the crowd was formed by his fellow gladiators, and those in the arena with him were their former guards, now prisoners after his rebellion.\n\n“Five days ago, we broke our chains, and took back what was ours - our freedom!” He spoke in a booming voice, as his many years of fighting had trained him to do, “And today, we shall make sure we keep it.” Buruku swivelled on his sandal heels, facing his ‘opponents’. At a snap of his fingers, daggers rose from the dirt in front of them. “If you kill me, you get to walk out of here, and return to your master like the mangy dogs you are. But if I kill you… I will have your bodies displayed atop the arena, to show your comrades what happens to those who challenge the champions.”\n\nAnd then he stood back, releasing the stone bindings shackling the six guards to the ground. A second passed, before five ran at him. He grabbed the first one, throwing him at two others before wrestling the dagger from the fourth, jabbing it in his chest before grabbing the throat of the fifth who tried to sneak up behind him. He proceeded to dispatch all of them, in gruesome and bloody ways which made the crowd cheer for the spectacle they once partook in.\n\nThen the sixth and final one rose, sprinting - to the walls, to freedom. But a sickening crunch was heard as the Nomeko sent a stone flying towards him, and put a stop to that display of cowardice. And then it was over, Buruku standing in the blood of his enemies, arms arrayed in prayer-praise of his great craft.\n\n“You can achieve anything you want, be anyone you want!” He told the crowd. “All you need is…”"
 binsplosion_events.13.a:0 "Damn it all!"
 binsplosion_events.13.b:0 "Bring them to heel!"
 binsplosion_events.13.c:0 "The courage to seize it!"

 binsplosion_events.14.t:0 "Taafisi Rises Up"
 binsplosion_events.14.d:0 "Chamakomo held aloft the severed head of the man sent to kill him the night prior, before the now armored group of elders. “Behold now, the price of kings!” As the gasps came over the crowd, he continued, “This assassin came into my home, to slay me in my own bed, in front of my wife and children!”\n\n“Accursed tyrant! May a Devouring Gourd feast on his privates!” One elder proclaimed, his hands shaking with emotion, “These animals tell us we need to act civilized and then they do this?”\n\n“There can be no compromise with the Binwarji, with these ‘Silvered Lords’, for they only know slaves and masters. We are neither, strangers from a distant land, who seek only to follow our traditions in peace. But it seems they do not intend to give us such a chance.”\n\nA young man strode forth, and raised his blade, proclaiming his vow. “No more lords or kings, now we choose our own way, we shall beat the drums of liberation like God’s aspect Makan!”\n\nChamakomo nodded. “It shall be hard, this land has never given us anything easily or for free, but…”"
 binsplosion_events.14.a:0 "Damn it all!"

 binsplosion_events.15.d:0 "Sango rushed into the forge, eyes wide with shock. ”Is it true? Are we really rising up against the Binwarji?”\n\nOshoma Hessu, the boy’s superior, gave him a steeled glare as he hammered at his latest work. “Only if they force our hand. If they know what is good for them, they won’t stop us.”\n\n“I do not understand! We are honorbound vassals of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], this is treason!”\n\nThe hammering ceased. “Sango, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has failed. Rebellions, invasions, and who will have to fix this? The Binwarji will tax us and conscript us, and take our Dendugma steel for wars they will falter in, like always.” The smith put a hand on the boy’s shoulder, “But we do not lose sight of what we value.”\n\n“I… I see.”\n\n“We shall go our own way, and continue to serve God before we serve foolish men.” At that, Oshoma held aloft what he had forged: A new spearhead for the Grandmaster, shimmering like the fires of the sacred mountain. “But all shall know that…”"

 binsplosion_events.16.d:0 "The tribes gathered at dusk, walking paths betwixt the great ironwood trees, to a rise deep within the Dao Nako.\n\n“Binwarji falls, and with it, the chains that bind us!” Declares a short, old man. “Though we are confined to the Dao Nako by ancient decree of Aro following our foolish allegiance to wicked Kaino, that does not mean we are not free. With the north in crisis, it is time for us to go our own way, like our cousins, the Jiromji further east.”\n\n“But Binwarji lusts for authority!” Declared a young man, “Though they gain nothing for it, they delight in wielding power over us, and will surely send warriors to bring us back under their yoke!”\n\nThe old man only sighed. “It is our sacred duty to reject violence, but in the defence of our people? We will do what we must.”"
 binsplosion_events.16.a:0 "Who cares for some isolated tribes in the jungle?"
 binsplosion_events.16.b:0 "None can deny MY authority!"

 binsplosion_events.17.t:0 "Fellow Kaino"
 binsplosion_events.17.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Kaino of Maikirow seek independence from their cruel Binwarji overlords. For them to rise against their oppressors, they have asked us, fellows of their tribe, to aid them!"
 binsplosion_events.17.a:0 "By ancient evil, we were bound!"
 binsplosion_events.17.b:0 "Were it so easy…"

 binsplosion_events.19.t:0 "An Insult!"
 binsplosion_events.19.d:0 "The Dunesole Ogres we allowed to pass through our lands to raid Binwarji seem to have been causing the rotten empire a lot of trouble. Delightful! However, that foolish “emperor” has apparently gotten in their head that we are to blame for their presence and as such for their magical attacks. Outrageous! I mean, it is true, but how dare they say it! Our warriors were already eager to bash the heads of those arrogant bastards in, but this will rile them up even further. Binwarji will soon be nothing more than an ugly stain in the history books!"
 binsplosion_events.19.a:0 "How dare they!"

 binsplosion_events.20.t:0 "Say our Names"
 binsplosion_events.20.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the false King of Binwarji decided they could try and appease us by empowering our planetouched gladiators, granting them autonomy and privileges. What folly, that we would forget their crimes! We shall only use these troops to crush them, when we can."
 binsplosion_events.20.a:0 "To the Strongest!"

 binsplosion_events.21.t:0 "A Home by any Means"
 binsplosion_events.21.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the decision by the oppressive and cruel kings of Binwarji to both attempt to conscript us and bolster our camps with additional supplies and weapons was a silly one! We shall not forget their atrocities inflicted upon us. With our newly gained power and independence, we shall carve out a homeland, and no longer be at the whim of idle charity or suffer the active malice of our neighbors. They can call us strange outsiders for our traditions, they can call us dangerous for our magic of memory and mind, but they will never again call us ‘servants’."

 binsplosion_events.22.d:0 "Long have we travelled, and finally we have arrived at this new land, how lush and wonderful it is. Surely with the chaos the humans are embroiled in, and our great strength, we shall easily achieve victory here, a land to dominate and call our own.\n\nBesides, the mage the humans sent to ‘talk’ with us was very tasty, and gave us great power. With it, we shall bring Fangaula to its knees!"

 binsplosion_events.23.t:0 "The Sons of Aro"
 binsplosion_events.23.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Silvered rally around us! No longer will we suffer the foolishness of these ill-chosen ‘Kings’, who speak of strength but act in weakness, who tell us of glory but deal only in shame. The Empire deserves a greater legacy and a greater king willing to fight to restore it!\n\nWith the support of the ancient Binwarji nobility, we shall surely depose the unworthy monarchs, restore authority, and end the scourge of the Planetouched forever!"
 binsplosion_events.23.a:0 "Rising sense of authority and power!"

 binsplosion_events.18.t:0 "The Order on the Mountain"
 binsplosion_events.18.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Binwarji allowing our crusaders to return have bolstered our forces and impressed upon us the need for independence. Already, the warriors sing of a free Dendugma, serving only God and His people! The plan, laid out by our warriors, is to push into the Dao Nako, secure the Ironwood supply, and create a new order across our lands, focussed not on oppression and fear, but on piety and good works."

 binsplosion_events.25.t:0 "Authority Strengthened"
 binsplosion_events.25.d:0 "Shackled men and women were dragged through the streets of the capital, betwixt great and ancient buildings erected by genie-bound golems in elder days. And just as the genies, these men and women were enemies of Fangaula, enemies of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], rightful heir to Aro and Biakata. They had risen up in rebellion, or had tried to invade and subjugate what was rightfully [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis].\n\nAnd though there may be more enemies on the horizon, more invaders and rebels to bring to heel, for now the many peoples of Fangaula know the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not to be ignored without dire consequences."

 binsplosion_events.26.t:0 "What the Ogres Owe Us"
 binsplosion_events.26.d:0 "During the last few years we have allowed the Dunesole Ogres to use our lands as the launching point for their magical attacks against Binwarji, encouraging them to continue and increase their harassment campaign to speed along the decline of the rotten carcass on our southeastern border. It seems these vengeful giants have encountered way more success than we expected, and, taking advantage of the collapse of the imperial remnant, they have carved out a small state of their own right at our border. Congratulations are in order! In fact, we should send a delegation right away, to make sure they have not forgotten that they owe everything they have to our support and friendship. Since they are new to the concept of having a nation of their own, it would also be convenient to inform them that, when a small nation owes its entire existence to another, it is considered proper conduct to bend the knee to their benefactor and send tribute. This could be the beginning of a prosperous, beautiful and mutually beneficial relationship as we enter the imminent era of imperial gnollish rule over Fangaula. Provided, of course, they are not so stupid as to reject this most generous offer of ours."
 binsplosion_events.26.a:0 "I have always wanted an ogrish tributary!"
 binsplosion_events.26.b:0 "We have no interest in their tribute."
 
 binsplosion_events.27.t:0 "Beware of Gnolls Bearing Gifts"
 binsplosion_events.27.d:0 "One wonders whether there is such a thing as a selfless gnoll. We always knew the gnollish support of our cause was not in any way altruistic. This belief was confirmed to be true by the honeyed yet poisonous words of the gnollish envoy we have recently received. The dogs demand our submission and tribute as payment for their “continued support and friendship”. Implicit in the request is a threat of punishment should we dare reject their ‘generous’ offer. While bowing to these dogs would be a profound humiliation, it seems like maintaining some pretense of cordiality might be in order. After all, if a few shiny trinkets can guarantee the security of our northern flank while we take care of the treacherous humans in the south, would it not be utter foolishness to refuse that deal?"
 binsplosion_events.27.a:0 "Humiliating, but necessary."

 binsplosion_events.28.t:0 "The Ogres Kneel"
 binsplosion_events.28.d:0 "As expected, the Dunesole Ogres of Sakul have begrudgingly accepted our demands of their subjugation, and already the first tribute caravans arrive at our capital, filled with the plundered riches of the former Binwarji heartland. If even these giants willingly bend the knee when faced with our might, how could the rest of Fangaula possibly resist us? The Zuultanate will rule every corner of the Land of Authority!"
 binsplosion_events.28.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 binsplosion_events.29.t:0 "The Ogres Refuse to Kneel"
 binsplosion_events.29.d:0 "We knew ogres had thick skulls, but we never imagined their stupidity would reach this level. The delegation we sent to demand tribute never returned. Their warriors stand ready at their border with us, as if daring us to make a move, or perhaps even threatening to make it themselves. They think their size and brute strength make them unbeatable! We ought to teach them a lesson for daring to disrespect the Zuultan. Perhaps once they have been thoroughly crushed they will reconsider our generous offer, although we fear by then it might be much too late for that."
