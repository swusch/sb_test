 ### Missions

 Y96_finish_mainland_conquest_title:0 "Conquer Gowon"
 Y96_finish_mainland_conquest_desc:0 "If we wish to be considered the legitimate rulers of Gowon, we must drive Danggun into the sea. Displaying our strength in such a way would certainly bring more Shuvüüsh to these lands and aid us in controlling the locals and integrating them in Guwaadun culture."
 Y96_develop_economy_title:0 "Develop Gowon"
 Y96_develop_economy_desc:0 "Gowon is a land rich in potential: the Giteuni, Chimbija and Wonju do not know how good they have it. Their land is fertile and fit for cultivation of tea, their coast brimming with fish and their mountains are laden with gold.\n\nDeveloping this land and increasing our state revenue would both aid ourselves financially and strengthen our grasp upon these lands, which will aid us in integrating them into our superior Guwaadun realm."
 Y96_build_bhengudak_temple_title:0 "Bhen-Ak Temple"
 Y96_build_bhengudak_temple_desc:0 "This land is a foreign one; instead of protecting themselves against harmful spirits, they aim to strike uneasy truces with them and let them possess their shamans.\n\nThese people are sick at worst and misguided at best. We must cleanse this land of their vile beliefs and cease their consorting with evil spirits. Let us build a grand temple to Bhengudak, right in Bhengutai."
 Y96_nakseseom_cult_title:0 "Nakseseom Temple"
 Y96_nakseseom_cult_desc:0 "The isle of Nakseseom is home to many spirits the Neokttareum consider to be cornerstones of their faith. It is also the only place where one can clearly commune with what perhaps can be considered the leading spirit of their faith, Manjang.\n\nThis fact paired with the isle being closer linked to the spirit world than almost anywhere else and the abundance of ancient ruins makes it worthy of a temple, so that our people of different faiths may benefit from this isle."

 ### Events
 guwaamud.1.t:0 "Winds Of Change"
 guwaamud.1.d:0 "Gowon is a region rich in history and tradition, much of it quite similar to our own due to the influence of the first kingdom of Guwaamud. It is us who are being influenced this time around however, our children are raised by Gowon retainers and educated by native mentors, many speaking their language before learning the tongue of their ancestors.\n\nAs the Shuvüüsh of Guwaamud embrace more and more of the eastern culture, we are faced with a decision; either we embrace the winds of change and continue to nurture this trend to ingratiate ourselves with our subjects, or we uphold our own traditions which allowed our forefathers to conquer this land."
