 #The final flight of the Escanni
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.t:0 "The Final Flight of the Escanni"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d:0 "Twenty years ago, one of the great catastrophes of History befell Escann, a seemingly endless tide of green pouring out of the Serpentspine to lay waste to the kingdoms on the surface. One by one the kingdoms of Escann fell, and in the confusion and chaos countless denizens lost their lives. Many fled west to seek a safe haven, scattering across the continent towards havens from Bayvic to Nathalaire, but only the lucky few made it.\nFor twenty years, wave after wave of refugees have arrived at the edge of our realms, one torn family at a time.\nBut today, at last, the final group of refugees has reached us. Today the flight of the Escanni comes to an end.\n\nNow is the time to look onwards and build a future alongside our newfound denizens. The path may be rocky, as we have witnessed already in the past, but the only way now is forward."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d2:0 "During the Greentide many denizens of Escann fled westwards. Through the combined efforts of Gawed, Arbaran and Damescrown, these refugees were welcomed across western Cannor and distributed around the Dameshead. This refugee crisis brought with it a wave of new ideas, as among those that fled Escann were nobles, scholars and knights. But it also strained nations that were busy fighting in the fourth Lilac War, leading to some nations refusing refugees.\nOur realm wasn’t able or willing to partake in the effort to help the refugees until recently; some refugees now seek shelter in our lands, and it is up to us to accommodate them until they settle down or hopefully reclaim Escann."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.a:0 "Only time will tell whether this is a boon or not."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.b:0 "We'll try to help them settle in."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.c:0 "Great, more dependents, they will have to take care of themselves."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.e:0 "Let's help them go back to Escann swiftly."
 escanni_refugees_settlement_100_tt:0 "Moving forwards we will have to deal with the refugees in our lands.\n"
 
 #Escann Stands
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.t:0 "Escann Stands"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.d:0 "“Escann Stands”\nThose words are on the lips of town criers and merchants alike, to the exclusion of all else. Even from the window of the meeting room in [This.Capital.GetCapitalName], many common folk and refugees can be seen gathering around one such crier and listening to their tales, enraptured.\nInside the meeting room a different scene plays out, but the matter at hand is the same. An emissary from the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName] stands opposite of [This.Monarch.GetTitle] [This.Monarch.GetName]. His charge is simple; he carries with him the following message:\n“Escann Stands, the Greentide is at an end and all those that wish to go to the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName] are welcome to do so!”."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.a:0 "The age of the Greentide might be near its end."
 
 #The call of Home
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.t:0 "The Call of Home"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.d:0 "“Home”. To the Escanni refugees this word has a different connotation than for our people. To them “Home” is something lost, something that was destroyed and taken away from them. So when the Escanni say that “they are going home”, they do not say it lightly.\nThe reclamation of Escann has now begun in earnest, fledgling states establishing themselves in the smouldering ruins of Escann. Even though most are former adventurer bands that took the opportunity of claiming the riches of an abandoned land, they now seek to call home the former inhabitants of Escann.\nMost of these new nations have now dispatched messengers across western Cannor, spreading the word that the Escanni now have a homeland to come back to. And many refugees are heeding this call, leaving one group at a time towards the East.\n\nWe cannot stop them by force, but we can choose to help their venture; after all, Escann is still a dangerous place. What say you my [This.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.a:0 "They can call this land “Home” too if they want."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.b:0 "Good riddance."
 escanni_refugees_settlement_102_b_tt:0 "They do not reach Escann."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.c:0 "We will provide an escort, to protect their convoy."
 escanni_refugees_settlement_102_c_tt:0 "They reach Escann."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.e:0 "CTD prevented, report the bug."
 escanni_not_migrating_tt:0 "The refugees will remain in our care."
 escanni_migrating_tt:0 "The refugees will leave for Escann."

 #Result of our refugee policy
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.t:0 "Result of our Refugee Policy"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.d:0 "It is a small thing, to hear children laugh together while playing, but it is a newfound peace for the Escanni. The parents in Escanni households tell stories where local folklore reinterpreted from their point of view, and Escanni staple dishes reimagined with local meats and legumes are being served to their children. No longer is there a divide between them and us. We now see each other as we truly are. We both share these lands, and they are welcome here."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.d2:0 "Indifference and fatigue: this is how most of our citizens would describe their feelings about refugees in our lands. This isn't necessarily for the worse; we tolerate each other, and that's a minimum if we desire to live in the same lands.\nIn the past few years the situation in the refugee communities has evolved in accordance with this policy. While we can still try to influence proceedings and results of this evolution it might prove costly.\n\nWhat shall be our direction?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.d3:0 "Our relationship with the refugees has soured greatly in the last few years. Some policies we have enacted have greatly upset them, and now the repercussions can be felt in any refugee settlement. They aren't hostile to us, but they have clearly closed ranks and do not desire to stay here.\nThey very much welcome our support for their return to Escann, and thank us for enabling them to return “Home”. Still, they do not know the dangers that still roam Escann; should we warn them or provide an escort? They might not make it if we stay idle."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.a:0 "We shall escort them safely to their new home."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.b:0 "They are free to go, but we will not help them."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.c:0 "Try to better their situation."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.103.e:0 "We welcome our new citizens with open arms."

 #Infamous robbers
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.t:0 "Infamous Robbers turn out to be Escanni refugees"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.d:0 "Robberies have skyrocketed across [This.GetName] in the past few years; after an investigation, it has been revealed that a group of refugees turned thieves were the culprits. The band have been stealing from people of all walks of life, looting everything from food to precious items, but they have never turned to outright violence.\nThey have been brought to [This.Capital.GetCapitalName] to be judged. Our people demand justice be brought to them at a sword’s edge. There are no questions of whether or not they are guilty; damning proof has been procured.\nYet the robbers claim that they had no choice but to turn to banditry because of their living conditions. As they deem their cause just, they demand a trial by combat as their traditions dictate.\n\nShould we abide by their ridiculous request or deal with them as we would for any other robbers?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.a:0 "The law shall take care of this accordingly."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.b:0 "Maybe our treatment of the refugees is wrong, we are to blame."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.c:0 "Let them have a trial by chivalry as their tradition dictates."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.301.e:0 "They are naught but thieves anyway, seize their assets and banish them."
 
 #Artisans complain
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.t:0 "Artisans Complain over Unregulated Competition"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.d:0 "A new popular good has spread in [This.GetName]: small trinkets carved out of wood and fashioned with straw, depicting foreign cavaliers and knights. While this is not something completely novel in itself, the origin of these trinkets is new. They are manufactured by Escanni refugees as a means to earn money, these symbols of a foreign culture very popular amongst our nobles and now even competing directly with some local toy makers.\nIn itself this is not an issue, to us anyway. But the local artisans are complaining that the refugees operate outside of any guilds, thus presenting unfair competition. As such the guilds have come forward and asked us to step in, as they do not want to bear any responsibility regarding this.\n\nWhat should be our approach?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.a:0 "Make the guild hire those Escanni artisans, they too have to operate under our regulations."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.b:0 "We can't have our artisans outcompeted by refugees and vagrants."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.c:0 "Nothing is as sweet as free labour."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.302.e:0 "Good craftsmen are always welcome in Esmaria."
 
 #Stories of the Greentide rouse our people
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.t:0 "Stories of the Greentide Rouse our People"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.d:0 "The refugees in our lands fled the Greentide and the chaos of war brought by the orcish hordes, and they have witnessed many horrors in Escann: from the soldier that survived the frontlines, seeing his brethren torn apart as their entrails splashed upon him, to the father unable to save his wife and son from the horror of starvation during their exodus.\nSuch gruelling stories and tales are often shared with the denizens of the towns and villages that live close to their settlements, riling them up and agitating the masses.\nFear and anger are spreading within our populace, all directed at the orcs and goblins of the Greentide for the horrors they have wrought. Panic could spread if left unchecked; this could be a problem, but it could also be leveraged to our benefit.\n\nWhat will be our course of action?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.a:0 "I too have heard the stories, and their anger is justified."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.b:0 "Appease the masses, our people do not need to be agitated so."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.c:0 "They are threatening the peace in our lands, crack down on the storytellers."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.e:0 "They should try to be more open minded."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.303.f:0 "They will be avenged, this I swear."
 
 #Distinguished refugees wish to join our court
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.t:0 "Distinguished Refugees Wish to Join our Court"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.d:0 "Those who fled Escann were not all peasants or artisans; some were more distinguished. Skilled traders, nobles and even renowned commanders fled when their kingdoms fell at the hand of the Orcs.\nSuch figures have found their way to our lands and they have now come forward seeking to join our ranks - for an appropriate reward, of course.\nHiring such talented individuals would be wise and could provide us with valuable assets in our court, but not everyone will appreciate their presence. Our own nobles and scholars might feel slighted by our decision, and as such we must exercise caution.\n\nMy [This.Monarch.GetTitle], what is your wisdom?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.a:0 "Trade knows no borders."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.b:0 "Recruit the commander, have them teach us the Escanni way of the sword."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.c:0 "We needed to refurbish the decoration of our halls, this is a good opportunity."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.e:0 "They are refugees, not migrants. They shall remain as such."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.304.f:0 "All that wish to join us shall, hire all of them."
 
 #Exiled soldiers wish to join the reclamation of Escann
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.t:0 "Exiled Soldiers Wish to Join the Reclamation of Escann"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.d:0 "Rumours of the budding success that adventurer companies are achieving in Escann has spread in the refugee communities and some seem to desire to join up with the adventurers to fight for their lands. The first official request to be trained for battle and then guided back to Escann has been delivered to us this morning.\nThese men and women seem hardy enough, but most of them have yet to see battle; sending them to Escann directly would probably be sending them to their death. We could respect their wishes and train them before they join the reclamation of Escann.\nThe other option is to use their desire for battle to our own ends, as we always need more men for our armies.\n\nWhat will we do with them?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.a:0 "Draft them into our army, they will be useful."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.b:0 "They have a right to fight for their lands; direct them to adventuring companies."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.305.c:0 "They shouldn't waste their lives on misguided desires."
 
 #Food supplies strained by overpopulation
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.t:0 "Food Supplies Strained by Overpopulation"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.d:0 "What we feared has come to pass, the granaries in multiple towns are almost empty. There are simply too many mouths to feed, the supplies and infrastructure of our nation unable to handle both the refugee population and our citizens. Something has to be done and we might have to choose who to feed. Famine is on the horizon if we do not act; not even the mice can find sustenance, the ravens and the crows have begun fleeing to other regions and are being hunted as subsistence fowl.\nSo far our planning and rationing have proved inefficient and after a harsh winter and a dry summer we have almost nothing left. Some of our allies might be able to help, if our purse doesn't do the trick of course.\nBut if we do not want our people to go hungry we must make a decision, one that might be hard; no one should starve, but do we value the refugees’ lives as much as we do our own people’s?\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.a:0 "Import all we need, no one will starve in our lands."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.b:0 "Implement rationning of the supplies we have, let us hope that suffices."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.c:0 "Our hands are tied, brace for the worst."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.e:0 "Our allies have our back, we will ask a favour from them."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.306.f:0 "Divert our exports to aid to the refugees."
 
 #Escanni Hedge-Mages run rampant!
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.t:0 "Escanni Hedge-Mages Run Rampant!"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.307.d:0 "Escanni wizards and witches have travelled and settled down in our lands with the refugees. With the chaos of the Greentide, many have turned against the dogma of the Magisterium and operate without licence.

If we don't get this under control soon, our whole territory might be engulfed by this disease. Our officials suggest quarantining the refugees and sending them help; this would be costly, but if we don't help the refugees, their fate is likely sealed.

The journey through the Greatwoods had been long and hard, and Robyn had known many a neighbour snatched away by the monsters in those dark woods. They had lit fires and muttered prayers to Agrados, if only for the will to persist. It was only with great luck they had managed to make it to Bayvic. And in Bayvic, they had found a strange sort of kinship, not with the Blue Reachmen but with the other refugees. The White Reachmen, and the Tarics and Cagodics of the Northern Pass. They were all kin, in a strange and forlorn sort of way.\n\nPerhaps his people and the other refugees that came to this place were like the river he looked over every day.

Throughout the journey, he faced gnolls and bandits and worse, whispers in the mire, things that haunted him now as much as the Greentide itself.\n\nWithin a week, Yorric had run out of money, and facing his family sleeping in the streets, he made a deal with a devil. For his new employer he was a steel fist, forcing debtors to cough up crowns and serving as a silent warning when standing beside the wretch in meetings with his fellow vagabond-lords.\n\nHis wife told him he was a hero, that he was the reason she and their two children could eat hot food and sleep in warm beds, and everytime he came home to them safe, he believed her.

For the next several nights, there was feasting and celebration, though the King seemed uneasy, his gaze darting around the hall and nearly jumping out of his seat when she served him ale. He was quiet, and most of his talking was with the elders, ensuring that they were being treated well by their lord and other settlements.\n\nOn the final day, he gave a speech at dusk. He spoke of Marile’s people and their harsh journey from the east, escaping the Greentide into the Alenic Expanse. And he spoke of his father, who had escorted them and allowed them to settle within the northern realm, and had rallied with old enemies to halt the orcs at Rottenstep, giving his life for them. He ended his speech with an oath, to do by them as his father had, whether they stayed or left.\n\nBefore morning had come, he was gone, riding west, and though Marile would never see him again, she would oft see his soldiers patrolling nearby."

It was the Gawedi Prince Jon who gave the order: Mount up, ride through the horde, push into the center, kill Dookanson.\n\nAnd so it was that Varil and his Knights Magnificent rode with the Lorentish, Bennonians, and the Gawedi. Varil’s lance struck many an orc as the improvised cavalry charge slammed into the opposition, like a blade through water. Many perished that day, many of his brothers, and many he had considered great and honorable. But in the end, they had pushed back the Greentide, they found themselves a new hero to rally around, and Varil found himself a new god to worship.\n\nVaril Silcalas was born at Rottenstep.

We have music, the merchants have their wares in the stalls… We have food too."\nThe Esmari woman turned her gaze to the two barges drifting lazily down the narrow stream. Her expression wavered between amusement and disbelief.\n“Where are the colors? Where is the wild, pulsing music? Where is the ecstasy of sound, of drink, of bodies lost in dance?”\nYet as she watched, a feeling settled over her – a feeling strange and unfamiliar. A longing, not for the revelry she knew, but for something quieter. Something she had never lived, yet somehow missed all the same."

 #A Grand Chivalric Tournament
 escanni_refugees_settlement.409.t:0 "A Grand Chivalric Tournament"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.409.d:0 "My liege, many of the newest refugees to join us have proposed to celebrate our success and their return to Escann. They tell tales of grand jousts hosted in the time of their grandparents or great grandparents, and wish to witness and take part in one as it was done in the chivalric Escann of old.\n\nIf we want to reproduce an authentic “Escanni joust”, it will be at great expense, but it will surely be a fruitful endeavour! Of course, we could ask the refugees to simply fund their own proposal, but that might not be popular."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.409.a:0 "A marvelous idea! It shall be grand indeed."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.409.b:0 "Frivolous, if they contribute to it then we can organise it."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.409.c:0 "This is a waste of time."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.409.e:0 "An old tradition we shall honour."

 #Refugees Bring Back Manufcatoring Knowledge from the West
 escanni_refugees_settlement.410.t:0 "Refugees Bring Back Western Manufactoring Knowledge"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.410.d:0 "The damage done by the Greentide can be measured in many ways. There was obviously a hefty toll in lives for the Escanni people, but they also lost a lot of their knowledge and methods in the exodus and conflict.\n\nBut not all such lore was lost, and while most refugees returning are peasants and soldiers, some are artisans and scholars who carry with them what we need to rebuild what was lost. By investing in the ventures of these new citizens, we could reignite Escanni artisanry.\n\nWhat shall we do, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.410.a:0 "Give them a stipend so they can set up their production."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.410.b:0 "It's too expensive, let them settle and nothing else."

 #Foreigners in a Familiar Land
 escanni_refugees_settlement.411.t:0 "Foreigners in a Familiar Land"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.411.d:0 "Dozens of missives from multiple towns and cities across the realm pile up in the archives. All of them report the same thing: the former inhabitants of these lands have begun returning en masse. These resettlers are generally rather confused and concerned by our presence here, but they have recognised our achievements nonetheless and desire to join our realm; they only request for us to let them worship their own gods.\n\nTheir aid would help us control these lands and expand more easily, but it might be at the cost of the stability of the realm. Otherwise, we could always banish them and bar their entrance into our realm, but the other Escanni realms might not appreciate this decision.\n\nGreat [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], what does your wisdom advise?"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.411.a:0 "Let them settle these lands, but we won't let them worship false gods, not openly."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.411.b:0 "Grant them autonomy and freedom of worship."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.411.c:0 "We have enough trouble as is, bar their entry."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.411.e:0 "They lost these lands once already, they are ours now."
