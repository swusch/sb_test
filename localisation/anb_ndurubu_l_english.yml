 unite_the_ndurubu_desc:0 "The Ndurubu Confederation and the forty tribes that formed it were shattered into three warring states after the murder of the elected king Imaro by malcontent traditionalists. The reactionary Atijoko, led by the prolific raider Bwana Sinnaban, clung to the old ways in the east; while the young king Diakarida led the Kuraoko around the ancestral capital of Fojara. In the west, the Fire Planetouched Luro Vual rallied several tribes under the banner of a planetouched supremacist ideology, and ruled the land with a fiery fist.\n\nDrawn by the internal conflict, vultures circled in the skies above the corpse of the confederation. The nomadic gnolls in the north seized the fortress of Xhazsaya, and were threatening the heartlands of Ndurubu. The greedy merchants of Kunolo similarly intervened from the south and seized Durpupa under the pretense of protecting themselves from cattle raids.\n\nThis sorry state of affairs ends now. We have defeated all rivals and interlopers and proved ourselves as the true heirs of the Confederation, which will soon be reborn in our image. With the tribes united, and ourselves as their leaders, no longer will the Ndurubu have to fear the yoke of foreign oppressors!"

 ndurubu_events.1.d:0 "“I am told the boy tyrant has finally been reunited with his foolish father, and that hotheaded imbecile in the west is dead once and for all. This calls for a celebration! Men, go get your horses, we are going on a raid. Where? Does it matter? We are lions, and the world is our prey!”\n\nLike any other people, we Ndurubu are defined by our traditions. And as we are obviously the bravest and proudest across all Halann, those traditions should be held as uniquely sacred and untouchable. When someone threatens this exalted order, bestowed to us by Fojara Himself, there is little else to do but to impale them with the sword, be they slave or king. Protecting the legacy and future of our people is a noble task that allows for no mercy and compassion. But the deed was left unfinished, and we fell into civil war, the very existence of our confederation under threat of death, be it through outside invasion or internal corruption. But our cause was righteous, as it was the cause of the old and proven ways. Fojara was clearly on our side, regardless of what the pretenders might have proclaimed, and so we were brought to victory. Bwana Sinnaban, victor in a hundred raids, has become the victor in this war for the very soul of the Ndurubu! He is the paladin of tradition, the champion of the old ways, undefeated in combat, first among the lions and favorite of Fojara! And with his spear held aloft, riding in the vanguard, he leads us to glory, and to rule over Fangaula!"

 ndurubu_events.2.d:0 "“Father, can you see me? The deed is done, our family avenged and the traitors dead, I alone rule over the vast savannah our people call home. Tell me then, why do I feel no satisfaction? Oh, Great Fojara, so much left to be done…”\n\nIn our hearts we always knew the cause of the Kuraoko was blessed by God, and that the reforms we initiated were something that Fojara desired for our people. When the Atijoko slaughtered our rightful king and his family, with only his youngest son and heir escaping the massacre, that faith was put to the test. But the young prince rallied our desperate men and filled their souls with hope yet again. He spoke of a vision in his dreams, of our totem spirit and the path of glory that lay ahead for him. And now, the first part of this long path has been traversed. We put down the traitors, who dared call themselves guardians of tradition while being nothing but champions of rot and stagnation, with all the ruthlessness they had earned; we quenched the flames in the west and put Luro to the sword. We have resisted the threats of both gnolls and merchants, and will soon be ready to bring war and suffering to their lands in turn. The lands of the Ndurubu bow down to one king and one only, may his rule last an eternity! As he has brought a new day for our people, let us follow him on his path to bring a new dawn to all of Fangaula. The Land of Authority shall be shaped by the hand of the Lion Prince!"

 ndurubu_events.3.d:0 "“They laughed! They laughed at me! They called me abomination, bastard, they rubbed their power and their riches in my face, as if they could ever match the blessing God bestowed me! I came to the world with fire in my veins, and they thought they could laugh at me with impunity? Well, who is laughing now? They are dead, all dead, burnt to a crisp, and me? I am dancing through the flames, and I will never die!”\n\nLuro Vual Trawore is the ember that has set this rotten world aflame! The confederation was a relic, a pathetic shadow of itself, split and weakened by ridiculous petty squabbles. How could it not be thus, when it had fallen in the hands of the unblessed? How can a land filled with men who move mountains, shift rivers, command hurricanes and summon wildfires let mere mortals take the reigns of power and elevate themselves above their betters, the ones blessed by God? Reformists, traditionalists, they are all the same, pathetic little insects with delusions of grandeur. And that is why they lost! Because they fought with sticks and stones while we were born with mastery over nature itself! Who could be the champion of Fojara, but the Lion of Fiery Mane? The Victorious One, the storm of fire that burns all who oppose us. We fought for more than just lordship over the tribes of the Ndurubu, we fought for a new future in this land, one where power is in the hands of those born to wield it. An Age of Fire begins now, under the leadership of our King Crowned in Fire, and woe to any who dares stand in his way!"
