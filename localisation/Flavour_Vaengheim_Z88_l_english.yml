 Z88_old_friends_title: "Old Friends"
 Z88_old_friends_desc: "“I swear upon my name an oath of friendship eternal, may no Járnklo ever sully the bond forged betwixt us this day.”\n- Matirach Krjá, to the leader of the Gerudian Warhost after the battle of Glodborg Pass, from the Tale of Krjá\n\nAcross the mountains of the Titans Rest lies Skaldskola, the realm of our oldest and dearest allies. Seat of the Skalds, heart of the faith, mighty Skaldskola is the spiritual heart of all Gerudia – and though we are its guardians, it is easy to become isolated here atop the peaks. Let us renew our bonds of alliance with the council of Skalds, for in this time of cold and uncertainty, there is no better warmth to be found than the hearth of a friend."

 Z88_offer_shelter_title: "Offer Shelter"
 Z88_offer_shelter_desc: "“Why squabble amongst yourselves, when instead at I may your ire be loosed?”\n- Leiv Snaketongue, to the Council of Celmaldor, from the Tale of Leiv Snaketongue\n\nGreat Bjarnrík quakes and convulses, torn between past and future, reaver and reformer. Her crown grows heavy and Bera’s blood weak. We take no glee from this, no - it is a tragedy indeed, and yet we of all peoples know that from the darkest moment may come the greatest relief. Our Battlemaidens spy much in their flights, and we see the conflict that brews there, sharpened swords that thirst for their kin’s own blood.\n\nSidaett, our westwards neighbour and richest of the Dalr realms, stands to lose much from this coming war. We shall reach out our hand to them in friendship and in guidance, and from the east give them hope - as we once received."

 Z88_ending_the_strife_title: "Ending the Strife"
 Z88_ending_the_strife_desc: "“Power is not born in blood, it is taken by those with will”\nFrom the Ebonfrost Epic\n\nWe wish not for war amongst Gerudians, but alas the skalds do not always sing of happy times. Sometimes conflict is unavoidable, even between those of one blood, and in such stories it is the duty of those who desire peace to fight for it. And so we shall, for none have ever said that the Járnklo fear war! Let our maidens take wing, and bring peace again to the people of Bjarnrík. They shall know it when Bera’s crown sits atop our Matriarch's head."

 Z88_troll_troubles_title: "Troll Troubles"
 Z88_troll_troubles_desc: "“I am Bera, Breaker of Troll-kind, and I say thus - they shall trouble us no more!”\n- Queen Bera upon presenting the head of Urgnak the Foul to her people, from the Beralic Saga\n\nTrolls are not the ancient foe of the Gerudian, for that honour goes to the Giants who they once served. No, trolls are the monsters of our stories, the terror in the trees, the fright of our young. They are a menace, one that almost wiped our people out before we had even taken roost here.\n\nYet it is also true that in a way they are not so unlike us. Were we not once called monsters too? Were we not hunted, not feared? Did we not flee here precisely because of that?\n\nNone of this washes away the guilt of the troll. None of our sympathy absolves them of the wrongs they have wrought. But perhaps we may offer them a hand, a path to redemption. It will be a long road, but under our wing? One day they may call themselves Gerudian too."

 Z88_from_trouble_to_toil_title: "From Trouble to Toil"
 Z88_from_trouble_to_toil_desc: "“Mine heart holds no wrath for the troll. I seek only to bring low the doers of evil deeds. And trolls do evil deeds aplenty.”\n- Bera, from the Beralic Saga.\n\nThe troll is a fascinating creature, possessed of an unending endurance and hardiness that rivals any that walks the earth. This we have seen in ample amounts, as we have set them to toil our lands and realm. When they are not possessed of the urge to destroy and kill they are quite amenable indeed. Perhaps then they have done enough to earn their respite. Perhaps with a final push they may join us as Gerudian - at least in some manner."

 Z88_worrying_words_title: "Worrying Words"
 Z88_worrying_words_desc: "“…For it is fair to die at sea, and sleep in waters deep. Worse yet to face the dragon’s dream, and die in fields of white, heart brought to halt by cold, soul locked away in ice.”\n- From the Dirge of the Deep, Stanza XVI, the song of Sea and Snow.\n\nIt has not been as easy as we hoped to bring the Reachmen to the fold. Their hearts harden against us and they reject the truth and necessity of the songs. Sweet Cassan has told us how vile agents whisper in their ears, compelling them to worship the dragon, she who must not wake. It is saddening indeed to bear witness to such folly, and it must be ended, for her waking would be the end of all. "

 Z88_magnate_menace_title: "Magnate Menace"
 Z88_magnate_menace_desc: "“The southerlings are soft, greed seeps into their hearts and renders their spirit weak - weak, and ripe for conquest!”\n- From the Ebonfrost Epic\n\nAt last the source of the unrest is revealed! These greedy magnates, who so desired the wealth and knowledge of Gerudia as to usher in the world's very doom! We forgive all who were swayed by their lies, for forked tongues and silver palms can lead many astray. But we cannot live safely whilst they lair still in their den, that city on the Alen that dreams itself master of the north. We shall show them who truly rules it."

 Z88_just_like_old_times_title: "Just Like Old Times"
 Z88_just_like_old_times_desc: "“I shall miss these hills, for though there is little beauty in them, they have been our home.”\n- Matriarch Krjá, leading her people out of the Moors, from the Tale of Krjá\n\nWhen we ruled the heights and moors, it was over the Moormen we ruled. In the time since then they have found new masters, and though we would not claim to have always been benevolent rulers as we are now, neither can such be said for the Gawedi who claimed dominion here. The Alenic frontier has never been a part of Gerudia, but we shall make it one now - for harpies roost here again!"

 Z88_descent_title: "Descent"
 Z88_descent_desc: "“Then did Bera’s band fall upon the trollish foe, and great blood was spilt and glories won.”\n- From the Beralic Saga\n\nNestled between the Bay of Chills and the Titan’s Edge, the peoples of Nyrvord know as little of Gerudia’s hardships as it is possible to know. The great mountains provide respite from the cold, and the bounty of the sea keeps their bellies fed. That is not to say they are a soft people - no, never would we dare place such an insult upon our kin and friends! But they do not know the cold like we do. They have not suffered hardship as we have. Better then for the coming age that we protect them - we shall be their guardians."

 Z88_ever_closer_title: "Ever Closer"
 Z88_ever_closer_desc: "“I rather like it down here with the wingless, thank you.”\n- Asfrid Ebonwing, from the Ebonsteel Chronicles\n\nThe Skalds of Skaldskola, our greatest friends, have proved their worth many times over - not that there was ever any doubt, of course. Now the time for Gerudia to stand as one draws near, and the matter of her unity requires us to ask our friends a favour. Apart we are mighty, but the shieldwall is always strongest when its warriors stand together, shoulder to shoulder and shields interlocked. We must ask this of our friends, that they join us in earnest, for the good of all Gerudia."

 Z88_home_and_safe_title: "Home Safe"
 Z88_home_and_safe_desc: "“So hold close the hearth, and let song warm the soul, for fair Gerudia is where we call home”\n- From the Old Winter Lullaby\n\nThe Taric are home, and clearly grateful beyond measure to be so. We are glad to have them, as they were stalwart defenders of the pass in ages past and shall no doubt be so again. We have allowed them their autonomy thus far, a measure of our good will and benevolence, but as Gerudia grows ever closer we begin to wonder about their place. They may not be of the same blood as we but they have lived in our realm as equals for long times since their first exodus. Many in the Council call to unite them into our kinship, to bring them into the realm at large and grant them seats and representatives. It shall be a great undertaking, but a worthy one."

 Z88_distant_reach_title: "Distant Reach"
 Z88_distant_reach_desc: "“Our same sea, yet it is upon distant shores that we cast our oars”\n- From the Lineages of Gerudian Adventurers\n\nMany centuries ago, the lands now known as the Alenic Reach were a part of Gerudia, and the peoples there considered themselves as such, as much as any man of the Dalr or Olavish. Those times are past, and yet with the dragon stirring we have need of voices greater to join the song. Perhaps as with many things those times may come again. We shall see."

 Z88_soothing_song_title: "Soothing Song"
 Z88_soothing_song_desc: "“-The Ebonwing can fight, yes. But they sing like a strangled crow. No true harpy that one…”\n– an admonishment of Asfrid, a recurring theme in the Tale of Asfrid Ebonwing\n\nMany hands make light work, and many voices make a chorus – both wholes greater than their parts alone. In the Skaldhyrric tradition it is oft that only a skald would sing the tales, but we Járnklo have our own ways. All harpies are singers, and we encourage all to be as us. To know and remember the tales is good, but to sing them with all the passion of the soul and fire of the spirit is what it truly means to know our faith. This we bring to the Reachmen, that together all may be greater."

 Z88_homecoming_title: "Homecoming"
 Z88_homecoming_desc: "“And in our days hence we will dream of those far away peaks, lands which once held our home.”\n- Matriarch Krjá addressing the host of Vaengheim after landing in Gerudia, from the Tale of Krjá\n\nAll Járnklo know where we came from, all Járnklo know the tale of our flight from the Dragonpeaks and moors, all Járnklo remember the violence and hate that drove us hence. Fate has conspired to return us to our long-taken home, now nest to kobolds and gnomes, among others. We could bring fire and hate and cast them hence, we could retake the peaks for ourselves and ourselves alone, but we shall not. Our journey here has taught us that all races may stand in honour, should they simply have the chance to do so."

 Z88_what_is_best_for_all_title: "What is Best for All"
 Z88_what_is_best_for_all_desc: "“So she slumbers, and we keep her thus, for surely she has no more desire to kill than we to die.”\n- The Tale of the Dragon Dreaming\n\nIt has never been for malice that we sing. There is no hate in it nor resentment. We fear the winter Elkaesal might bring, but we do not revile her for it. It is simply in her nature, as much a part of her as flight is to us. It is important that all who sing know this, for a voice stemming from a false heart strikes discord and disharmony. Only together in peace and purity of spirit can we do what is best for all."

 Z88_rise_to_action_title: "Rise to Action"
 Z88_rise_to_action_desc: "“But mighty Gjalund held no fear, he rose to the giant, axe in hand and action in heart”\n- From the Tale of the Gjalund\n\nOur first flight over Gerudia was made with trepidation. We hoped for a new home, but expected nothing more of these lands than what we fled - hostility and flame. And so it seemed we were destined to meet our end on these shores, as our motley flock fell victim to a trollish attack - yet from the east came humans, and with them hope. The men and women of Gerudia saved us that day, and for every day on we pledged them our friendship. Now foreign conquerors, orcs and Alenics alike, eye Gerudia’s white beauty with greed, whilst her people squabble amongst themselves.\n\nBut we shall hold no fear. Sound the horns of Krjá! We shall rise as Gerudia’s guardians, and make her peoples safe beneath our wings."

 Z88_battlemaidens_of_gerudia_title: "Battlemaidens of Gerudia"
 Z88_battlemaidens_of_gerudia_desc: "“Stand Strong Sisters! No mannish foe nor beast of nature will cast us hence.”\n- Matriarch Krjá at the Drekkodr stand, from the Tale of Krjá\n\nThe humans have many names for us, but chief among them is one we have taken as our own - Battlemaiden. A term of respect, a name earned from our prowess in the field, from the strength of our arm and weight of our heart.\n\nBut it is more than a name, for to be a Battlemaiden has become a calling. Young Járnklo dream of joining the ranks of our most elite, to themselves one day soar the skies of Gerudia on the hunt. In this time of strife we shall have need of the Battlemaidens more than ever, and so we must wet the blades of a new generation upon the field. Sound the horns, for the Járnklo hunt once more!"

 Z88_eastern_reach_title: "Eastern Reach"
 Z88_eastern_reach_desc: "“A fine land this shall be for us, with mighty metals and fish aplenty!”\n- Urvik to his Son Olav upon arriving in Gerudia, From the Tale of Olav and Urvik, the First Gerudians\n\nThe men of Urviksten are a tough and proud folk, ones no stranger to strife or war. Lead for many a century by the proud Ebonfrost dynasty, once Emperors of Castanor, they have known hardship and glory a plenty. A shame then to see them so reduced in power and might as now, on the brink of defeat at the hands of a new, albeit mighty foe. We shall not suffer to see these Gray Orcs claim more of Gerudia’s people. The proud men of Urviksten may protest, but they too must be brought beneath our wing."

 Z88_orcish_incursions_title: "Orcish Incursions"
 Z88_orcish_incursions_desc: "“...For Korgus had given Corin her banewound. Yet did Corin find her will, for she knew that her death alone, would be a death for many on this day. And she raised her sword…”\n- Corin’s Sacrifice\n\nThe Gray Orc is a fearsome foe indeed, a race unlike any other we have fought, possessed of a strength and savagery beyond that of man or harpy. And so they squat in the Giant’s Tears, having pushed the native Taric peoples aside and divided the area between their clans. Though the Taric are not Gerudian in blood they are as close as any may be, and many of their people now live in our lands - yearning for home.\n\nWe have taken the mantle of Guardian – now we shall prove what our words are worth."

 Z88_all_gerudia_title: "All Gerudia"
 Z88_all_gerudia_desc: "“Speak up, before the dragon awakes! No harm will come to you in my roost, and I would know the thoughts of my flock.”\n- Krjá, from the Tale of Krjá\n\nWhen first we blew the horns of Krjá, and named our cause to guard Gerudia, it was for this moment that we aspired. All Gerudia safe under our wing, united in her faith, the skalds standing together, strong again! What a wondrous thing it is, what a peace we shall know!\n\nThough our kinsman may pay us fealty, we have never desired to rule as tyrants. In our Gerudia all shall speak their minds. Let us reform the council of skalds, and give rise to a great secular council, one which shall advise the Matriarch and give all Gerudia a voice."

 Z88_submit_to_strength_title: "Submit to Strength"
 Z88_submit_to_strength_desc: "“It is a simple choice - kneel, or meet my steel.”\n- Asfrid Ebonwing, from the Ebonsteel Chronicles\n\nWhen the orcs first burst forth from the mountains they swept across the southern lands as an unrelenting tide. Pillaging, despoiling, destroying - they knew no mercy nor honour. That they ravaged so easily the realms of man is a cause for concern, for what if harm should once again have cause to turn north? We cannot abide an unprotected flank, and so must bring the area under our protection.\n\nWe must subjugate the men of Vrorenmarch for their own protection, and bring the orc to heel. They may be savage, but there is pride in them also, a respect for strength and strength alone. It is easy then, to see what must be done with them - they must see our strength played out before them, so shall we crush them on the field of battle! Then shall they submit, and know peace below us."

 Z88_worthy_warriors_title: "Brides of Battle"
 Z88_worthy_warriors_desc: "“We have been forged again, in Gerudia’s cold flame. From this day and for each day to come, we shall be more than we were.”\n- From the Tale of Krjá\n\nNever more true have the first matriarch's words been than today! From egg to ash the life of a Járnklo is one of battle, as soon as our fledglings first are strong enough to beat their wings they begin to train, strengthening their minds and bodies for war. Though not all who reach adulthood choose the life of a Battlemaiden, all are warriors in heart and spirit."

 Z88_burgeoning_bay_title: "Burgeoning Bay"
 Z88_burgeoning_bay_desc: "“It is true that gold cannot buy joy. Even so, I find life gentler in warm furs, after a glass of mulled wine.”\n- Leiv Snaketongue to the Council of Celmaldor, from the Tale of Leiv Snaketongue\n\nThe Bay of Chills has long been the centre of Gerudia’s trade, but now with both the Reach united beneath us and imports flooding in from our colonies overseas, the ports bloom and boom ever more with trade and commerce. Prosperity born from peace is never a thing to be underestimated, and we are proud to be its custodian. Let us flood the bay with goods aplenty so all may know the wealth of Vaengheim - of Gerudia!"

 Z88_faith_and_steel_title: "Faith and Steel"
 Z88_faith_and_steel_desc: "“Einherjar! They of ages past, souls of giants, bodies of Ebonsteel!”\n- The Tale of Ebonsteel Einherjar\n\nOn the final day of a Battlemaidens training, to determine their worth when they are set to leave the Joltvilqur and join the wing, they are asked a simple question - what is stronger, your faith or your steel?\n\nThere is no wrong answer, but the response determines the nature of their final test. Those who hold to faith must sing the tales atop the mountain, never letting their voice falter despite how they may shiver or quake. Those who hold to steel face a simpler test, yet no less challenging, for they must defeat one of their own.\n\nNo matter the choice, those who succeed are made stronger for it."

 Z88_worthy_of_legend_title: "Worthy of Legend"
 Z88_worthy_of_legend_desc: "“Fear was foreign as death they faced, eternal life in legend to chase.”\n- Tale of the Ebonsteel Einherjar\n\nThose who walk the earth fear death, and well they should, for to live without wanting life is not to live at all. But death is not when the body ends, nor when the light in the eyes goes out. To be remembered is to live, and to die is to be forgotten. It is the dream of all Járnklo to live forever, immortalised in song. It is the dream of all Járnklo to be worthy of legend."

 Z88_our_eternal_charge_title: "Our Eternal Charge"
 Z88_our_eternal_charge_desc: "“Guard the lair of the Dragon, let none disturb her sleep. This I task you for today and every today hence, for your lives, your daughters and their daughters, on til the ice melts and eternal summer blooms.”\n- The One Armed Skald, from the Tale of the Dragon Dreaming\n\nTo be Járnklo is to know duty. From the minute we are born we have purpose, taught to us the moment we are old enough to understand. We have a sacred charge, a higher calling, a responsibility to something greater than ourselves. We are to guard the entrance to the dragon's lair, to prevent any from entering. Everything that we have done since we first took flight at Matriarch Reginleif’s command has been in the name of that duty.\n\nIt is in the name of that same duty we now defy it. We shall enter the caves below the capital, for there is no other recourse left.\n\nElkaesal, we come to lay you to rest again."

 Z88_towards_the_frozen_north_title: "Towards the Frozen North"
 Z88_towards_the_frozen_north_desc: "“Beyond the resting titans, shadowed by black frost, lays a golden glade”\n- From the Tale of the Golden Forest\n\nHarpies are not born for the cold, and yet we endure. Our wings feel the bite of frost, our feathers freeze, and yet we endure. For here in the north is promise - for us, the promise of a home, of a place safe, a place our own. For others, the promise of riches – fur and gold, opportunity. Many of these men and women seek to settle the north, to push ever more toward the ice. Let us support them, for if there is one thing a Járnklo values, it is strength of heart."

 Z88_towers_of_today_title: "Towers of Today"
 Z88_towers_of_today_desc: "“So we sing, ere she wake and bring winter without end”\n- From the Old Winter Lullaby\n\nAcross Gerudia lay many wonders, among the greatest of which are the towers of the Skalds. Huge structures devoted to the preservation of our unique Skaldic magic, training and nurturing the next generation of Gerudia’s legendary storytellers. In many ways these towers serve as the organs of Gerudia, for without them we would forget all what and who we are.\n\nYet for all of that, so much has been forgotten already, including some of the very secrets our towers were supposed to preserve. Indeed, no new towers have been raised for many a winter. We shall begin the work to change this, to do more than simply preserve - to renew."

 Z88_on_wings_of_healing_title: "On Wings of Healing"
 Z88_on_wings_of_healing_desc: "“To mine roost I bring you, away from wars of men. And from the jaws of death I plucked you, that you may live again.”\n-Krjá, from the Tale of Krjá\n\nOn battlefields across Gerudia the sight of our battlemaidens is a welcome one. The greatest of the fallen are taken into their arms and delivered up to our roost, there to rest and recuperate, to join the honoured warriors among our number and propagate our line. Thus are we renowned not just for our prowess in battle but outside it also, for there is nary a better centre of healing in all the north than the roost of Vaengheim. But a lone roost shall not suffice in this time of war, as we shall have great need of healers. Let us train more in our arts, so that our warriors may take heart knowing that should they fall many hands will tend to them!"

 Z88_at_home_in_the_heights_title: "At Home in the Heights"
 Z88_at_home_in_the_heights_desc: "“Breathe - do you feel that upon the air? It is belonging which you taste.”\n- Asfrid Ebonwing, from the Ebonsteel Chronicles\n\nOur roosts are places of honour and respite for the heroes of Gerudia, the peak of a warrior's ambition, but in truth they are ill suited to human occupation. Harpies build for harpies, and our roosts are raised high, and full of structures and designs hostile to anyone that lacks the wings to fly. In times before we have accepted such disadvantage as the price of a place here, but as our numbers swell and more and more veterans are brought to the roosts, it becomes apparent that it is protector, not protected, that must change. With careful renovation and adjustments made for the wingless, soon all shall feel at home in the heights."

 Z88_ebonsteel_rekindling_title: "Ebonsteel Rekindling"
 Z88_ebonsteel_rekindling_desc: "“For Spell Song and Steel did Ebon-metal make”\n- From the Tale of Ebonsteel Einherjar\n\nWe know now there cannot be contentment, cannot be peace. Gerudia stands as one, and yet the snows worsen - the dragons stirs. We shall have need of great strength and fortitude in the times to come, strength as we once had in ages past - the unbreaking strength of Ebonsteel. Forgotten to man or harpy are its secrets, but Gerudia is a land of forlorn treasures, and under our guidance, what was once known may be unearthed once more. Let us scour the archives of the skalds and raise their towers anew - the song of Ebonsteel shall be sung again!"

 Z88_whales_of_west_title: "Whales of the West"
 Z88_whales_of_west_desc: "“HARK BROTHERS– A LEVIATHAN STIRS IN THE DEEP!”\n“Why Konungur, it's just a whale you dolt!”\n- From the Voyage of The North Raider\n\nThough whales are not among the many new discoveries in Aelantir, the sheer abundance of the animals to be found in the waters of Dalaire is astounding, and may so far be the greatest treasure we have found across the thaw. The whale has many uses, both in our blooming colonies and back at home, not least of which is in rendering its fat and oil. Whale oil, particularly sperm whale oil, burns clear and odourless, making it a fantastic source of heating and light in the cold north."

 Z88_the_other_north_title: "The Other North"
 Z88_the_other_north_desc: "“Look at these mountains, the pines and fjords - why, it almost seems like home!”\n- From the Annals of Ambrströnd\n\nPlains of snow, fields of ice and great forests of pine. One could be forgiven for believing themselves in the fjords of Gerudia were they wake ashore here, and yet this land is not our home. The Broken Sea it is called, for all the many islands scattered and cast about across its waters. Many of our scouts and explorers have reported finding strange and interesting relics and ruins strewn about the isles, as well as further inland. From the little we have gathered it seems the ancient elven folk once experimented with climate magics in the area - a knowledge that intrigues us greatly should it still exist. We shall explore the region and its surroundings in earnest, for we know that many things may lay preserved in ice."

 Z88_gerudian_golden_age_title: "Gerudian Golden Age"
 Z88_gerudian_golden_age_desc: "“The land did bloom and chill abate. Warm were the days then, and all did know plenty.”\n- From the Tale of Vaengheim\n\nGentle breezes and sunny days! Gerudia has not seen such a thaw since the end of the Era of Frost, when Elkaesal first fell to slumber and the ice melted away. Now it retreats again, and our summers see warmth like we have never known. Make no mistake, Gerudia is still no temperate paradise, but we would not wish her so. Merely that our ships may sail rivers free of ice, that our cities may climb tall, and our people may bask in the sun's bright glow."

 Z88_settling_the_frontier_title: "Settling the Frontier"
 Z88_settling_the_frontier_desc: "“The Giants name this land their home. I name this land their grave.”\n- Gjalund, from the Tale of Gjalund and the Giantslayers\n\nGerudia’s northern reach is a nigh endless expanse of tundra, with wood and snow and bog a plenty. It is a harsh and hostile land, yet one that yearns to be tamed. Sturdy trees provide excellent lumber, and the ample wildlife warm furs and rich meats. Danger lies there however, danger more real than even the harshest kiss of winter - for in the forest lurks the troll.\n\nWe cannot abide the threat they present to our settlers, and though they may be disorganised we may ensure at least some safety by seizing control of the largest tribe in the area. With the strongest of their number brought to heel it will be hard for the remaining trolls to pose a meaningful threat to our colonists, relegating them to small-scale attacks and raids more easily handled."

 Z88_oils_and_fat_title: "Oils and Fat"
 Z88_oils_and_fat_desc: "“But father, how shall we bear the cold in this frigid and pale north?”\n- Olav to Urvik - From the Tale of Olav and Urvik, the First Gerudians\n\nWhen, many centuries ago, we sought refuge from our scorched homes in the moors, it was north to snowy Gerudia we flew. Her frost sheltered us from the roost burners, who dared not follow across the seas, but so too did her cold bite. For frost and feather do not mix, and many a maiden has felt that terrible winter’s kiss upon their wing. But through hardship and suffering comes strength – we have adapted to the cold, and learnt ways to survive it.\n\nOils and fat are the key. Through coating our feathers in a liberal layer of these substances our people may brave even the harshest of winter winds. Our current produce is not nearly enough to maintain our current far-flung expeditions, however, and to continue to protect Gerudia we must seek out new sources of nature's warmth-giving bounty."

 Z88_settling_the_valley_title: "Settling the Valley"
 Z88_settling_the_valley_desc: "“And Olav and Urvik gazed across the fields and peaks, and saw a world of ice and snow and endless winter. And they saw therein the aspect of Elkaesal, in her beauty and her cruelty, and they would settle here, to be with her, despite the pain they endured from her rest.”\n- From the Tale of Olav and Urvik (As told by the Whitescale Kobolds)\n\nThe great valley north of our roost stretches right up to the base of the Black Frost Mountains, and is in many ways the core of Gerudia’s remaining wilderness. We have already funded and assisted many settling efforts in the region, and it has become dotted with small hamlets and frontier towns, settlements staking our claim to the region. Now it is time to invest in earnest in this endeavour, and turn the valley into a thriving heartland. As much as any Tundra may thrive, at least!"

 Z88_in_the_mountains_shadow_title: "The Mountains Shadow"
 Z88_in_the_mountains_shadow_desc: "“…For it is fair to die at sea, and sleep in waters deep. Worse yet is death below the earth, the soul entrapped in grip of stone, where no songs can be heard.”\n- From the dirge of the Deep, Stanza XII, the Song of Salt and Stone.\n\nDeep in the Black Frost Mountains is a mighty peak, one that towers above all around. From its steep, chiselled-like slopes the river Gullmyr springs, leading down to the lake below. Following the course of the river to its source, some of our explorers have made a most intriguing discovery. Half buried by fallen rock and coated in ice the outline of an ancient giant structure can be seen. The secrets within could be beyond imagining, and they must be ours, even if we must raise a roost around the mountain to dig them free!"

 Z88_the_wind_of_wanderlust_title: "Winds of Wanderlust"
 Z88_the_wind_of_wanderlust_desc: "“Upon those shores did they find boundless bounty, such unmatched across any elsewhere ocean”\n- The Tale of the Voyage of the North Raider\n\nA westward wind blows, and tales of a distant land filter into our ports. Aelantir it is named, ancient homeland of the elven folk. We have little interest of our own there, but many of our human kin owe their hearts to the sea, and feel the winds’ call in the drum of their hearts. We have much experience exploring by now, so let us cast out across the seas as the north raiders did! Perhaps Aelantir is the land of plenty they once found?"

 Z88_warm_in_the_winter_desc: "“Lay down your heavy head to rest, and fold your wings around you. And curl up snug upon your hoard, that winter’s bite will falter, upon your mail of shining scale, so that your dreaming heart may keep you warm and free from cold …”\n- Excerpt from the Old Winter Lullaby (Translation by Alra Lazyteeth)\n\nThe struggle to stay warm is one that every northerner knows well, for even in our summers the sun's light and warmth are meagre. Life in winter is even worse, for each day becomes a struggle simply to survive. The animals that make their homes here know this struggle well too, but they, unlike us, have adaptations for the climate. Thick fur coats and layers of fat insulate the mammals from the worst of the cold’s bite. Fortunately for us their solution can be ours too - we simply have to take their furs from them and wear them as our own."

 Z88_secrets_of_the_giants_desc: "“No word could tell the wonder that lays in that glade, treasure to giant or man”\n- From the Tale Treasure of The Golden Forest\n\nThe knowledge of the old elven folk has revealed things to us we didn’t, and couldn’t have expected. Armed with their lost techniques, our foremost skald-priests have theorised of a great project, an undertaking unlike any conceived of since the days of the ancients. Using our new tower in Sporreyn as a focal point it has been proposed to use the remaining giant towers to spread an enchantment across all Gerudia, a great lattice of magic to soften the climate and bring warmth to our hearts. It is an ambitious plan, but if we succeed we shall begin to usher in an age as never seen before."

Work yet remains however, for the glories of the present may always fade with time. No one lives forever in body, as even dragons may die, and the works they do upon the earth may wither and fade. Such is as it will be, but if the fate of Gerudia is a future of frost it shall not be for lack of our effort. All will remember what we did here in these days, and the song of it will soothe Elkaesal til the end of time."

vaengheim.1.t: "Monsters Like Us"
vaengheim.1.d: "The days of [GetYear] saw Vængheim at war, for queen [Root.Monarch.GetName] named all they saw as theirs, yet few would find their knees for them. And maidens many had their roost, with will to bring their knees to them, by spear if need be.\n\nYet Vængheim built her roost on war and mercy both. And those who found their knees did live, and were the better for it, for in defense they took them, to the bane of their foes.\n\nSo it was that Vængheim met the giant realm of Obrtrol, who sought to bring them an end. Yet Vængheim was to be their bane, for they had friends in Dalr, who had in years of bitter learning, found traps to fell the giants. And trolls did suffer mightily, for mannish wile and skybound maiden, was their doom together.\n\nThen a troll named Freydis Oaktongue, came to Vængheim, and she said\n\n“I speak not for all, for many seek you dead. And they see lands they had and lost. And they would take Gerudaghot, or take death for its want. And they will not be yours. But I have heard that you bring peace, and I would ask for such, for my clan and I know well your mannish friends, and ours is a cruel end, if no peace can be bought.”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] said\n\n“You speak true, for many here would gladly take your head. They know your gifts of chainbound wrist, but songs of peace are new to them. If now you sing to me of peace, the gift of peace I give you. For I am under oath of blood, and will not mute this song.”\n\nAnd though the hall did mutter, [Root.Monarch.GetName] bid Freydis find her knee."
vaengheim.1.a: "And Freydis found her knee, and her clan was better for it."
vaengheim.3.t: "Guardians"
vaengheim.3.d: "Then Vængheim spread her wings, and they who dwelled below her roost, were made hers by her maidens, who waged war on them with spear and song and wing, and brought their foes great shame, for none could stand against them.\n\nAnd many of the Olavish did find it odd that now, the daughters of the mountains came to them with spear and wrath. For they had near forgotten, the mountains to their back, who held for most old songs at best, and tales of ages past. And many lost their hearts, and thought that chains and bondage to them came, for Vængheim’s maidens held a cruel aspect to their eye.\n\nSo it was when [Root.Monarch.GetName] took wing, and flew from roost to coast, to meet the folk of Olavlund, who fought and bled to halt their flight, and the flight of their maidens. And the men of Olavlund found their knees in their sight, and said\n\n“Our song is that of the broken o queen, for well have you fought, and lost is our strength. Our people is yours, and we ask for pity's sake, that you find your heart and let us live.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] did say\n\n“Rise, o folk of Olavlund, and find your strength again, for you have fought with valour, and I would mend the wound I have bestowed upon your spirit. And I would have you raise your spear, and add your strength to mine, so that both our songs may grow, to shake the earth and sky.”\n\nThen were the folk of Olavlund struck dumb, for [Root.Monarch.GetName] had bit them with their song, and when they found their voice again, did they name them queen."
vaengheim.3.a: "And Vængheim and Olavlund both were better for it."
vaengheim.4.t: "Why Do We Sing?"
vaengheim.4.d: "In the days of [GetYear] the Dragon Coast fell under Vængheim's wings, and gentle was her shadow. The people of this rugged land, were gnomes and dragons both, yet not the dragons born of old, but smaller kin thereof, who stood to heights of gnomish peer, and held their ancestry most dear.\n\nYet with Vængheim came her skalds, who shared the tales of old, and gnomish mind is sharp and cold, and found no heart for song. Yet dragonkin took ear to these, and found them fair and soft, for many in their number held a love most deep for tale and song, to lull their brood to sleep.\n\nIt was then, that a dragonkin named Ikse Smallbristle, who named themself a dragonpriest, did ask a skald of Elkaesal, and she said\n\n“Soft is your tale and gentle your song, and odd I find her name. For I have heard this lullaby, and found that to my shame, it puts my little ones to sleep, and that seems ill to do, for Elkaesal should wake once more, so we may know her songs too.”\n\nAnd the skald, whose name was Frey, thought little ere he spoke\n\n“You speak the truth, and better this, that Elkaesal does sleep. For singing Alos' Lullaby, should keep her well asleep. For cruel are her songs, and she would bring us death. And send us winter without end, to choke life from our breast. So fear not for your little ones, for songs as these give gentle dreams. And unlike the great white beast of old, they will find their eyes come morning.”\n\n“...Right?”\n\nAnd Frey did look askance at Ikse, who stood as if struck dumb. Silently she turned and left, in haste hereto unseen."
vaengheim.4.a: "Uh-oh…"
vaengheim.5.t: "Wake the Dragon!"
vaengheim.5.d: "And the dragonkin did rise, for a thousand little voices become a roar when sung together. And they made a mighty noise, to wake Elkaesal from her slumber, to call her name, and save her from the dark."
vaengheim.5.a: "**WAKE HER UP!**"
vaengheim.6.t: "Take Flight"
vaengheim.6.d: "It was in the days of [GetYear], when [Root.Monarch.GetName] was queen in Vængheim. Their reign had been a peaceful one, for few men dared the mountains brave, to bring war to their hall. In this they held a mighty gift, one shared by few, yet sought by many. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew this, and found it fair.\n\nYet one day did the fate see fit, to bring a man to them. His hair was wild, and from his mane, a single eye beheld her. With single arm, the cliffs he braved, to reach their roost and speak to then. And he said.\n\n“O queen, I come to you as friend, and tell you thus. The time of Vængheim ends, in days and years to come. For faintly gutters fires here, who once were bright and fierce. Bold wings were your kin bestowed, yet here you sit to roost. And on your mountain you will stay forgotten, till none can surely say, where the maidens of Vængheim went, and when your hall fell silent.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] took this ill, for his words bit their pride. They bid their maidens banish him, and they did so. Yet his words had struck them, and like a wound that would not heal did they eat at them, until they called their maidens to them, and said\n\n“I would ask a boon of you, who bound your lives to mine. For many years together, our vigil have we kept. And as our charge below has slept, have we dreamt in our turn. Of ages past and glories gone, and blood that now runs cold and slow. And this I cannot bear.”\n\n“So come, my sisters and recall, the glories old that took us here. Take up your spear and mail again, for Vængheim wakes once more. Take wing and spy what lies beneath our hall. For I would bring my law to these, to benefit us all.”"
vaengheim.6.a: "And the maidens of Vængheim took wing."

vaengheim.7.t: "Heavenly Wing"
vaengheim.7.d: "Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] set their gaze to the east, and found a foe in Urviksten. Their host did fly, to strike at them, for they were known for skill in war. Yet much akin to Vængheim's roost, did Urviksten herself, keep warm with tales from ages past, and dreams of ebon frost. By wing and spear, and mannish hand, did Vængheim bring her host to battle, and found a foe most fierce. And though she won the field that day, it was but one of many smaller wars then fought, in cliff and gorge, on hill and barrow, for Urviksten had many folk who chose to die in place, for they found battle fair, and would not fly from her.\n\nThen came [Root.Monarch.GetName] to Urviksten, and the steward of the great forge could scarce believe their eyes, for many who they had thought dead, were with the host of Vængheim, and though much worse for wear, they had been set to mend, and would see battles more. Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say\n\n“Proud folk of Urviksten! Well have you fought and great is your glory. But war alone grows bitter, for they who take the spear, abandon plow and net. I would give you peace this day, and give your children to you! For winter comes to Olavlund, and it is warm beneath my wing. Join the host of Vængheim, and I will give you glory, greater than you would reap in holding to your homestead.”\n\nSilent were the walls of Urviksten, save shifting spears, furtive glance, the voiceless song of dancing thought neath knotted brow."
vaengheim.7.a: "And then her gates swung open…"

vaengheim.8.t: "All Gerudian Council"
vaengheim.8.d: "Vængheim then knew days of plenty, for she had found her heart, and spread her wings to shield the folk who lived beneath her roost. For in scant years her sleeping hall, had woken to the song, of maidens more than seen before, for roosts aplenty had been wrought across the peaks of Titan's Rest.\n\nThis would be well alone, but Vængheims hall had grown, with Olavish and Dalr, who mannish tales did tell, and many songs they sang, together with their hosts, who found their voices fair. Some maidens felt a sting to pride, as wingless folk their hall did tread, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw their ire, and called them to their side, and the wingless folk of Gerudia as well. And then they said\n\n“Hark now, my sisters and brothers, for in this hall you stand together. Long dreaming was this roost, and in her waking have you all found war and glory and bloody death, the latest to my sorrow. But this was done for greater cause, for we are strong together. To my sisters do I pledge, that this roost and your own, shall always have a voice to sing in sight of Vængheim's throne. And to the men of Olavlund, and Dalr, who were bested, take heart, for you have fought with pride, and in this war been tested. You as well shall have a voice, and mine blood shall take heed, so says the blood of Krjá Kjórvé, and this be my vow, that your people be our people, from this day, until our last day.”"
vaengheim.8.a: "It is said, it shall be."

vaengheim.9.t: "The Winds of Winter"
vaengheim.9.d: "Vængheim then knew peace, and for a time her roost brought warmth and comfort to the folk of Gerudia. And some began to say, that the hall of [Root.Monarch.GetName] which had so wrothfully woken, now fell back to rest, to keep a vigil of their charge, and let their people forget them in turn.\n\nThen in the days of [GetYear] did a mighty storm engulf her. And snow did fall in clouds and heaps, and painted white the peaks, and winds of power tore the roof from Vængheim's hall, and threw it to the Giant's Grave, to sail then and today. And mannish skalds from Olavlund, and maidens of the roost, did put their heads together, and whisper songs of dreaming thought and knotted brow, and knew, that this was unlike aught that they had seen in life of man or maiden.\n\nThen shook the earth, the mountain shrugged, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] had cause to praise their roof for flying free, for the walls of their hall did tumble mightily, and crushed would they have been, had not the roof found wing.\n\nThen did their skalds address them thus\n\n“O queen, an omen ill we sing, for known to you is this. The dragon stirs, and shifts beneath your hall and sets your roost aquiver. She wakes.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] blanched, for they knew, and said also\n\n“She wakes.”\n\nAnd though they thought their songs sung in secret, the hall was without roof, and thus the storm did steal their voice, and let it fall across their realm. And every ear did listen, and every heart found fear that day."
vaengheim.9.a: "She Wakes."

vaengheim.10.t: "The Broken Cycle"
vaengheim.10.d: "Darker then became the days, and some began to think, that winter clouds flew down from north, and brought the sun to flight. And summers caught the bite of cold, and many did huddle under Vængheim's wing, for ill-seen were these omens. Yet Vængheim's roost was warm, with fire, feast and bodies. A roof anew was mounted, and eagerly did the maidens of [Root.Monarch.GetName] stalk the halls, and chase away the chill. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not see fit to roost and dream, in fleeting warmth and dying summer. And so they called her skalds to their side, and said\n\n“All of you were here that day, when roost was shook, and roof took flight, and snow fell down to sleep here. Something is amiss, and it sets my wings aquiver. So go out now, and find me what could pry my charge from rest, and know that you go with my word, and bear my roost upon you. For if the white one deep below, sees fit to wake in earnest...”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] said no more. But, one of their wingmaidens, a clever bird named Iona, did speak out of turn, and said\n\n“Far have I flown in my time, and I tell you thus. This bane comes from the Reach, for evil voices whisper there. and baneful words take wing from there, and they wish ill upon your house, for your rise is their fall.”\n\nAnd though no one spoke, it was not for lack of hearing. All ears did listen, and many wings took flight that day, and many boats set sail that day, and all eyes turned south, to the Alen, and the Reach."
vaengheim.10.a: "“And unkind eyes did find the Reachmen, and the Reachmen found their swords..”"

vaengheim.11.t: "The Epic of Asfrid"
vaengheim.11.d: "It was in the days of [GetYear], when [Root.Monarch.GetName] was queen in Vængheim. And to their roost flew a rare crow. For they were Asfrid Ebonwing, who it was said was wrought from eastern orcish folk, who were the bane of dwarves.\n\nAnd Asfrid bore a clever mind, and it was said in jest, that they was hatched with tongue asleep, and could rouse it only for asking the way of things. And Asfrid was dear to Vængheim, for all who dwelt within, found that Asfrid sought to know them, and learn from them.\n\nAs Asfrid came of age, they took to war as fish to sea. And they would know the craft of duel, the art of battle, the toil of tactics. Yet Asfrid found fair the wingless folk, and unlike their peers, would they march with them, and bear the queen's banner with them, and would take to battle with them where the fighting was fiercest.\n\nAsfrid found war a cruel craft, and their wings were torn by shot and fire. Oft than not, their peers would find Asfrid fallen on the field of glory with mannish friend, their blood mingled in the mud. And they found it foul, for it stung their pride to see a sister thus.\n\nAsfrid was not blind to this, and hatched a plan. With blacksmith's aid they took to forge, and wrought a mail of ebonsteel, and Asfrid’s sisters found it foul, and scorned them, and asked in cruel jest, how they would fly with such a plate. And Asfrid said\n\n“Look upon my wings, black were their feathers, now black is their flesh, for war has found them. I will not fly, for war is won on the field. So to the field I shall go.”\n\nAnd though Asfrid won little love from their sisters, they won many mannish friends, who found her ways fair. And young maidens saw this, and would take to Asfrid’s craft, and in this aspect they would take to war in heavy plate."
vaengheim.11.a: "And soon the foes of Vængheim, would grow to rue the Ebonwings."

vaengheim.12.t: "Unto Elkaesal"
vaengheim.12.d: "The days hence Welyam’s end bore a grim aspect, for the summers grew short, and the wings of winter grew vast, bringing snow to days, that in years past had been free of their shadow. Even the sun turned from the earth, their face obscured behind a veil of clouds as if in mourning. Harvest after harvest did winter claim, and with the cold came the hunger. And many did say that these were the final days.\n\nIt was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who was queen then, and they shared the plight of their people. As they suffered did [Root.Monarch.GetName] open the coffers of her roost, and spread far their wealth, to lessen winter’s blows. One day their roost shook, as if the very mountain on which Vængheim nested, had caught a mortal chill. [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose, and said\n\n“Elkaesal shifts and soon will she wake, for her dreams are dark. Vengeance would I swear on Gaweton, for her sons have brough doom to both our peoples. And yet, though vengeance sings in my ear, it is a song I know too well. And it is the song that doomed Welyam, and would doom us in our turn.”\n\n“I go instead to Elkaesal, and I will sing to her, and soothe her and bring her peace. For hag-magic has ensnared her dreams, and she will not shake this curse alone. Let it be known that all who would, may join me on this hunt.”\n\nAnd many did, for they knew that to do nothing, was to die. Men, and trolls and orcs, and dragonkin, gnomes and elves of the old west. All took cause with [Root.Monarch.GetName], and together walked beneath Vængheim. And many who saw them did weep, for they saw the dead walking to their doom."
vaengheim.12.a: "Hark now! A cold grave awaits us."

vaengheim.13.t: "Frigid and Freezing"
vaengheim.13.d: "Long did they travel in the old caves below Vængheim, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] took heart, for they were not alone. A great gate did they come upon, shut and shuttered. And long did the trolls, who were strongest in the host, toil in prying ice from wood and steel. Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] approach the lock, and from their mail-shirt a key offer, for many duties were given unto the maidens of Vængheim, but greatest was the duty of the queen of the roost, to keep this door sealed. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] said\n\n“I feel the eyes of many mothers upon me now, to open this door, who they kept shut. Yet this thing I must do, for Elkaesal will be our bane, so that none will live to sing of my dishonour.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened the great door. And from behind it did blow a wind of ice, cold as to burn like fire. And many in their host suffered greatly, for the chill struck them and stole their breath. And some wished to turn back, for the cold had pierced their hearts, and brought to them fear of a bitter end. [Root.Monarch.GetName] said, though their teeth did chatter\n\n“If the cold has taken your hearts, know that it tugs at mine as well! Those of you who would turn from this toil, do not walk in shame, yet go to my hall, and bring word of our plight...”"
vaengheim.13.a: "“Many furs shall we need, and they who fear no cold shall wield them!”"
vaengheim.13.b: "“Open our stocks! Bring furs and fire - They who take to this toil need fear no cold!”"

vaengheim.14.t: "Footsteps in Frost"
vaengheim.14.d: "Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] enter Elkaesal's lair, and they made good speed, though the cold bit at them, and made a cruel battle of each breath stolen from the air. Then did the host come upon a track. Footsteps in the ice, left by mannish boot. [Root.Monarch.GetName] spoke, though the cold strangled their words\n\n“This is an ill omen, for this place was shut for many days, and no living man may walk here. Today I have failed in my duty, and I am bereaved, for I know not how.”\n\nThen did the orc Adûl Half-tongue, a brave man from Bal Vroren say\n\n“Living or dead makes no matter, for our toil is to reach the dreamer. If they make cause against us, we will slay them, yet here we cannot linger, for this cold will be our bane.”\n\nAnd many in the host did agree, for Adûl spoke true. Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say..."
vaengheim.14.a: "“Have a care, for if our failure bring foemen to this place, we must be ready.”"
vaengheim.14.b: "“Your words are true, and whoever came to this place may share our cause. Onwards!”"

vaengheim.15.t: "Frozen-Fall"
vaengheim.15.d: "Then did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] come upon a great cavern, and all were struck by its splendour, for each and every surface was clad in mail of glittering ice. From some distant place did the sun shine upon it, and their rays were by the ice ensnared and brought to this place far below the earth. And in the ice did one spy any hue the eye could see or the mind could dream of, and in the gloom did the light remind those who saw it, of the warmth of distant summer, and the daylight far above. And some were taken by longing, though their tears froze on their cheeks.\n\nAnd in the center of this place there was a vast pit, leading to unseen places far below. And a waterfall, turned to shining ice, did plunge boldly into it, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to their host and said\n\n“Alone must we wingmaidens go, for we have little time to give. Return to the day with your heads held high, and know that you did what you could.”\n\nAnd some did turn to go, but one of the Dragonkin, whose name was Alra Lazyteeth, did raise her voice\n\n“Go o queen, but know that we follow. For whether man, orc, troll or other, our minds are not yet so cold, that we cannot find a way into this pit. We will come to you when we can, for by pick and skilled carver, shall we forge a path that the wingless may walk.”\n\nAnd those who had turned, now turned again, their faces set in resolve. As their host set to their toil did [Root.Monarch.GetName] see them, and their heart was warmed, for these were their people. Then they took wing."
vaengheim.15.a: "“Wingmaidens, to me!”"

vaengheim.16.t: "Bellowing Breaths"
vaengheim.16.d: "Soon after did the wingmaidens of [Root.Monarch.GetName] draw near to Alkaesal's resting place, and the cold grew bitter, and in flight did it strike at their wings and their senses. And as their quarry grew near did some lose flight, tumbling to the ground, where they lay unmoving. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] cursed the name of Welyam, not for the first time.\n\nYet by flight did they reach a hollow, where the cold did not bite so fiercely. And with their strongest wingmaidens did they now hear a mighty roar, not far ahead. And Iona Gunnarsdottir, who was one of the queen's strongest did say\n\n“The cold take my ears, for this is no roar. The beast snores like my mother's mother, and not half as loud.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] took heart, yet not all did, and some Wingmaidens, battered by the cold, felt fear grip their hearts, and they..."
vaengheim.16.a: "Broke and fled, to their shame and their doom."
vaengheim.16.b: "Knew that the daughters of Vængheim stood together or not at all. So they stood."

vaengheim.17.t: "It is a Good Day to Die!"
vaengheim.17.d: "Now did the host of Vængheim come to Elkaesal, and they beheld her glory, for in her vastness did she fill the cavern, coated in ice and snow, like a vast blanket for a dreaming child. Her claws, flexing in unrest, were tall as a troll, and her visage so great that [Root.Monarch.GetName] held no doubt that she could devour a Vængheim roost in one bite, should she have a mind to do so. And those skilled in the art of song did see that the foul craft of Granny Kraka, nipped at her mind, and with blood and torment sought to tear her from sleep. And their hearts sank, for they knew that they had only moments to act.\n\nYet, there in front of Elkaesal, stood the one armed Skald, and he was singing, though his voice was small and brittle. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] felt the cold like a living thing, biting at their flesh. They made to approach, but a voice rang out behind them.\n\n“You are not alone. We go together!”\n\nAnd they saw their people, who had followed them. Few were left, and all were bitten by cold. But they were here, and together did they make for the Skald, whose song began to waver.\n\nAnd they began to sing, voices aquiver, from lungs that burned from killing cold, yet given hearts that burned warmer still. And as the song of Alos died, the song of Vængheim rose to life. And Elkaesal heard the old songs, and the new songs sung together, and the hag-magic of Aldtempel which tormented her, found now a greater foe. And it was struck mightily, and was unwound, and Elkaesal knew peace.\n\nAnd the skald found his voice again, and as his song grew in strength, did the host of Vængheim fall silent, for they had given all in their toil, and knew that they had bought the world with their lives."
vaengheim.17.a: "And theirs was a good death."

vaengheim.171.t: "Dreams of Summer"
vaengheim.171.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knew darkness then, but light returned to them, and they found sight, and their wits found them, and they awoke, not in the house of the dead, but in their own hall, abed and in the grip of the dull pain of those who fought the cold and lived. Then the one-armed skald came to them, for he had heard of their wakening, and he said\n\n“Yours is a curious house, o queen. And the songs of your people stranger still. For my sister would have woken, and in her wrath ended me. And I did not think to find friends there, in the deep places of the earth.”\n\n“I have done what I can for your host, and where my songs were found wanting, have I shared with your house what I know of mundane mending. We may meet again, for I have seen your house and found it fair.”\n\nThen the skald left, and Vængheim fell silent for some time, for many had been taken by the cold, and many hearths were struck dumb by their absence. Yet they who lived did in time recover, and they were honoured by kith and kin. And with the coming of spring did the hall of [Root.Monarch.GetName] awaken, and shake from her mighty shoulders the chill of winter. And as the days grew long, did the people of Vængheim rejoice, and they drank from the warmth of the sun, as those dying of thirst would from the river.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] took the name “the Wingless”, for the ice had bitten their wings deeply, and they would never fly again. Yet their reign was a blessed one, and they were dear to her people, who saw an earthbound monarch, and found them fair."
vaengheim.171.a: "And many songs were sung of “The Wingmaiden Wingless”."

vaengheim.18.t: "The Tale of Vaengheim"
vaengheim.18.d: "As Elkaesal found gentle dreams, did Vaengheim find her peace, and summer found Gerudia. By clever crafts of ancient world, and new songs sung by voices legion, did warmer days, and gentle rains, and harvests rich come to the realm that roosted 'neath Vængheim's wing. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] who was queen in those days, did send forth their maidens, not as heralds of war, but as envoys of peace. And they did visit every roost, and every homestead, and flew beyond Vængheim’s domain, to realms of other folk, and spoke of a great feast, to which all who wished to partake was welcome. For in the words of the queen, all were guests under their roof.\n\nAnd on that day did the mighty gates of Vængheim swing open, and for the first time did they stay open, for there was no need to shut out the winter. Warm were the days then, and for seven days and seven nights, were celebrations held, and sung were mighty songs, who it was said in jest, might wake the dragon 'neath the mountain, to in the feast partake.\n\nMany friends were made then, and in that summer, and many summers hence, did winter lose her grip on Gerudia, and the warmth of summer found cold hearts, and thawed them, and thus did the realm prosper. It was a bitter time for those who came after, for many born in ages hence, be they mannish or maiden, would hear songs of this age, and 'neath knotted brow would groan and grumble, and say\n\n“Would that I had lived in those days.”"
vaengheim.18.a: "So ends the tale of Vaengheim."

vaengheim.19.t: "The Gerudian Thaw"
vaengheim.19.d: "In the days of [GetYear] did trollish toil conclude, and queen [Root.Monarch.GetName] was asked to Sporreyn come, to see the craft of Oaktongue clan, who had raised the tower in Aldis' stead. And they saw a mighty thing, for the tower had been made of stone entire, like the giant's craft in Gullmork. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked the chief Asgeir\n\n“Will this place not fall to dust, bereft of wood or mortar, to hold it strong against the wind and sea?”\n\nAnd Asgeir answered\n\n“Shame bring I to you, to speak your tongue, for I am no lord thereof. Tower tall will stand, for troll is child to giant, and their craft is our craft. This tower needs no wood, for held it is by strength of earth. Stone alone will sing here, for mighty song to weave. We sought Gerudaghot alone, yet under wing of yours have we found it. Your people love us not, but they will see our craft this day, and know our gift. Trust, o queen, I ask you thus, fly high, and put rest the last stone. For you will see our gift as well, and it will linger until the mountains fall.” \n\nThen Asgeir gave [Root.Monarch.GetName] a small stone cube. And they took wing, and flew atop Oaktongue tower, and found there the rest of this final stone. And as they put it in place, did Asgeir's folk loose ropes, and scaffolding remove. And the tower stood, each stone holding the next, to stand together until the end of time. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] felt the hum of ancient magic, and saw the clouds swirl, and gently alter course."
vaengheim.19.a: "And for the first time a warm wind blew from the north."

vaengheim.20.t: "Of Harpy and Kobold"
vaengheim.20.d: "Scaled figures huddle close around their nest, listening intently to the sounds of cracking. Before them, an egg nears its hatching. They are eager to help, to free the child from its shell, but they know that the first breach must be made by the child.\n\nWhen finally the shell cracks, a murmur of chittering excitement passes amidst the kobolds. A pinkish, fleshy, and stubby little hand pushes away at the shell and the sound of a baby's cry can be heard. Claws of many different colors greet the hand, pinching delicately at the now cracked shell and pulling it open to extract the newborn.\n\nIt’s a girl.\n\nIt’s a harpy.\n\nWhen her mother perished in a heroic battle against a Roc, it was a trivu of kobolds who had offered to care for the orphaned egg. She would be family, as any other egg hatched from the trivus nursery. A talon in two worlds, she would learn clever tricks and traps from her kobold siblings and in turn she would help teach the more sorcerously inclined among them to fly.\n\nSuch stories are common now, within the roosts of the Dragon Coast. As kobolds are welcomed within the homes of harpies, harpies are welcomed within the families of kobolds. Glittering hoards decorate the highest peaks, displayed proudly to any fliers above, while kobold traps protect roosts as fiercely as they might their own home. For, after all, many kobolds now call these roosts home."
vaengheim.20.a: "The Fruit of Co-existence"

vaengheim.21.t: "Martial Lives"
vaengheim.21.d: "Now blessed days did Vængheim find, for war became her art, and mighty grew her folk in pursuit thereof. For whether man or orc or elf, her wingless flocks took field, and fear held no grip on their hearts, for they knew the sky had eyes on them, and saw their cause and found it fair. And many foes were routed thus, to battle brought, from sky unwrought, for wingmaiden struck relentless, at flank and rear and cannon, and mannish friends had they, who shared the arts of pike and shot. In such a way was glory found, and those who fell in Vængheim's name, knew glory in death, or honour in life, for the maidens of Vængheim would scour the field, of those in glory vanquished, and find they whom still ensouled, they could yet pry from deathly grip. And skilled were they in mending crafts, and many men were brought, from dead, to life anew. For the daughters of Vængheim took them, and flew them to their roost, where they brought them to rest, their wounds to mend, the embers of their hearts rekindled, to glory find anew.\n\nAnd many roosts grew strong thus, for failure is the greatest teacher, and snatched from death did these folk pass on, great knowledge of their craft. And armed and trained, and better schooled, they stepped from peaks to war again, for Vængheim's glory and their own to win."
vaengheim.21.a: "And to the ruin of their foes."

vaengheim.101.t: "The Call Of The Hunt"
vaengheim.101.d.hag: "It was in the days of [GetYear], that the bheur-hag Granny Kraka struck Gerudia with a great host of trolls. With rite and ritual did she lend her host wicked cunning and cruel wit, for Granny Kraka was versed in evil songs. Many did Kraka slay in battle, and blood and fire was offered to the people of Gerudia.\n\nThe queen in those days was [Root.Monarch.GetName], who made ready for war in Vængheim. And many Skalds were in their service. One night, a lone troll came to [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s hall, and he said\n\n“I bear the tongue of Granny Kraka, and I ask you this. I burn your lands and slay your people. I take from you all things you defend. I call you a weakling and a craven. What say you?”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose and said\n\n“I say thusly. You are a guest under my roof. Your mother gives insult, for she seeks to bait me. Know that I will not shed your blood in my hall, and know that your evil songs are best sung to the open sky.”\n\nThen did four strong wingmaidens seize the troll. They flew him off the mountain and gave him to the sky, and he struck the ground mightily and was slain.\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.enter: "The words of Cassan were not forgotten, and it was in the days of [GetYear] that [Root.Monarch.GetName] made war upon their enemy, who named themselves Equilibrists, and who did strike at them. and they took to the field in robes of white, yet did beneath wear black mail of black iron, and they did wield weapons with skill, plucking wingmaidens from the sky with fire and arquebus.\n\nBattle raged thusly for long days, and bonds of friendship were rekindled betwixt reachman and gerudian. For many fighting folk of Olavlund and Dalr did serve under the wings of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and to the reachmen they came not as foemen, but as saviours, for the Equilibrists were bitter foes, and would salt the earth ere their foes could claim it. Thus many of their kin were brought to Vængheim's banner, for their hearts grew fond of [Root.Monarch.GetName] as they saw the cruel ways of their kin.\n\nThus did the Equilibrists falter with time, for the reachmen knew their ways and their traps, and inch by inch, day by day, did the Equilibrists lose their grip on the Reach. It was in these days, that Godric and Cassan, who had found one another, came to the hall of [Root.Monarch.GetName] once more, and they did say\n\n“O queen. Together have we spoken, and we have walked our lands, and felt ash rain upon our faces, and many tears have we wept. But the Equilibrists know us not, and we have spoken with them, and we have heard their plans. They gather now in Aldtempel, where all gods bear witness, and they seek to strike at you with all the might they have left.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] did rise, and they gathered Reachman, Dalr, Olavlunder and Wingmaiden all, for war."
vaengheim.101.d.end: "In the wake of the war for Aldtempel did the queen of Vængheim decree, that it be made pure again. For the Equilibrists had offered the blood of those ingloriously slain upon the old stones, and it was hateful to the Gods. And for many did the reachmen toil, but so too did skalds from Dalr and Olavlund, and they did work tirelessly, shoulder to shoulder with Orcs from Giantsmarch and Northern troll, who knew well the wicked magic of the hags. Working as one did they make mighty strides, yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew well that they would not see the Temple made whole in their lifetime, nor the lifetime of their daughters. Yet they did not weep, for they knew the worth of their toil.\n\nIt was in the days of [GetYear] that Godric and Cassan came to [Root.Monarch.GetName] at Aldtempel. And they said\n\n“O queen. We have walked along the Alen, from old Vertesk to Bal Mire. Little have we said, but much have we heard. The Equilibrists are dead, and they who gave them swords to strike at you, are struck dumb in their turn. Yet do they work against you mutely, spinning their webs like spiders. Theirs is a world without song, and they nest in the queen of the Alen, in great Gaweton.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] did say\n\n“Then Gaweton is where we must go. For these men would doom the world to strike at me, and their webs must be unwound. Many grudges would I settle with these men, for they are without honour.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for an odd hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.nacker: "And so it was in [GetYear] that Nackers arose in the bogs and mires of fair Gerudia. And they did descend upon the cities of men in their thousands, and they stole, and they killed, and they drank, and they broke the Queen’s peace.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] was queen in those days. A fisher named Þórdís came to them in Vængheim, and she said\n\n“[Root.Monarch.GetName], my village is full of nackers. For every step I take, I find two nackers underfoot. They eat all the fish, and worst of all, they have stolen my son and put a nacker in his place.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] rose, and said\n\n“The nackers have broken my peace and bled my people. And so have they bled me. In stealing your son, they have stolen my son. I will fly out with you, and I will help you take back our son, or avenge our son.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.roc: "It was in the days of [GetYear], when [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the queen of Vængheim. Skilled in war and peace, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a blessing to their people, and when the great Roc Blåfjöður came to their realm from the east, did the people mutter that this was an omen of change.\n\nYet Blåfjöður was a cruel guest, and soon did the men of Dalr and Alen find common cause against him. For Blåfjöður was greedy, and would steal away cows, sheep, horses and wagons all, drawing them into the sky to be devoured. When word of Blåfjöðurs greed came to the hall of [Root.Monarch.GetName], they rose hastily and said\n\n“Blåfjöður has brought shame to my hall, for he steals from my people, worse yet does he come from the sky, to which I claim dominion. Thus I am challenged, and I will answer in kind.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.skald: "It was in the days of [GetYear] when Vængheim spread her wings wide and embraced many nations. Whether mannish, trollish, orcish or other, thousands did find home under the shadow of her maidens, and the days were long and blessed, for each saw honour in the other, and the many peoples of Vængheim did care for the realm, and they nurtured it and made it bountiful. The queen in those days were [Root.Monarch.GetName], and their reign was a good one.\n\nYet did shadows come to their hall, for [Root.Monarch.GetName] held true to the old songs, and one of their peoples were unnerved by them, for the old songs brought them great pain.\n\nThese were the dragonkin who were named Kobolds, and when they heard the song of Elkaesal did they put their paws to their head and scream mightily.\n\n“Cruel are these songs, for Elkaesal is our mother, and she has been called to a sleep from which she may not wake! We must awaken her, for one who sleeps cannot sing, and the world must hear the song of Elkaesal!”\n\nThis could have gone poorly, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] was endowed with a clever tongue, and they said\n\n“Peace, little dragon, for you speak true. The song you have heard is old. As your queen, I ask you for time. Let me find a skald who can sing the song in a manner you find fair, for I see that this song pains you, and so does it pain me, for you are my people.”\n\nAnd the dragonkin did lay down their arms in honour of this promise, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] did, with great urgency, gather the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.woo: "And so it was in [GetYear] that the great white wolf Hati awoke from her long sleep in far Gerudia. And with her wretched brood did she descend upon the fields of men, and stained the snow with their blood.\n\nThe queen in those days was [Root.Monarch.GetName], who heard of Hati from Gudrún the blacksmith, whose husband and children Hati had devoured. Gudrún had sworn her vengeance on Hati, and asked [Root.Monarch.GetName] to share her cause.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] said to Gudrún.\n\n“Your cause is my cause. Your spear is my spear. You go to battle, and I fly with you. For slaying my people and spilling their blood upon the snow, I will take Hati’s pelt, but her heart is yours, for yours is the heart she has broken.”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] rallied the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.tt: "And so it was in the days of [GetYear], that the troll named Jordis Frog-Catcher did come to the cities of Gerudia, demanding gold and flesh in tribute. And Jordis did slay and eat any man who refused her. A furrier named Gunnar ran to Vængheim, and he did beseech [Root.Monarch.GetName] to save his home from Jordis and her greed.\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose and said.\n\n“Jordis has slain my people and stolen from them. And so she has stolen from me. I will fly to Jordis, and she will pay me weregeld, or she will die.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.ff: "It was in the days of [GetYear], when [Root.Monarch.GetName] was queen of Vængheim. A man named Kåre, who was blessed with fertile land and many flocks, did come to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. And he said\n\n“O queen, I kneel before you, for there is nowhere else I can turn. The old man of the forest has taken my son Asbjörn, and I am left bereaved. I beg of you save my son from this wicked spirit!”\n\nAnd then he wept. [Root.Monarch.GetName], who knew something of the fey, said\n\n“I know of whom you speak. A woldwight is he, of great power and cunning. But why has he taken your son?”\n\nAnd Kåre, whose tears were without number, answered\n\n“He seeks to take that which is most precious to me, for he knows that bereft of this, the taste of life will be as ash upon my tongue, for he covets my wealth and my land, and seeks my ruin.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] did rise, and said\n\n“Weep no more, for I shall make your cause my cause. For the sake of your son, I will brave the wight, and see that justice is done.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.ww: "It was in the days of [GetYear], when a man named Geir, who was a hunter, was afflicted with a curse. And he did shed his skin for that of a great bear, and he did hunt the men of his hometown, and he did devour their flesh under the glare of the moon, making him twice-cursed in the eyes of the gods.\n\nThe queen in those dark days was [Root.Monarch.GetName]. And one night Geir came to their hall, and he said\n\n“My queen, I have two souls, the soul of a man who wants to die, and the soul of a beast who wants to kill. I invite you to holmgång.”\n\nThen Geir shed his skin, and slew many of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s maidens. Many spears and arrows found him, but they broke on his pelt like ice on steel. Thus was Geir given the name Ironpelt. [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose and said\n\n“You who I call Ironpelt, have slain my sisters in my hall, and soaked the stones of Vængheim with their blood. I will go to holmgång with you, but know that your deeds are unworthy, and that the maidens of Vængheim hunt you now for vengeance, not for glory.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vaengheim for a great hunt."
vaengheim.101.d.db: "It was in the days of [GetYear] when [Root.Monarch.GetName] was queen, and their maidens did strike forth across the Giant’s Grave, and brought fire and sword to the Reach, making subjects of those who bent knee to Vængheim, and slaying those who did not.\n\nYet did the men of the Alen resist them, first in battle, and then in spirit. For [Root.Monarch.GetName] was not loved by the reach, and they plotted against them, and sought their ruin.\n\nOne day did a wingmaiden fly to Vængheim, and in their claws held a man named Godric, who said\n\n“O queen, foul tidings do I bring. For I am a Reachman, and have pledged myself to your house. Yet do my kinsmen strike at me, and they have burned my home and taken from me herd, kith and kin. I come alone, but I speak with the tongues of many, who speak your name fondly, though they are shamed and slain by their neighbours.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] rise, and said\n\n“Have no fear Reachman, for when I took your people under my wing, I did not take them into thralldom. Your people are my people, and I will take arms to defend those who carry my peace in their hearts.”\n\nAnd then [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the maidens of Vængheim for war."
vaengheim.101.d.md: "It was in the days of [GetYear], when [Root.Monarch.GetName] was queen. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] did gather the people of Gerudia beneath their wings, and made them theirs. And whether mannish, trollish or orcish did many find their knees before Vængheim, and they were better for it.\n\nOne day did a troll named Freydis Oaktongue come to Vængheim. And she knelt before [Root.Monarch.GetName] and said\n\n“O queen, I come to you from the forests of Digoveda, where your name is spoken fondly. And we sing songs of our forefathers there, who ruled this land long ago. And I would gather a host, and to Gullmork wander, there to bore into the bones of the earth. For I know that there lies the house of my fathers and mothers, and of they who gave my people breath and purpose. And I would see this place with mine own eyes, and I invite you to share in the bounty of my toils, if you will lend me the strength of your house.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] rise and say\n\n“Well do you speak, o daughter of giants, and your name is well chosen, for your tongue is wise like the oak. Mine own strength will you have, and the strength of any in this hall who seeks the bounty you offer. For we know less of your people than we should, and the gift you give is a rare thing.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] call upon those in their house who sought to know of the world that was, and many skalds did they count in their host. And they set out for Gullmork, with hearts and minds ablaze with the flame of knowledge."
vaengheim.101.d.pr: "Now did [Root.Monarch.GetName] return to Vængheim, and left Freydis Oaktongue and her people in the house of her forefathers. And for many days there was silence. Yet in the days of [GetYear] did Freydis return to Vængheim in great haste, and many heads did she turn, and the hall fell silent, for all knew that when Freydis spoke, it was wise to listen.\n\nAnd Freydis took knee before [Root.Monarch.GetName] and said\n\n“O queen, I return with songs that will ruffle your feathers. For I have read the stones of Gullmork tower, and I have spoken with my kin and yours, and many maps of the west, old and new, have I gazed upon. I say to you this. There is a place in Aelantir that I have found, that holds the key to Gullmork tower. If it be made mine, I will make yours the craft of my forefathers.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose and said\n\n“It is a mighty promise you offer. Were you another, I would laugh at your jest. Yet I hear your words and call them true. Aelantir is too far to fly, so we must sail. What say you to this?”\n\nAnd Freydis bowed her head and said\n\n“My people know the price you name and call it too dear. For they fear naught but the Giant's Grave, where our forefathers lie drowned, and the waves grow tall, and water deep. I will come with you, though this bane puts my heart to fright.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] call upon those in their house who sought to know of the world that was, and once more did many skalds hear their call and find it worthy. And a fleet was mustered at the port of Sporreyn, to brave the Lament and meet the sunset."

vaengheim.120.d: "Then the maidens of Vængheim took to the sky, and their keen gaze fell upon their dominion. Yet the hunt grew long, and wings grew weary from days in flight. Many looked to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for guidance, for their hearts were heavy, and the fear of failure shone in their eyes. [Root.Monarch.GetName] fell silent, their head bowed. Then they looked to the sky, and said"
vaengheim.120.a: "“I am the blood of Krjá Kjórvé, neither man, nor beast can elude me!”"
vaengheim.120.b: "“...Find me a hunter of this land. We need not hunt alone.”"

vaengheim.121.t: "Dalliance and Distraction"
vaengheim.121.d: "And so did one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s wingmaidens meet a man on the hunt, who was himself a hunter, and who was skilled with bow and spear and song. And so did they find the other pleasing to the eye, and warming to the soul. And so did they sing together, and hunt together, and lay together, and so strong was their love that the wingmaiden, their heart ablaze, stood before [Root.Monarch.GetName] and said\n\n“My queen, I have found a hunter, and he is pleasing to me, and I would keep him with me on this hunt. For while he is earthbound, he is strong, and brave, and would aid your cause and mine.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] rose, and said…"
vaengheim.121.a: "“Your hunter must be worthy indeed, to pry at your heart thusly. It is done.”"
vaengheim.121.b: "“The wingmaidens hunt in heaven where men cannot go. I hold you to your oath.”"

vaengheim.122.t: "Teaching the Tales"
vaengheim.122.d: "And a skald who was named Bunorr Bungusson did join the hunt, and he did win much acclaim for his skilled tongue. Yet many skalds claimed that Bunorr spoke lies and half-truths, and that his songs were not those of old Gerudia. And Bunorr said\n\n“Drab and dry be tales of old Gerudia. I choose to spin a grander tale, and Vængheim’s glory will be the greater for it.”\n\nThen said Snorri Gullmörksmann, who was versed in songs of great power\n\n“This man is a bumbling fool, o queen. The day has been long, let us rest, and put his twisted tongue to test, so that we can sing our songs together again.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] held their hand to their brow, and spoke thusly"
vaengheim.122.a: "“We halt, for Bunorr’s tongue, Snorri’s song and my head.”"
vaengheim.122.b: "“Let the skald who can keep with the hunt, be the victor in this spat. Onwards!”"

vaengheim.123.t: "Shaded Shrine"
vaengheim.123.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim walk through deep and twisted woods, for their wings gave them no sight beneath leaf and fir. Thusly grounded did they find a shrine, where the stones sang songs to gods and heroes old, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw that the woods had nearly taken this place, and said\n\n“These sleeping gods hold a fair aspect, and gentle seem their dreams. Yet gone are their people and lost will be their songs…”"
vaengheim.123.a: "“Let us clear the roots and learn these songs, before the forest takes them.”"
vaengheim.123.b: "“Move on hastily and leave sleeping gods be, for their songs belong to the woods.”"

vaengheim.124.t: "Hungry on the Hunt"
vaengheim.124.d: "Then did Vængheim’s hunters track their quarry, and by sunlight or moonlight did they toil. Many provisions did [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepare, yet the mouths of their host were eager, and soon enough did their bags grow light, their bounty hastily devoured.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], took in the measure of their voracious wingmaidens, and in despair let out a mighty roar."
vaengheim.124.a: "“I shall trade for food, for a hungry hunter is boon only to the prey!”"
vaengheim.124.b: "“This land is rife with a lesser quarry, and a hunter must hunt to eat!”"
vaengheim.124.c: "“Not another crumb will you have, you greedy gulls. Onwards!”"

vaengheim.125.t: "Raring to Rest"
vaengheim.125.d: "Then did the sun set on [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their hunters, and though wingmaidens track well by moonlight, the host grew weary, and sought a resting place.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] then said, though a yawn did muddle their words"
vaengheim.125.a: "“We pitch camp on the trail my sisters, for tonight we roost under heaven.”"
vaengheim.125.b: "“To homestead fair we fly, for I am generous. Tonight you roost under roof!”"

vaengheim.126.t: "Whispers of Wealth"
vaengheim.126.d: "Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] meet a forester of cunning aspect. And hastily did the forester find her knee, and said\n\n“Great is your host O queen, and more do I pity your prey for it. I would offer you lesser quarry, if you have time to give.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] bid her rise and speak, their curiosity awoken.\n\n“Near here lies an old grove, where my homestead grazed our sheep, and gathered wood and herb for many good years. Yet spiders, vast as mine hounds, have made this place theirs, and made prey of my flock, beast and human both. Within our grove lies a barrow, and in this can be found old gold, that belongs to the dead, and who I say would part with it gladly, that their living descendant may again be free to visit them.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] considered this request, and said"
vaengheim.126.a: "“For the wealth of the dead, we shall make quarry of these spiders. Lead on!”"
vaengheim.126.b: "“Yours is a cruel fate, for I do not have time to give. Forward!”"

vaengheim.127.t: "Rockfall"
vaengheim.127.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim encounter a wall. Not brick or mortar, or made by men, but the shrug of a mountain, burying the trail for as far as the eye could see. [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveyed this mighty upheaval, and said"
vaengheim.127.a: "“Find your shovels and your backs, Wingmaidens! We shall uncover the trail yet.”"
vaengheim.127.b: "“Take wing, sisters. Fly along the edge of this heap, and find me where the trail emerges.”"
vaengheim.127.c: "“I packed a bomb for this very toil-... Do not cast your eye on me as if my wits had fled me!”"
vaengheim.127.e: "“A vast field of stone, yet I may yet discern its aspect…”"

vaengheim.128.t: "Obstinate Obstacles"
vaengheim.128.d: "Then did the maidens of Wingheim fly over fields fecund, and their quarry track cross ear of wheat and cereal. And as their feet did touch the ground, did a great roar arise, for Solveig, who was a farmer of pride and skill, did flying hunters spy, and she was wroth, for they crossed her domain. And Solveig did say\n\n“Hark now ye gulls, for I suffer no birds to spoil my crop, whether their face be fair or foul. No cause worth claiming brings your stumbling feet to my field, and I say to you now, depart, or face my pitchfork!”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] said"
vaengheim.128.a: "“Lower your fork, o furious farmer. We knew not where we trod, and will in haste depart.”"
vaengheim.128.b: "“Lower your fork, lest it be cut from your hand, o sullen subject of mine!”"
vaengheim.128.c: "“I would bend your ear,and call you friend, for your field is one worth fighting for…”"

vaengheim.129.t: "Wounded Wing"
vaengheim.129.d: "Then a wingmaiden was struck in their wing, by arrow, stone or witless bird. What assailed them hastily fell away, yet left a cruel wound to mark their passage, and as their blood fell to the earth, were they forced to land, for much did they suffer. [Root.Monarch.GetName] bid their host halt, that wounded wingmaiden be tended to. And they saw the wound, and said"
vaengheim.129.a: "“Ill luck has struck you mightily. We shall pitch camp, and I shall tend to you.”"
vaengheim.129.b: "“Tis but a scratch, and quick will be your mending. To a homestead with you, then onwards!”"

vaengheim.130.t: "Crooked Connections"
vaengheim.130.d: "Then did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] come upon a camp, and wary eyes spied upon them from within every tent and beneath every cowl. A man named Helge sat by his fire, and he found his knee before [Root.Monarch.GetName], and said.\n\n“Plainly shall I speak o queen, for though you be our monarch, we have been foes for many days. For I am a thief, and this is my homestead, and these people are my people, and we were beyond your law until today. Now that you have found us, I would ask your word that you let us be, and if this oath you give, we shall gladly aid you in your hunt. For my people know this land well, and would make fine sport of your quarry.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] felt the eyes of their host upon them, and said…"
vaengheim.130.a: "“Yours is a fair offer, though my people beg to differ. I give you my word.”"
vaengheim.130.b: "“Though you speak with honour, my word I cannot give. Put them in fetters.”"
vaengheim.130.c: "“Mine hall has need of folk like yours. To Vaengheim come, and steal for me instead.”"

vaengheim.131.t: "Overseas Offer"
vaengheim.131.d: "Then did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] fly along the coast, and a trade ship did they spy. And she bore sails of the south, and an envoy was sent to learn their intent. When it was learned that they would call them friend, did [Root.Monarch.GetName] land upon her deck, and meet a maid named Zuhrah, who said\n\n“Honour you bring to my ship, o queen. I hail from distant Sarhal, and though I am stranger to this land, I have heard tell of the quarry you seek. I would give you this in gift, for you are monarch of this realm. All I ask is your word, that you let me ply my trade in your ports. This contract with your sign, will be great boon to mine people and yours.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] glanced at the paper, given to them in swordlike manner. Ill at ease, they said…"
vaengheim.131.a: "“If knowledge you offer, I sign gladly, though your words be foreign to me.”"
vaengheim.131.b: "“I cannot put my sign to this, for I know not the cost. Farewell, fair merchant.”"
vaengheim.131.c: "“I am versed in your letters, my friend, and carry a quill for this very purpose. Let us haggle.”"

vaengheim.132.t: "River Raiders"
vaengheim.132.d: "Then did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] come upon a great river, and many vessels spy. Yet fewer, a wingmaiden did mention, than the year before. Ashore did they land, and a fisherman ask. The man, who was named Balder, found his knee and said\n\n“O queen, your eyes are ever keen, for we have been beset by gnollish pirates from the far south. And their swift craft cleave the sea like knives downriver, and they board any vessel that plies this river at night, where their keen senses make sport of honest traders.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] bid the man rise, and said"
vaengheim.132.a: "“Wingmaidens to me. We make war on these mangy sea dogs!”"
vaengheim.132.b: "“Mine watchmen have been lax. Send a message to the garrison, help them find their sea legs.”"
vaengheim.132.c: "“Gnolls in this land? You lie, fishmonger. Onwards!”"

vaengheim.133.t: "Fake Footprints"
vaengheim.133.d: "Now did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] come upon the trail of their quarry, and it was fresh and clear. Long did they track, and strange grew their path, for the trail led hither and thither, doubling back and finding itself again. Soon did they spy one who would make sport of their hunt. Not fey nor troll, but a man named Aske, who was a hunter.\n\nSwiftly did the Wingmaidens strike at Aske, and with their mighty arms did they bring him to ground. Thus on his belly did [Root.Monarch.GetName] meet him, and said\n\n“I would ask you why you have put down this trail, o hunter. For much time has your toil stolen from me and I am wroth.”\n\nAnd Aske did say\n\n“Greetings o queen. I would find my knee, but your maidens were quicker, and it is now theirs. The trail is not for thee, but for Hans, who is my neighbour, and whom I hold in contempt, for he has made me a cuckold.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say"
vaengheim.133.a: "“Mine time have you stolen. Tell me of this place, and I will name your debt paid.”"
vaengheim.133.b: "“Your tracks are well-laid. I would have you tell me what you know of this place.” "
vaengheim.133.c: "“Hans made you a cuckold, but a fool you were already. Bring me my whip!”"

vaengheim.134.t: "Bothersome Bear"
vaengheim.134.d: "Then did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] pitch camp, and lie down to roost. And gentle were their dreams, yet cruel their awakening, for a great bear had come from the woods, and found their rations fair.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], first to wake, spied the bear, and said"
vaengheim.134.a: "“Fate smiles upon me, and fair morning bears gifts of battle. Taste my spear!”"
vaengheim.134.b: "“I bear this beast no ill will. Let him eat, that we may have a bloodless morning for once.”"
vaengheim.134.c: "“You should make a grizzly friend…”"

vaengheim.135.t: "Troll Toll"
vaengheim.135.d: "Then did the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] come upon a bridge, not wood, but stone, and the work brought honour to the builder. And they did land and walk across, that they may take joy in the fine stonework and fair curve of this great work, so far from town or homestead.\n\nThen did the troll Skadi, who rested beneath the bridge, say\n\n“A song of tiny feet I hear, and spy the queen of Vængheim with her host. Blessed day is this, for I am glad to show mine work to thee. Only, this is my bridge, and a toll must be paid, for this is the law.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew that they had writ no such law, yet heard no lie in Skadi’s voice, and so they said"
vaengheim.135.a: "“Mine is the only law. No toll will I pay, but for your demand you will pay with your life!”"
vaengheim.135.b: "“I know old law and custom, and I will pay your toll.”"
vaengheim.135.c: "“We were merely admiring your work, great one. No crossing today. Take wing!”"
vaengheim.135.e: " “This is a mighty bridge. Your toll will I pay, and I will do so in praise, for this is the law.”"

vaengheim.136.t: "Propaganda Pamphlets"
vaengheim.136.d: "One day did the wingmaidens of Vængheim to the battleroost of [Root.Monarch.GetName] travel, and they carried with them crates of papers, upon which baleful words were writ. For these pamphlets spoke of the rise of Elkaesal, and the restoration of balance to the world, and bid the Reachmen rise against their queen and make a great noise, to rouse Elkaesal from her sleep and save their homes.\n\nThis greatly darkened the mood of [Root.Monarch.GetName], who said"
vaengheim.136.a: "“Burn this filth.”"
vaengheim.136.b: "“Return these papers to their rest, and let us see who comes to claim them.”"

vaengheim.137.t: "Malicious Meetings"
vaengheim.137.d: "Long and strange was this hunt, for the Equilibrists were a curious quarry, for they knew the crafts of men. Yet aided by Reachmen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] bring war to their door, and boldly did their wingmaidens many a furtive gathering unpick.\n\nIt was one of these maidens, a clever gull named Asfrid, who now spoke, and said\n\n“Twisted grows this hunt, for the cult we seek is sly. A meeting have our mannish friends spoken of, and they would have us swoop in and slay these evil men. Yet a thought has come to me, for if we were to let them gather, we would know their names, and their ways, and they might lead us to greater quarry still.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say"
vaengheim.137.a: "“You suggest a clever ploy. Let them meet, to lead us to their doom.”"
vaengheim.137.b: "“Doing so risks much to our people. We will not.”"

vaengheim.138.t: "Suffocating Streets"
vaengheim.138.d: "The hunt in the Reach was a most unlikely toil. Skilled were the wingmaidens in trapping and tracks, yet now their quarry did hide, in mannish forests of timber, stone and narrow street. For great were the cities of the reach, and unlike any hunting ground that they had seen. And other hunters there were as well, who would make prey of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s host. Yet they hid not in brush or canopy, but behind words and smiles. And their claws were hidden steel and unseen venom, and much did the maidens of Vængheim suffer, for they were ill-prepared for this unseen foe.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] grew wroth, for many wounds had their quarry gifted their sisters, and to strike at them was to strike at smoke. Furiously they said"
vaengheim.138.a: "“Accursed city. Fall back and regroup! We must rethink our means.”"
vaengheim.138.b: "“A mannish forest calls for mannish hunters. Let us see what friends we may find in this place.”"

vaengheim.139.t: "Taproom Trap"
vaengheim.139.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim scour the cities of men, and learned again an old lesson. For each quarry there is a tool, and hunting men in their homes called for new snares, some forged from word and rumour. It was one such snare that [Root.Monarch.GetName] sought to craft, for they had found a tavern, whose owner shared their cause. It was known that mannish prey oft drank here, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] sought to bring them to battle where they would not expect. And they said"
vaengheim.139.a: "“Clean the glasses and wipe the tables. Lull our prey to sleep ere we strike them.”"
vaengheim.139.b: "“Bring skalds and music. Let our quarry be deaf to our approach.”"
vaengheim.139.c: "“Anything out of place will alert those with eyes to see. Change nothing.”"

vaengheim.140.t: "Solemn Simulacrum"
vaengheim.140.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim delve,and found in old and dusty halls a marvel of the past. For there stood an old elf, clad in cloth and metal, so fine as to seem otherworldly. Yet it saw them not, and as they closed upon it, did they see it for what it truly was. For the elf was only an image, silent and inert. Light shone through it, and Freydis Oaktongue said\n\n“Tales have I heard of this. It is an owner’s echo, woven by magic. For the old elves were clever, and where we must carve our ancestors’ visage from stone, or find their likeness in pigment and canvas, did the old elves paint in light.”\n\nThen did a wingmaiden speak in turn\n\n“I see of what you speak, and the light shines from a crystal there. Damestear is it, and much wealth should we gain if we took it.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] speak, and said"
vaengheim.140.a: "“Let us be gone. It is ill-luck to play with old ghosts, be they artifice or no.”"
vaengheim.140.b: "“Pitch camp for a spell. Freydis, I would have you make sense of this thing.”"
vaengheim.140.c: "“Neither living nor dead gain from this vanity. Loot it.”"

vaengheim.141.t: "Ravenous Rust"
vaengheim.141.d: "Then did the Wingmaidens of Vængheim encounter a rare, and perilous foe. For a rust monster did them strike mightily, and in ambush took both mail and sword from several brave maidens, leaving them bare to the chill air of this deep place. Much like a fox in a henhouse did this mighty beast trash and flail, and while none were harmed, the beast robbed them of a queen’s ransom in arms and armour.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] did then say"
vaengheim.141.a: "“Trolls! Weaponless is not witless, and I say strike this thing with hand and foot!”"
vaengheim.141.b: "“Run away! Run away!”"
vaengheim.141.c: "…Nothing. They simply raised her hand and slew the beast with a thunderbolt!"

vaengheim.142.t: "Ancient Armaments"
vaengheim.142.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim come upon an armoury of the old elves. And they saw their artifice and found it fair, for there were many arms of unknown aspect, of a craft beyond the ken of those who now gazed upon it. Yet clear it was, that time had mightily bitten these arms of the old world, and their use was long lost to them. thus did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say"
vaengheim.142.a: "“Broken they may be, but we may yet use the metal.”"
vaengheim.142.b: "“Let these dead arms lie, for they are of no use to us, and would only slow us down.”"
vaengheim.142.c: "“Let mine eyes spy these. I shall scry which of these arms are worth taking.”"

vaengheim.143.t: "Wall Writings"
vaengheim.143.d: "Then did Vængheim’s host come upon murals writ in ancient hand, and artworks drawn on wall and floor and ceiling, of a world now long gone. And Freydis Oaktongue did beseech [Root.Monarch.GetName] thus\n\n“Wait, o queen. Let us stay here for a spell. For these mosaics are of expert make, and tell a tale too long forgotten. For old voices sing from the dust in this place, and it would behoove us to take the time to hear them.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] answer"
vaengheim.143.a: "“By all means. Pitch camp, wingmaidens!”"
vaengheim.143.b: "“We will not. No song of the old elves will I hear, for their songs were the bane of their world.”"
vaengheim.143.c: "“Songs are all well and good, but why don’t we take notes as well?”"

vaengheim.145.t: "Wrath of the Winter Wolf"
vaengheim.145.d: "Now did [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Gudrún come upon a cave in the mountains, where the bones of many men were strewn like gravel on the riverbed. There was the resting place of Hati, and they made ready for battle. [Root.Monarch.GetName] cleverly suggested that they light a fire, to smoke out the great wolf, and so they did.\n\nBut Hati was clever as well, and with her white fur did she lay in ambush in the snow. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] set the blaze did Hati strike, leaping with jaws agape to swallow them whole.\n\nThis would have been the end of [Root.Monarch.GetName] if not for Gudrún, who stepped between Hati and her prey. She raised her spear and skewered Hati through the mouth, even as the jaws of the great wolf snapped shut around her. Thus died Gudrún, though she slew Hati as well. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had the heart of Hati placed with Gudrún on her funeral pyre, to honour her saving of their life and avenging her slain kin."
vaengheim.145.a: "Hence, she shall be known as Gudrún Wolfsbane."

vaengheim.146.t: "Just a Little Trolling"
vaengheim.146.d: "Then [Root.Monarch.GetName] did find Jordis Frog-Eater, deep in the forest under snow-clad trees, and they thus addressed her.\n\n“Troll, is it true that you take tribute from my people, and eat those who deny you?”\n\nAnd Jordis answered\n\n“Yes, pale bird, for it is the law of giants. The strong rule over the small, and if you would defend these people, I pity them all the more.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] hefted her spear and said\n\n“Your law is broken, as your giants are broken. You are a fool, troll, to take from my roost. For I am the queen of Vængheim, and I will have back that which you have stolen.”\n\nJordis laughed. “It is you who will be broken, pale bird. I will eat you, and wear your feathers in my hair.”\n\nThen Jordis struck at [Root.Monarch.GetName], and nearly slew them, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] had archers in the trees, and they now loosed on Jordis, who was pierced with hundreds of arrows. Thus died Jordis, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] took all that she had stolen, and returned it to their people, who sang of their valour."
vaengheim.146.a: "And henceforth, they were known as [Root.Monarch.GetName] Goldwing."

vaengheim.147.t: "Absolutely Nackered"
vaengheim.147.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim come to a great mire, and they knew this to be the nacker’s realm, for bones and filth were strewn along the banks in piles tall as two men. [Root.Monarch.GetName] said\n\n“Hark now, least of the giantkin, for the queen of Vængheim has come, and I have come for my son, and the son of Þórdís, and for my peace, which you have broken.”\n\nAnd so did the mire come alive with nackers, who spilled from the fetid waters, and the piles of filth, and who did give battle well, lacking in stature but greater in number than the maidens of Vængheim. The battle turned against [Root.Monarch.GetName], who called their sisters to the sky, though they left many dead or wounded aground, to their shame and the nacker’s cruel teeth.\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] flew to the tower of Gunnar, who was a skald of some renown, and they said.\n\n“Skald, you sing the songs of Alos. But now your queen needs your voice. Do this thing for me, and I will honour you.”\n\nGunnar, who was clever, said\n\n“You honour me already. I will sing for you if you take me to husband.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] agreed, and Gunnar sang of Elkaesal, whose very name turned the great mire to ice. And the nackers were struck by fingers of frost, and they were slain. [Root.Monarch.GetName] told Þórdís that as they shared sons, so did they share husbands, and so did Þórdís and Gunnar marry, and they had many strong children."
vaengheim.147.a: "We win"

vaengheim.148.t: "Bearly a Challenge!"
vaengheim.148.d: "Then [Root.Monarch.GetName] did find Geir under the full moon, on a hill in the woods. And they raised her spear and said\n\n“Accursed one. I have come to put you both to rest. Shed your skin so that we may fight.”\n\nAnd Geir did so, and holmgång was joined. The battle was hard, for Geir’s pelt was proof against [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s spear. As the moon looked away, and the sun began to rise, did Geir catch them in his great paws, and he began to crush their life from them. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] drew their knife, which was forged from ebonsteel, and struck Geir in the eye. Thus Geir was given a banewound, and he was slain, his great form changing to that of a man once more.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] rose and said\n\n“I have avenged many, and done my duty as queen. Yet there is no glory in this victory, for I have slain two souls with one strike. A man without honour, and a beast without reason.”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] wept."
vaengheim.148.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was henceforth known as “Eyebiter”"

vaengheim.149.t: "Of Harpies and Hags"
vaengheim.149.d: "Then [Root.Monarch.GetName] did hunt, not for Grandmother Kraka, but for a battlefield. And they chose a glacier, and sent their wingmaidens with bow and arrow, to draw the trolls to them. Thus did the host of Kraka clash with the host of [Root.Monarch.GetName] on the glacier, and blood flowed so free as to dye the ice red. Yet Kraka sang her evil songs, and great crows fell from the sky to peck at the eyes of Vængheim’s host. And madness and fear gripped their hearts, and they fled the field in shame. And Kraka said\n\n“Look at your flock, oh queen of Vængheim, and feast your eyes now, on the hag-queen of Gerudia. For I have taken the field, and I will take your throne and your people.”\n\nBut [Root.Monarch.GetName], who alone stood red field, answered thusly\n\n“Much have you taken from me, but I am yet queen of Gerudia, and I am generous. You will have more than you have asked for.”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] took flight and their skalds, who were concealed in the mountains, began to sing a cruel song of breaking. And the glacier split in twain, and a hundred trolls fell into a hundred yawning mouths of ice. Last to fall was grandmother Kraka, who was light on her feet, yet was felled by [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s spear, which fell upon her from the sky and pierced her, and she uttered a terrible howl, and fell to join her foul children in the crumbling glacier, and she was no more."
vaengheim.149.a: "The broken glacier was henceforth named “The Crowsfall”"

vaengheim.150.t: "Roc On"
vaengheim.150.d: "Now did [Root.Monarch.GetName] hunt the great blue Roc, and sought Blåfjöður in the depth of the sky. Yet the sky was vast, and Blåfjöður had greater wings than any wingmaiden. Oft would the hunt find him in flight, but he would flap his wings mightily, and in haste escape pursuit. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] did say\n\n“I am greatly vexed, for we have met our match in heaven. Yet a Roc cares not for what lies above, for none would strike him from the skies. Fly high, my sisters!”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their strongest wingmaidens take wing to fly high, higher than ever before, and they suffered greatly in the cold sky. Yet the fire of the hunt did warm their hearts, even as their limbs grew cold, and their breath was stolen from them, and as they saw Blåfjöður did they dive, striking the Roc frightfully from above, and dealing him his bane wound.\n\nYet high was the price paid for [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s plot, for the wings of their wingmaidens had frozen, and as they slew Blåfjöður did they join him in death, striking the earth mightily with their bodies and shattering like glass on anvil. Only [Root.Monarch.GetName] lived, for they had pierced Blåfjöður’s great heart with their spear, and were thus shielded by his great body. And they named the field in which their friends had fallen “Featherfall” in their honour. For their valour, [Root.Monarch.GetName] took the name “Rocstalker”."
vaengheim.150.a: "…Many others named them “The Lucky Idiot”, though never to their face."

vaengheim.151.t: "Father of Ferns"
vaengheim.151.d: "Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their host reach the old wood, and they said\n\n“Rest here, for the wight is clever, and will not come if I bring a host to battle. Alone I will go.”\n\nAnd their wingmaidens were ill at ease, yet did obey their words, for they held them in regard.\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] enter the wood, and sat to rest their wings by a lake. And they began to sing songs of flight and sky, and their voice was heard by the trees and the stones and the water.\n\nThen did a voice sing to them, of creaking branch, and shifting stone and rushing water. And it said\n\n“You enter my hall clad for battle, o child of the sky. Yet you gift the wood your song, and a splendid gift it is. But why do you rest so far from home?”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] did say\n\n“It is not for my sake, old one, but for the cause of Asbjörn, who you have taken.”\n\nThen did the voice shiver wrothfully\n\n“My son you will not have, child of the sky. For he is dear to me, and was given to me in bargain by his father, who loved him not. Seven years was Kåre given, of golden harvest and good fortune.”\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetName] flew with their host to Kåre's hall, and spoke of this. And Kåre did yell in fury and gnash his teeth mightily. Then with his sword did he strike at [Root.Monarch.GetName] and would have slain them, if not for a piece of bark, caught in their dress where the blade struck. [Root.Monarch.GetName] then struck Kåre mightily with their hand, and the earth rose to embrace him. And they said\n\n“Hark now. Craven do I name you and exile do I name your penance. Seven years the wight gave you. Seven days I give you to begone from my realm.”\n\nKåre did as he was bid, and was seen no more. Of him, the skalds do not sing."
vaengheim.151.a: "..But the woods sang of Queen [Root.Monarch.GetName], and they named them friend."

vaengheim.152.t: "The Source of Skalds"
vaengheim.152.d: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their host took upon the odd hunt, did they travel across and beyond Vængheim. Many skalds did they find and call to the halls of the dragonkin, to sing a new song of Elkaesal, and bring them relief.\n\nBut the dragonkin heard pain in every word, and no skald could sway them from their cause. Many in Vængheim counselled war, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] said\n\n“Hark now, for my heart grows heavy. I take wing alone, to seek guidance in the sky. When I return, I shall give you war or peace.”\n\nAnd then they left their roost.\n\nAs they flew did they hear a song on the wind. Northbound they flew, into a mighty blizzard, which cut at their flesh and tore at their wings. Death nearly took them then, but the song pierced the wind, and guided them to a fire, kept by a one-armed man. The winds were calm here, and as [Root.Monarch.GetName] took warmth by the fire, did the song mend their bruises and kindle their heart. And they said\n\n“You are well-versed, skald. I owe you much.”\n\nThe skald, copper-skinned with sun-bleached hair, shook his head and said\n\n“You owe me nothing, wingmaiden. If my song pleases you, I thank you, for I give it freely. But I have been alone for a long time, and would owe you in return, if you would sing with me.”\n\nAnd so did the skald and [Root.Monarch.GetName] sing together until the blizzard abated. Then [Root.Monarch.GetName] told the skald of the plight of their realm, and he said\n\n“You share the pains of your people, and your burden is mine. Let us return to your hall, and sing to your people of peace.”\n\nThen did [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the skald return to Vængheim, and together did they sing to the dragonkin, who found new cause in Elkaesal's slumber, and they were at peace."
vaengheim.152.a: "Thus was [Root.Monarch.GetName] named “Gentlesong”, and theirs was a good reign."

vaengheim.153.t: "Burning Fields and Broken Peace"
vaengheim.153.d: "Long and arduous was the hunt in the Reach, for the Wingmaidens were skilled in war, and the hunting of wild things. Yet man is a clever beast, and a hunter of man must contend with man's snares, traps and cunning.\n\nSo did the Reachmen burn their own fields, and make war upon one another, brother and sister, and son and mother embattled. And the smoke rose to the sky, and stung the eyes of the Gods, who saw the kinstrife, and named it hateful.\n\nIt was in those red years, that [Root.Monarch.GetName] met a Reachman named Cassan, who their wingmaidens had brought low. And his wounds would have slain him if not for their healing arts. And he had found his heart, and pledged himself to Vængheim, and taking knee, he said\n\n“Greatly have I shamed myself, for I have turned my sword upon my queen, and slain my kin. Yet in so doing I have learned what I must now share unto you. For this strife is a thing forged in shadow, by men whose hearts are darkened. And this darkness has grown in them, and sprouted in their eyes, so that they see only foulness in your law. They seek to unmake you, and it is the great wyrm Elkaesal, who they would wake to strike against you.”\n\nAnd shocked did [Root.Monarch.GetName] answer\n\n“Were Elkaesal to wake, we should all fare poorly. For she carries winter in her heart, and would share her cold with all the world, to the doom of us all. These men have dark eyes indeed, to seek such a thing.”\n\nAnd then Cassan did weep, for he knew her words were true, and the hall of Vængheim was shaken."
vaengheim.153.a: "Brr..."

vaengheim.154.t: "Under the Gaze of the Gods"
vaengheim.154.d: "Then did the host of Vængheim and the Equilibrists see battle at last, for the cult had taken Aldtempel, and named it their house. Fierce was the battle, and many were slain, for the Equilibrists waged war as if possessed. Yet in open battle were their failings laid bare, and queen [Root.Monarch.GetName] won the field. It would become a bloody victory, for the reachmen had many grudges to settle. By day's end, no Equilibrist could be counted among the living.\n\nYet as the moon rose over Aldtempel, did the horrors within grow plain. For the cult had taken people in their thousands, many thought dead, yet held here in bondage. And on the great altar of Aldtempel had they been slain in numbers beyond counting, their hearts torn open to the sky, so that they who sought to unfetter the living, would toil through the blood and broken flesh of the slain. A skald saw this bloodied shrine, and said\n\n“This is ill done, for they have sinned against gods old and new, by making their house a place of slaughter. Worse yet, this is the magic of Granny Kraka, a foul curse to strike at Elkaesal. For with sorcery and sacrifice, the Equilibrists sought to stain her dreams with the blood and pain of thousands, and wrest her from the skald’s' peace.”\n\nThen the skald wept, for he knew that though he would leave this place, this place would never leave him. And on this day did the Reachmen under Vængheim’s wing take the name “Grey Reachmen”, in memory of the ashes of their home.\n\nYet all was not so grim, for many were still in bondage, and they were made free, and they did sing of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and of Vængheim, and of the heroes that had saved them from a cruel doom. And in the temple did they find many treasures which the cult had stolen, and learned that great wealth had been given unto the Equilibrists from a secret friend, who would see Vængheim undone.."
vaengheim.154.a: "A trifling victory, but a victory nonetheless."

vaengheim.155.t: "The Queen of the Alen"
vaengheim.155.d: "The hunt for the spiders of Gaweton grew long and cruel, for the queen of the Alen was much unlike field or forest. Man-made trees housed malicious eyes, and the wingmaidens of Vængheim were little loved by the Gawedi. Even as the queen of Gaweton did [Root.Monarch.GetName] find few friends and many foes in this place. Weary of this did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say\n\n“When this city fell under my wing, I saw it, but I did not know it. I did not then and I do not now, but were I to see with my eyes and hear with my ears, I would judge that it be burned and unmade, and that a great field be grown here, where men may toil the earth free of it.”\n\nYet all the same did Vængheim's eyes unwind the webs of Gaweton, and with each thread they picked at, did spiders strike at them, but so too did the web come undone, until it seemed a frail thing, swaying in the wind. Godric and Cassan came to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and told them of a man named Welyam, who stood at the heart of this web. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] did rise and fly to him with their host. And many men swore fealthy to Welyam, but their hearts belonged to his gold, and as the wingmaidens descended upon his hall did they break and flee like mist before the sun.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their wingmaidens entered the hall of Welyam, did they see a man, bent with age. By a great window did he stand, and the wind tugged at his heavy cloak, clad in furs and gold. For he was no fighting man, and his best days were behind him."
vaengheim.155.a: "Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] say..."

vaengheim.1550.t: "The Bitter Dreams of Men"
vaengheim.1550.d: "…“You who is named Welyam, magnate of Gaweton. You strike at me but you are not known to me. What have I done to you, for you to hate me so?”\n\nAnd Welyam bared his yellow teeth, and he did say\n\n“Nothing have you done, but take my hall and make it yours. For I remember when this city was the heart of a great realm, in which I was a man of substance. You and your mothers unwound this realm, and in war did you take my sons and my daughters, who stood against you. For this have I grown to hate you, and I would see this world die, but to see your realm brought low before mine. For I am old, and mine own time nearly spent. What use to me is a future in which I have no part?”\n\nThen did Welyam, with a strength unlike his age, leap and throw himself from the window, not unlike a wingmaiden taking flight. But Welyam was no wingmaiden, and the stones of Gaweton rose to strike him, and he was dead.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] said nothing, and kept their own council, but their wingmaidens did say hence, that a shadow fell over [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s heart this day."
vaengheim.1550.a: "And no name did [Root.Monarch.GetName] claim, though they had abjured a great foe."

vaengheim.156.t: "Wonders of the Old World"
vaengheim.156.d: "Now did [Root.Monarch.GetName] behold the toil of their people, for Freydis Oaktongue and her kin were each as strong as twenty men. Day by day did they delved deeper, and what had been a scar on the land, soon became a gaping wound. Cruel did it seem, yet majestic also, for as the past was ripped free from the grip of the earth, did the ancient world make itself seen, and all who saw it were in awe.\n\nFor it was a tower, but unlike the works of man, or elf or troll. From the roots of mountains was it hewn, and the walls were not made from stone, but of the stone. Neither brick nor mortar was in use, for the tower was a single body. Battlements there were, and many gates and windows. Yet all vast as to dwarf even trolls, and all cut from stone, in a way that brought honour to the artisan. Freydis beheld this house, and said\n\n“I stand now in the house of my forefathers, who breathed life into my people. And I see here all that we are, yet greater than we. And I am bereaved, for it is a rare thing for me to feel small. And I hear in this place a song, of ages past, and of dreams that never were, for the dreamers are dead, and only their empty house remains, buried alive beneath the stone, too strong to die, yet...”\n\nAnd Freydis fell silent, and spoke no more.\n\nThen did the wingmaidens fly into the tower, and they did find many tablets of stone, written in a great hand. And the writing spoke of magic, runes to yoke wind and weather. And the writing spoke of another place, far to the west, where other masters wove a song akin to theirs.\n\nAnd the writing spoke of wealth, for it was writ in liquid damestear, an ink worth more than gold, and plentiful in the stores of this ancient place."
vaengheim.156.a: "It even glows in the dark!"

vaengheim.157.t: "Cunning of the Old Elves"
vaengheim.157.d: "Then did [Root.Monarch.GetName] set out, and with a host did cross the Lament. And they found Aelantir pleasing to their eye, for it was much like their homeland, and their people had found great wealth there. And so too did [Root.Monarch.GetName] behold the descendants of the Precursors, and their ways, and they found them fair. So too did Freydis, who saw in them fellow children of the ancient world.\n\nSoon after did [Root.Monarch.GetName] reach the place of which Freydis had spoken, and they did find a door to the ancient world in this place. Yet the ruins of the old elves were much unlike those of the giants, and sang much of ways unlike them. Bare were the old halls, bereft of art or ornament. And Freydis, who struggled mightily in the narrow halls, did say\n\n“This place is unlike that of my forefathers, for it is built for singular purpose, and what was needed was hereto placed, and no love nor care was given here. If once a soul resided here, it fled with those who worked here, and left this place struck dumb, with no tale to tell after long years.”\n\nAnd then Freydis wept.\n\nYet the old elves were clever, and many cold songs had they written, on scrolls that fought bitterly against the teeth of time. Some were broken, but many did [Root.Monarch.GetName] find, and they were freed from the earth, and brought from this tomb back to the living world."
vaengheim.157.a: "Surely nothing bad will come of this…"

vaengheim.158.t: "The Thumb of Uelos"
vaengheim.158.d: "Perhaps it was fate that beheld the work of the old elves and found it hateful, or perhaps they simply thought [Root.Monarch.GetName] unworthy of it, for a mighty storm struck Vængheim's fleet as they crossed the Lament home. Many ships were blown off course, and some were lost to the abyss, maiden and mouse. Yet it was the flagship, upon which Freydis and [Root.Monarch.GetName] resided, that the storm smote most mightily, battering the ship as if it the very seas had come alive, and sought to crush them with watery fists.\n\nIn the end, the ship could take no more, and she was torn in twain by a thunderbolt, spilling much of the cunning of the old elves into the Lament. [Root.Monarch.GetName], ever brave, gripped Freydis in their claws. Yet vast was Freydis, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] risked much to hold her from her doom. And Freydis said\n\n“Let me go, o queen. For the sea is my bane, and if this be my end, I will not shirk from it. A good life have I lived, for if this be the price of dreams, I pay it gladly. Better this than to have never dreamt at all.”\n\nThen Freydis broke free from [Root.Monarch.GetName], and the seas took her. By wing did [Root.Monarch.GetName] make for another ship, and the storm abated. Many scrolls were lost, but not all, for Freydis had split the bounty between the fleet. Bloodied did the fleet return to Sporreyn, and a great feast was held, to honour their return and mourn those lost to Uelos. Mourned was Freydis, but her people used the cunning of the old elves, and in Sporreyn did raise a new tower, joining elf and giantkin. Never were they able to yoke the sky, but many clever ways were found, to soften her blows and grow her bounty, and all of Vængheim would profit from their toil."
vaengheim.158.a: "And they named it “Oaktongue Tower”."

vaengheim.160.t: "The Hunt Goes Cold"
vaengheim.160.d: "Then did Vængheim’s host come upon, a trail gone cold and trod upon, for none could find their quarry. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] was greatly vexed, for they felt the gaze of their foremothers, cold upon their neck. For there was neither head nor heel of what they sought, and at the heart of any wingmaiden who holds a heart of honour, lies the hunt. For to hunt is to live, to chase is to breathe, and to find what you seek, is the greatest glory of all.\n\nYet there can be no glory without risk of failure. And failure is a bitter thing, for if to hunt is to live, so must it be, that abandoning the hunt is to die.\n\nSo it was in older days. Today was a gentler day. [Root.Monarch.GetName] felt no death, though their heart was swollen with shame. They bowed their head, and slowly said… "
vaengheim.160.a: "“Wingmaidens. We return to roost.”"

vaengheim.161.t: "Yet She Wakes"
vaengheim.161.d: "Now were many feasts made ready, and many celebrations were had, for the one-armed skald had warmed the heart of the bereaved dragonkin, and they were glad to rest under Vængheim’s wing. And all knew that now soon, summer would return, and Gerudia would suffer no longer.\n\nAnd summer did come, and it was mild and warm. And some did say that it was colder than most, but many thought these the words of old, bitter souls, who had a chill in their bones that no sun could touch.\n\nBut then winter came. And with winter came snow, and the snow fell in blankets thick, and it was said that the air danced with such chill, that even the Giant’s Grave froze solid, so that Olavlunder and Reachman needed neither ship nor fins to walk across it and visit the hearths of one another.\n\nAll of this greatly vexed [Root.Monarch.GetName], and the dragonkin assured them that it was not their songs that brought winter to their door. [Root.Monarch.GetName] called to their council many skalds, and the cold yet nipped at them, and lent them urgency.\n\n“Once now you have sung songs of ill omen unto me, and I have heard and hunted, and thought to make us safe. Yet she wakes.”\n\nAnd [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed at each face in turn, and saw dread therein, and found it fair, for dreadful was this doom. Then they said.\n\n“There is aught else in my power, for the sky is my domain, and Elkaesal rests beyond my gaze, under the bones of this land. There is another way, though it is a dire one.”"
vaengheim.161.a: "And [Root.Monarch.GetName] took leave of her council, to plan and make ready…"

This tale tells of that journey, and our struggles along the way. The battles with the trolls, our friendship with the men of Olavlund, and Krjá's fateful meeting with the one armed skald, who would set us on our path of duty."

She herself is a blizzard, an eternal force of winter that must bring the ice and cold - for she IS the ice and cold. So she sleeps, and we keep her thus. For surely she has no more wish to destroy than we to die."

Long ago in the fifth century, Gerudia fell into a deep winter due to a monstrous dragon known as Elkaesel the White. A brave one-armed Skald selflessly ventured to face the beast, and sang it to sleep. Ever since then, the Skaldhyrric Faith has recited this tale to remind everyone of their history and how much it depends on the Skalds."
