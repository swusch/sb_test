haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.t: "The Jiangshi Vampires of Heiyukcheng"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.d: "Just after we had put the final touches on the expansion of the Black Jade Citadel of Heiyukcheng, a small delegation of rather unusual people arrived. They introduced themselves as representatives of the Eternal Council, a group of vampiric undead sorcerers that formerly ruled from the Black Temple of Jincheng. In exchange for being allowed the freedom to operate within our state, they are offering their services to us as vampires. Should we take them up on this offer?"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.a: "We shall let the seeds of darkness fester..."
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.b: "Vampires? Outrageous. Guards, arrest this delegation at once!"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.c: "Vampires? What does he mean? We already have vampires!"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.e: "What is he talking about? We, The Eternal Council, are still in power!"

halessi_monuments_house_of_fire_and_water_artificers.t: "Alchemists and Artificers of Luoyip"
halessi_monuments_house_of_fire_and_water_artificers.d: "With the finishing touches of the new improvements and expansion of the House of Fire and Water being put in place, a delegation representing members of the House's staff has approached us. While thanking us for our continued contributions and investments into encouraging the study and practice of alchemy and the natural world within the state, the staff are requesting that they, and thus by extension alchemy and even artificery itself, be made an official and integral part of the state apparatus. In return, they promise that their alchemical endeavors and teachings of the natural and unnatural sciences will be at the service of the country. Should we take them up on this offer?"
halessi_monuments_house_of_fire_and_water_artificers.a: "We shall give artificery the full support of the state!"
halessi_monuments_house_of_fire_and_water_artificers.b: "Our resources are better spent elsewhere."
halessi_monuments_house_of_fire_and_water_artificers.c: "The staff of Luoyip have been living under a rock. We already support artificery!"
