For the faithful of the Regent Court across Cannor, this is a time of mourning, for the pantheon has lost its unequivocal leader. However, for followers of our faith, this is a time of opportunity and celebration. Castellos was far from the just ruler he is often portrayed as—he was a tyrant like any other monarch, and the fate of our patrons serves as a vivid testament to this.\n\n[Root.IC_conversion_event_desc_deity]\n\nCultists who share faith in our patron have arrived among us. Until recently, they were forced to hide in the shadows, persecuted and hunted. However, Castellos' recent death has shaken the faith of many on the continent in the justice and strength of the Regent Court. Moreover, the strife between the usurper’s heirs, Adean and Corin, sows even more uncertainty. These cultists seek our support to launch a widespread campaign of conversion in regions of the continent where the cult of our patron is already present. If we seize this moment, we have a chance to ignite a religious revolution, though our neighbors are unlikely to welcome such actions. If we fail to show the courage of our convictions, however, our own followers may lose faith in this new age."

 infernal_events.101.d: "A worrying report has found its way to the doors of our court. It tells of a dark and devilish cult which has supplanted a well known den of debauchery and vices within our demesne. Whilst rumours of this type are known to often appear yet rarely prove true, in this case an unexpecting watchman accidentally stumbled into a den of vice and heretical madness on his break. In an unassuming basement, icons of the Infernal Court wreathed and painted across walls, red candles and ritual circles, and more were uncovered.\n\nAfter a tactical retreat, the watchman spread the news to his superiors through confidential channels, and the news has now reached the ear of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. The decision is obvious for many: Strike them down and utterly eradicate the vile heresy and see the perpetrators scattered to the corners of Halann!"

Fortunately, the hunter reported instantly to their local watch, which soon sent word to us. These cults of the Infernal Court are known to exist, but rare is it that we catch one during their vile worship.\n\nIf we were to strike quickly and decisively, we could still interrupt their dark rituals. Naturally, our temples urge us to send our soldiers to stamp out these devils before they do greater damage to the spiritual health of our people."

[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attention is drawn from the ever-growing stack of papers before them, to the sudden intrusion of sound into the quiet. A frown graces [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face, and the doors open to reveal the smiling face of one of the many courtiers that graces the court, with a bottle of wine – some of the finest from the Bay of Wines to be found.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eyes drift once more to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] work, and then back to the courtier. At the current hour, a break surely could not hurt too badly? A few cups are exchanged. Laughs shared and camaraderie established. Finally, an unspoken tension is broken when the words leave the courtier’s mouth. “Tell me, [Root.Monarch.GetName] what do you make of matters of faith?”\n\nMore words are exchanged, the wine loosens tongues, and soon the conversation steers toward mythology. “The call of the Clarionate, the slaying of Malliath, and the casting down of Kazraiel. Don’t you think it’s unfair?”\n\n“Whatever could you mean?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] replies.\n\n“These gods were so harshly punished for their legitimate desires. Don’t we all feel some sympathy for them?”"

Religious conflict devours the continent under a flame of passionate faith and belief in Corin, and the immediate response from those faithful to Adean. This is a time of troubles, terror and wanton bloodshed. However, to the associates of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName], this is a time of opportunity to rightfully decry the injustice levied against the Infernal Court.\n\nAnxiety stirs in the heart of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] associates in the cults douse [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] worries with wine and brandy, urging [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to head into the royal court and declare the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the [Root.GovernmentName] loyal to the betrayed and unjustly punished Infernal Court.\n\n“For the cause. For us.” they whisper. “Please, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. For your friends. We are so close.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName] stands. Pushing through the heavy doors, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stares down [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] confused advisors and associates; those in the know smiling and nodding, whilst most simply tilt their head in confusion.

 IC_conversion_event_desc_kazraiel:0 "Kazraiel had never seen the Heavens and was cast out simply because he was born from the tainted essence of Agrados and Castellos. His sole crime was his origin, and for that he was punished. Can such actions truly define a worthy ruler?"
 IC_conversion_event_desc_hedine:0 "Hedine was exiled for daring to stand with Agrados against Castellos, one of countless examples of the petty and pathetic nature of the Heavenly tyrant.

 IC_conversion_event_desc_mesner:0 "Mesner was punished simply for remaining neutral, refusing to assist either side. This once again reveals the corrupt nature of Castellos and his so-called virtue.
