Instinctively he jumps forward as a thrown axe narrowly misses his head. The General swivels around, knocking his bow as the orc berserker rushes him. Oberon lets loose three arrows in one, felling his enemy as he spots his steed Justice atop a far hill. He sprints, diving over dying orcs and elves as he moves with instinct to reach his stag mount, his friend since childhood. If he can reach Justice, the battle could still be won…\n\nBut the crush of soldiers pushes against him, and Oberon is pulled back. He shouts, but Justice does not respond. He vanishes behind the fighting masses. A figure bumps past him. Then another. They were his soldiers..\n\n'NO!' The Commander screams as a wave of pursuing orcs set upon him, their axes descending into Oberon's chest. A pain erupts in Oberon's heart as he gasps awake.\n\n'My love?' [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] asks, jolted awake.\n\nOberon breaths. It was just a nightmare, one of the recent many since the orc's invasion. Olyfra's hands gently caress his chest as a knock comes at the door. Who could that be at this hour?\n\n'My lord? It's-it's urgent! We've received word- I-, Corin has slain Korgus Dookanson!

Did he really want to do this?\n\n'Citizens of Salla Fealgarn-'' Oberon starts as a roaring cheer greets him.\n\nNora’s heart drops as the reality of everything hits her. The support for Oberon seemed borderline fanatical. His recent laws revoked any rights of elves to avoid state inspection, and the draft was being increased to even the saplings, who had barely seen a decade and a half. And here he was, about to declare himself King.\n\n'We face a grand threat to our very survival, and not just against us but all of the Deepwoods. We must stand united, under one banner, my banner to face it.'\n\nWas this right? Was this truly the future? Her mind begins to swirl only to be stopped by a glint off in the distance.

This was the hero of the Greentide, a firm hand that guided Salla Fealgarn through times of trouble, and the heir of the founder of the clan.\n\nThe doors slam open as Oberon, chained, resisting slightly, was dragged in by eight guards all struggling to keep him restrained. Shouts and jeers both cursing Oberon and defending him break out as the council rapidly reads through a statement.\n\n'Oberon Fealgarn, you stand accused of subverting the democratic norms of our clan, of plotting a military coup to overthrow our traditions, sending your political opponents to death in flawed missions during the Greentide, and for warcrimes of leading Orcish hordes to other salla resulting in massacres. How do you plead?'\n\nAmongst the verbal melee, Oberon clears his throat, sending the entire room into a dead silence. The General looks around slowly before staring unrepentantly at the council.\n\n'They're all true.' Oberon speaks loudly as gasps erupt from his supporters. 'And I’d do it again!'' He shouts as the room devolves into a frenzy.\n\n'We face a greater threat, a corrupted powerful Fey Lady from beyond seeking to destroy us. I did what I had to do to protect Salla Fealgarn, I make no apologies for the defense of my clan. This is no true trial, it is a sham, a political trial! Give me your sentence cowards!'

He gave her an understanding nod and, after a moment, she recounted what occurred.\n\nAs she led the monsters away from her allies, she was cornered into a dead end. Drawing her bow, she was ready to fight till the end until a man appeared. A man taller than Oberon, with an unnatural silver glow riding upon a steed unlike any stag she had seen. Then she felt a power grow within her as she raised her bow. The monsters fell moments later. When she turned around, the man was gone. Her professors question her report, saying what she describes was not just a Fey Lord, it was the Lord of Beasts. Oberon only leans in closer as she recounts this.\n\nAnd the woman’s voice?\n\n’Someone-some…thing. Not of this world. A corruption, but her voice was so clear too.’\n\nOberon furrows his brow.

Scared beyond belief, she barely survived and that was by intervention from a Fey Lord who was fickle in his boons.

Each night I won at the cost of bits of my mind. But slowly my faculties were unraveling and my enemies were too aware of it. Especially her. \n\nMy eyes should be focused on the staircase but my mind runs through a list of preparations I laid out in the event of my passing. The Academy was up and running, commanders loyal to my ideals in place to follow my war plans, and incorruptible judges to revoke all of my dictatorial legislation. My people would hate me for all I’ve done, but they would be alive, and in a century there would be statues of my likeness throughout the Deepwoods.\n\nRed eyes appear from the staircase and I breathe deeply.

They were not condemned like me, House Fealgarn stands to be inherited by my son.\n\nI return my gaze to my people and ponder my choices. Did I go too far in my drive to defeat her? Or was this of her covert actions? Did she convince the spirit of my people against me? In either case, my people were stalwart and strong.

Only later did scholars learn he was suffering from a break in his mind stemming from the mental wounds of war, but by then it was too late to avert his descent.\n\nThe statue that was built of his image in front in the capital square brought supporters and detractors.

And with our success rate, and given my experiences with facing these aberrations, me and my team have been sent to investigate a powerful Warped presence somewhere in Krazho! The army was able to reclaim the region from the orcs, but it is time for us Huntsmen and Huntresses to work.\n\nWe are to not only hunt down this Warped being, but to try and interrogate it. My new team member Soala, is able to rip the truth out from any enemy with her blade, literally!\n\nThis Warped might be a tough cookie, it's apparently prowling in the forests and resembles a giant wolf! I'm sure me, my stag Crescent, and my team of Huntresses can take it on no problem. I'm just…worri-no let me rephrase. I-….I am concerned what we'll learn from this interrogation. Oh!
