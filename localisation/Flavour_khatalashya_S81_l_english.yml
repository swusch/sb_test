 khatalashya_araizary_support_title: "Araizary Support"
 khatalashya_araizary_support_desc: "When the gods created lizardfolk, they also created guides for their creations. They created the first araizary, the Thraxis, and from it was born every other araizary. They are like us, and Taneyas is their home as much as it is ours. Most Araizary live on the water - not just the sea but the very air itself. Skipping from raindrop to raindrop, passing through the mists, appearing to lost sailors and waylaid explorers to help them. With the support of the Araizary, we too shall become creatures of both the land and sea."
 khatalashya_araizary_support_tt: "Gain 3 Marines when recruiting explorers"

 khatalashya_tribal_naga_title: "Tribal Naga"
 khatalashya_tribal_naga_desc: "None more deserve the accolades for leading lizardfolk to the prophesied Final Empire than the naga. It is they whose steady hand – or rather, gaze – have guided our society to this long promised glory. Sometimes though, those naga who live in the great cities can take too much of the attention. They guide the leaders of great nations and the people of our thriving cities, but it is the sole naga tending to their tribal flock with little help from outside support who deserve more attention. We need to start supporting the local naga of these tribes, for some of them may not even realise the prophecy has been fulfilled."

 khatalashya_aquatic_beings_title: "Aquatic Beings"
 khatalashya_aquatic_beings_desc: "What makes lizardfolk special compared to the many other races in this world? Our diversity from mutations is a good starting point, but that we are just at home on the water is another. Lizardfolk are capable of surviving and thriving in all sorts of environments. There have been historic lizardfolk empires based out of the desert, on islands – even on one occasion operating entirely underwater, as was the case with the 80th Empire. Ever since the Onslaught some two and a half millennia ago, lizardfolk have lost their island-hopping ways. We should strive to bring them back. We cannot be the greatest Final Empire if we don’t at least cover the territory all past empires did."

 khatalashya_the_great_cities_title: "The Great Cities"
 khatalashya_the_great_cities_desc: "A human builder once asked a lizardfolk explorer to describe the architectural style of the lizardfolk. The answer: a hundred thousand years of styles all built on top of each other. Every one of the great lizardfolk cities has been built atop existing locales. Cities like Shalazar and Zerat have stood in the same place for millennia, building and rebuilding. Some houses have stood in the same place for thousands of years. The stone may change. The rooms may change. The roof may change. Yet it is still the same great building standing in the same great city. In this way, no lizardfolk city ever truly dies."

 khatalashya_the_merfolk_canal_title: "The Merfolk Canal"
 khatalashya_the_merfolk_canal_desc: "Merfolk and lizardfolk have not always gotten along. This rarely erupted into open hostility, though many lizardfolk did not appreciate that the merfolk made the sacred Arskitse Zatsarya into their home. Instead it was just coldness and distance.\n\nA merfolk queen has recently approached us at the port in Khugra with a fascinating proposal, however: build a canal across the Jasiir Jadid.\n\nFor the merfolk, this would have innumerable benefits. The thin strip of mountains are insurmountable for any merfolk, preventing merfolk on either side from ever seeing each other, despite the distance amounting to but a day’s journey as the crow flies. Such a canal would be incredible for our efforts too, as ship travel all the way around Ardimya can take an intolerable amount of time. Travel to Haless could be so much easier if we followed their scheme."

 khatalashya_the_merfolk_canal_tt: "Can build the §YMerfolk Canal§! great project in Jas Shar."

 khatalashya_empire_of_souls_title: "Empire of Souls"
 khatalashya_empire_of_souls_desc: "The excitement over the history of the Empire of Souls has grown within our empire. Lupulan, the great lizard spirit, must be a sign that the rainforest in south Haless was once the home of lizardfolk. Who knows what else could be there? The humans that live in the Lupulan Rainforest are understandably not aware of the majesty of our past empires and may not have recognised lizardfolk ruins for what they truly are. It’s time to reclaim Lupulan in the name of the lizardfolk. Said claim may be 80,000 years old, but all claims are permanent for the Final Empire."
 khatalashya_empire_of_souls_tt: "Have learned an important detail about the Empire of Souls"

 khatalashya_arskitse_empire_title: "Arskitse Empire"
 khatalashya_arskitse_empire_desc: "The 330th Empire was a naval-based empire. Its capital was located on the island with the Arskitse Spire - the very same spire that now is half-submerged in the sea. It wasn’t that long ago that it stood proud on that island, entirely above sea level, but the island was sunk in the wake by the Deep Devils during The Onslaught, when creatures from the deep ocean rose up to attack coastal settlements not just across Taneyas but as far north as the Dragon Coast in Cannor and into the Divenhal. Ever since the Arskitse Empire collapsed, many Lizardfolk have not dared sail out further than Fahvanosy. So many islands, once inhabited by lizardfolk, were left for ruin in this time.\n\nWe can’t let this fear of the deep ocean rule our senses. We are the Final Empire! We will rule the islands once again."

 #Before
 khatalashya_approve_examination_title: "Approve Examination"
 khatalashya_approve_examination_desc: "Examination of Kus an Zhyani has revealed wonders beyond our wildest imaginations. But what of the spire at Shalazar? What of Khankatesh? Could it not hold similar wonders? Our mages have wished to examine the spire in more depth for centuries, but what few examinations have been conducted in the past have unearthed little; the spire’s inner workings are inscrutable. This was not a worry in the past, but after we discovered the true purpose of the spire at Zerat, engineers and mages have been examining Khankatesh with greater scrutiny, attempting to make sense of its mysteries. We should give them full authority to study this spire. I am sure they will not be so foolish as to blow up the spire, as the Karrasian Empire did to the spire in Ashazual so many centuries ago."

 khatalashya_approve_examination_after_desc: "Examination of Kus an Zhyani has revealed wonders beyond our wildest imaginations. But what of the spire that once stood in Shalazar? What of Khankatesh? Could it not have held similar wonders? We have been plagued by the question of what happened to the spire ever since the one that stood there was revealed to be a fake. That was insult enough, but now that we know what secrets the spires hold, we can’t let this opportunity pass. We need to know what happened to the Shalazar spire."

 khatalashya_thraxi_patterns_title: "Thraxi Patterns"
 khatalashya_thraxi_patterns_desc: "The Thraxis is the highest and most important of all the Araizary. It has accompanied the lizardfolk ever since the second empire, when it helped their civilisation recover from the ruin of the first empire. Its importance is best exemplified by its presence on our flag, representing eternity. Yet the last time anyone spoke with or heard from the Thraxis was thousands of years ago during the 318th Empire, and all it did then was bless a local tchoken ranch. Some scholars of the 333 empires theorize that the Thraxis was killed during the Greenblight, a terrible period when dragons and draconic creatures roamed Taneyas.\n\nThe truth to the matter lies in the stars. The Thraxis is not one being, but a collection of smaller thraxi - araizary made of stars. Thraxi appear and disappear according to the patterns of these stars. Each tribe typically associated themselves with one star pattern and, by extension, one thraxi. If we can learn how to track the stars, we can track the thraxi, and eventually summon the Thraxis itself. The only problem is looking at the stars for too long can cause…issues."

 khatalashya_the_plane_of_earth_title: "The Plane of Earth"
 khatalashya_the_plane_of_earth_desc: "There has been much debate over the message left when the Zatsarya in Shalazar collapsed. The prevailing opinion is that genies took the spire and created a replica to stand as a mockery in its place. Genies have not roamed Sarhal since the Day of Ashen Skies, once again proving that all other races on this planet will crumble while the lizardfolk remain eternal. Yet it still feels humiliating that for thousands of years our people have been revering a false spire.\n\nA new question has emerged though from this line of thinking: Does the original still exist? The final message seemed to imply it did. Somewhere through the portal to the Plane of Earth, the true spire still stands. Our miners and engineers have gradually improved operations to extract resources through careful expeditions into the Plane of Earth. It is now time to send a deeper expedition. Find this genie who took our spire, and get it back!"

 khatalashya_summon_the_thraxis_title: "THE THRAXIS"
 khatalashya_summon_the_thraxis_desc: "The results from the thraxi observatory are in. There is a very narrow band of time when the stars are in alignment that this summoning ritual will work. As Agradent is in retrograde, as the thraxi are active, the right conditions have been reached such that we can call to the stars and bring It down. The being upon our flag, the most senior of all araizary. The one that has looked over our kind from the second empire onwards. It’s time to\n\nSUMMON\n\nTHE\n\nTHRAXIS"

 khatalashya_lupulan_the_lizard_spirit_title: "Lupulan: The Lizard Spirit"
 khatalashya_lupulan_the_lizard_spirit_desc: "We’ve become quite adept at spotting Precursor handiwork, so when we entered the temple in Haless, we knew straight away what it was we were looking at. This structure was built by the elves. Our early examinations have deduced that it appeared to be keeping the great lizard spirit locked away. The elves must have feared this great lizard spirit as it reminded them of us, their greatest foe. No elves will be able to stop us now though, and Lupulan can be free once more. Now, how do you open this thing…"
 333_earlier_rending_tt: "I’m sure Rending this temple apart will have no adverse consequences"
 333_appease_big_ghostly_lizard: "We will be able to converse with Lupulan"

 khatalashya_precursor_experiments_title: "Precursor Experiments"
 khatalashya_precursor_experiments_desc: "Dragons left Aelantir long ago. Any attempts by the Draktaya lizardfolk to find them has turned up nothing. But interest in draconic revenge has long faded in significance beside the possibility of learning what happened between our ancestors and the Precursors.\n\nAn expedition has discovered a building in Aelantir that bears an eerie resemblance to the Zatsarya in our homeland. A great spire with inner workings similar to that of the spire in Zerat. It appears that this one has been intentionally sabotaged, so our attempts to turn it back on have proved ineffective, but bigger mysteries lie in some core design elements. This was not built by lizardfolk. This was built by elves. Did lizardfolk build this for precursor elves? What happened then that meant lizardfolk society collapsed while elven society continued until the Day of Ashen Skies?\n\nIn amongst the old precursor records, we may have found the answer - or more accurately, where we can find our answer. The records speak of a joint construction project between lizardfolk and elves somewhere in the Ocean of the Lost. On an island somewhere stands a symbol of lizardfolk and elves working together to build something incredible. We must find it."

 khatalashya_beyond_the_stormwall_title: "Beyond the Stormwall"
 khatalashya_beyond_the_stormwall_desc: "While in the past we may have been reluctant to admit the Precursor Elves had reached levels completely beyond our capabilities, the Final Empire does not have such insecurities; for the Precursor Empire collapsed with no hope of ever reforming, while our own is eternal. Their destruction of the 271st Empire is just a part of history now. We will reach their level, it is simply a matter of time. It is why we can look at their creations and marvel at the sheer scale of their ingenuity.\n\nWe have scoured Aelantir for as much elven knowledge as we can, but with the dropping of the Stormwall, yet newer lands have appeared with a cornucopia of potential precursor relics waiting to be unearthed. We know of this land’s name from the records across precursor archives. On Serenbór, in the Pillar of Heavens, they speak of these lands where incredible experiments were run. Manufacturing life, creating beasts of war.\n\nInsyaa."

 khatalashya_the_golden_scales_title: "The Golden Scales"
 khatalashya_the_golden_scales_desc: "In the records found at the Spire of the Lost, the elves referred to the lizardfolk as the Golden Scales, due to a unique form of gleaming armor that was our ancestors wore - or perhaps it was a natural coloration that was wiped out? It is unclear, for the Precursors had surprisingly little interest in understanding our biology, especially when compared to the study of the Zatsarya.\n\nStill, it was clear that some study of lizardfolk was conducted after the war, although to what extent is unclear. There are records of a being called a Wishcatcher they seemed especially interested in, but the details are scattered. We have been able to piece together maps of Aelantir from before the Ruin though, and believe we know where research of lizardfolk and biological research was done. One was in a mysterious land called Insyaa. The other was in what today is known unflatteringly as the Leechdens. We should explore both of these places further. Perhaps they contain clues. Not just to what happened to us after the war, but also whatever clues the elves may have uncovered about our own biological makeup."

 khatalashya_empire_of_stars_title: "Empire of Stars"
 khatalashya_empire_of_stars_desc: "In a meeting to decide what next to ask the Thraxis, one naga suggested asking about the 12th Empire, about how accurate our histories of the period are. The naga in question, who hailed from Shalazar, had maintained an almost century-long argument with another naga from Zerat about the true nature of this empire. Nobody else present had even the slightest interest, but the seniority of said naga meant the idea was submitted to be discussed as an option. Only when the subject could be evaded no longer did the $MONARCHTITLE$ say what the rest of the group had been thinking: nobody really cared about the 333 Empires any more.\n\nWe have gone beyond the stars. We have questioned the very nature of the universe. We have learned how to control our own mutations, picked fights with genies, outlasted the Precursors. We lived on other planets. The only people who still brought up debates were those holding grudges over slights and insults. The bickering over whether the 12th, or the 130th, or the 158th, or any empire really existed feels so petty and meaningless when we live amongst the stars."

 khatalashya_the_prophecy_is_true_title: "The Prophecy Is True"
 khatalashya_the_prophecy_is_true_desc: "Lizardfolk civilizations have risen and fallen. The jungles of Taneyas are littered with their remains; their glories, accomplishments, and failings. Three hundred and thirty two empires across a hundred thousand years. New dawn after new dawn, collapse after collapse. A great empire will rise, only for it to inevitably fall as the sun sets.\n\nBut not us. For the prophecy has come true. The cycle has been broken. The 333rd empire is here. The Final Empire: Khatalashya! We shall take our place amongst the stars where no light ever fades, for our empire shall be eternal."

 khatalashya_the_records_of_shangra_title: "Records of Shangra"
 khatalashya_the_records_of_shangra_desc: "The lizardfolk script is written in nine different colors, each with its own grammatical meaning, making it somewhat difficult for anyone other than the very learned to parse. A simpler version was devised some years ago that only used four colours that could be used by merchants. In our weaker moments, one wishes this simpler writing style had not been created, for it has allowed erroneous understandings of Anzalkatsa to spread. Ideas about how many empires there have truly been, and how many of these historical empires may in fact be nonsense. In even weaker moments, we wonder whether these heretical preachers are correct…\n\nNo! We are looking at this all wrong. This simpler language is a tool, not a curse. Control the language and we can control the message. If we can formulate rejoinders to every calumny of false empires before uproar can begin, we will be prepared to combat these falsehoods. To do so, we need absolute control over the records of Shangra. The catacombs contain historical records dating back thousands upon thousands of years. It’s there where details of many historical empires lie. Often it is from Shangra that the seditious ideas emanate in the first place, as though being able to directly read these texts is what highlights their contradictions. If it lies purely under the control of the naga, these ideas will stop spreading…hopefully."


 khatalashya_assert_naga_dominance_title: "Assert Naga Dominance"
 khatalashya_assert_naga_dominance_desc: "The final, prophesied empire has been declared. A joyous occasion, surely?\n\nNo, say the peasantry. They doubt us. They doubt the naga. How on earth could one possibly reliably count 333 empires? They say this is all a conspiracy by the naga. Nobles, merchants, adventurers, mages, inventors; so many demand for more say in how this empire is run. This empire was prophesied by the naga. It was delivered under the guidance of the naga. It shall be run under the watchful eyes of the naga, for now and forever. For this empire is forever, as too is the will of the naga."
 khatalashya_assert_naga_dominance_tt: "Current ruler needs to complete at least 2 §YNaga agendas§!. Currently completed §Y[ROOT.count_church_agendas_current_ruler.GetValue]§!"

 khatalashya_aelantir_lizardfolk_title: "Aelantir Lizardfolk"
 khatalashya_aelantir_lizardfolk_desc: "The discovery of Aelantir and the records of the Precursors have allowed us to connect the pieces of so many parts of our history. The ancient empire the 271st Lizardfolk Empire fought was was clearly the Precursor Elves. We also now have context for lizardfolk empires that existed before the Precursor Elves overthrew the dragons. For there were lizardfolk in Aelantir once.\n\nNot many, it must be said. The 118th Empire was in Aelantir, although its reputation as an "empire" is controversial, as it is unclear whether this empire had any more than 5,000 inhabitants. There were also empires like the 73rd that sailed to Aelantir to defeat the dragons, only to be defeated themselves. They were known as the Draktaya, or Dragonslayers. They are the empire whose legacy we will emulate. We come here to conquer and to rule. To destroy any last draconic influence in Sarhal or Aelantir, and find the truth of what happened to them."

 khatalashya_summer_isle_lizardfolk_title: "Summer Isle Lizardfolk"
 khatalashya_summer_isle_lizardfolk_desc: "Halflings have never garnered the same ire amongst lizardfolk that the humans have. Relations have been positively cordial between our two peoples.Yet lizardfolk on the Summer Isles living under the rule of halflings has always felt wrong. It was not always this way, however – the Itayzemby Lizardfolk once sat in positions of power across all corners of the islands.\n\nDrawing from a tactic deployed by the 316th Empire, we have struck on a way to increase lizardfolk presence on the islands. Usually lizardfolk families do not keep every egg from a clutch. The smallest and frailest are discarded, eaten, or sent to the temple to be raised there, as few families can afford to rear every clutch. We should send these smallest eggs to hatch on Tsamanosy. Not only will this increase lizardfolk presence and power over the island, but their short stature as runts of the clutch will instead be right at home amongst the halflings."

 khatalashya_spire_of_the_lost_title: "Spire of the Lost"
 khatalashya_spire_of_the_lost_desc: "We have found our lost spire, on an island so deep in the middle of the ocean that no maps catalogue its existence. The elves called it Serenbór, a Bridge to the Stars… for that is what the elves and the lizardfolk were working together to build. A great spire that could take them beyond the heavens. Yet clearly it wasn’t finished. We need to know why. We need to know the truth."

 khatalashya_the_pillar_of_heavens_title: "The Pillar of Heavens"
 khatalashya_the_pillar_of_heavens_desc: "As much as it pains us to admit, the elves really knew what they were doing. The Pillar of Heavens is an incredible feat, on par with anything the first Lizardfolk Empire built, and beyond anything we can currently construct. Our wisest lizards have moved en-masse to the colonies (the Aelantir colonies that is, not the space colonies) to study this incredible structure. Our first goal was to see if we could activate it again, but it appears whatever location on the other side is not accepting its activation, or at least that is the current main theory.\n\nWhere we have had greater success is by analysing the structure itself. The precursors left behind construction details on the Pillar of Heavens, albeit with many of the details lost or indecipherable. It has taken a long time, but we think we may be able to build parts of a new Zatsarya ourselves, so long as we have most of an existing base to work from. Thankfully, Sarhal has a number of these partially constructed Zatsarya. The Irikin spire, the shattered remains at Ashuzual, the spire-turned-citadel in Kuvunika… each of these have most of the main parts already in place. With the full power of the state, we can rebuild them."

 khatalashya_the_wishcatcher_title: "The Wishcatcher"
 khatalashya_the_wishcatcher_desc: "Never before has a new lizardfolk’s hatching attracted such attention. As it cracked through the shell, its wide eyes peered at the naga, then to the doctor, then to the magical torch the naga was holding to illuminate proceedings, before its tiny hands pushed the pieces of shell aside. It flopped onto the blanketing, breathing rapidly as it recovered from such a monumental effort, an ordeal every new hatchling goes through. The doctor picked up a blanket and wrapped up the small creature, until only its small head peered out from underneath. The hatchling peered around the crowd again, from naga to doctor to the magical torch, before it opened its mouth and unfurled a large, delicate frill around its face. In an instance, the magical torch went out.\n\nWe’d done it. This hatching was a being so powerful it once scared even the Precursors and the Genies. For the first time in almost 10,000 years, they had returned.\n\nA Wishcatcher."

 khatalashya_investigate_every_lizard_title: "Investigate Every Lizard"
 khatalashya_investigate_every_lizard_desc: "Deep in the being of every lizardfolk lie the memories of every lizardfolk before them. Somewhere, locked deep inside the structure that makes up their being, is the key to every mutation that ever existed. We need to examine as many lizardfolk from every corner of our empire - no, of Halann - to see if we can unlock the secrets to old mutations. Maybe, somewhere deep inside all of us, lies the secret to this mysterious Wishcatcher."

 khatalashya_a_new_capital_for_naga_title: "A New Capital for the Naga"
 khatalashya_a_new_capital_for_naga_desc: "Our choice for administrative centre for the Final Empire has started to cause fractures in our coalition. Discussion on which center would be the “correct” choice for a capital gets bogged down in endless debate because every historic lizardfolk city considers their city to be the most important. You would think the naga, in all their wisdom, could rise above the ruckus. But naga too have their loyalty to their hometowns and have not been able to leave aside their biases to make an objective decision. To choose a new capital, we need one that all naga can agree on, and there is one potential location.\n\nYou see, the humble and profoundly stupid tchoken is the food of the masses. It has fed lizardfolk for as long as there have been lizardfolk. No naga is above a good roast tchoken leg. But if there's one delicacy a naga enjoys above that of the succulent tchoken, it would be a fish from Lasadza Fish Market. It would make the perfect new capital, and every naga would relish the chance of living closer to the source of such a delicacy."

 khatalashya_two_hubs_of_naga_title: "Two Hubs of the Naga"
 khatalashya_two_hubs_of_naga_desc: "The two greatest cities of lizardfolk in Shalazar and Zerat have historically also hosted the greatest council of naga across Taneyas. Unfortunately these two hubs of naga have grown apart over time, not helped by the centuries where the cities were separated by the bloodcursed Ashhana. This has led to the Rhada naga of Shalazar and the Ichiadza naga of Zerat forming very different opinions of how society should operate, how leaders should act, and how to direct our people.\n\nWe need to stop this factionalism amongst the naga. There already exist dissenting voices amongst the populace as to the validity of the 333rd Empire prophecy. If we do not present a united front from the naga, this will only fuel the conspiracies and weaken our ruler’s position, as they will be forced to constantly balance the trust of the two factions."

 khatalashya_under_kus_an_zhyani_title: "Under Kus An Zhyani"
 khatalashya_under_kus_an_zhyani_desc: "Overlooking Zerat, the city between the lakes, stands Kus An Zhyani: the greatest of all Zatsarya. Where other spires have been worn down, damaged, blown up, cursed, sunken, or gone missing over the millennia, the spire of Zerat stands as unblemished as it did during the days of the first empire. It is a testament to the longevity of lizardfolk civilisation. As long as it stood, the prophesied empire would arrive.\n\nNow that the Final Empire is here though, the naga have been facing repeated questions by the ruler and his non-naga advisors. Is it not time to explore Kus An Zhyani? Understand the messages left by the First Empire? What is its purpose? Why did the gods show them how to build it, and what is its purpose? Is it time to break with thousands upon thousands of years of tradition and let more than the spire’s guardians inside?"

 khatalashya_the_shadowroot_title: "The Shadowroot"
 khatalashya_the_shadowroot_desc: "The Night Hags of Yezel Mora have terrorized the lizardfolk since they arrived shortly after the Day of Ashen Skies, year 1 of the modern calendar. Terrifying though they may be, in the grand scale of lizardfolk history, that is but a blip on the timeline. Their power is but a fraction of some of the most terrible creatures that have collapsed lizardfolk society over time. The 271st Empire, the most advanced lizardfolk empire since the very first, was destroyed by magical beings from across the ocean. There are also the many lizardfolk empires that were brought to ruin by the mythical being known only as Tchazara, including the 85th, 99th, 100th, 120th, and 121st.\n\nThe Night Hags are just another in the long list of powerful beings the lizardfolk eventually overcame. They cannot collapse this empire, for this is the 333rd Empire, and our reign is eternal. The swamp was once home to lizardfolk too, before those hags took control. It will belong to lizardfolk soon once again."

 khatalashya_empires_outside_taneyas_title: "Outside Taneyas"
 khatalashya_empires_outside_taneyas_desc: "The great cities of Taneyas have been the centers of most of the lizardfolk empires, and for centuries this place has been our home. But obviously lizardfolk have not just stewed in these jungles for a hundred millennia. The empires between the 35th and 42nd that existed across the sea in Haless; the desert empires of 234th to the 243rd that stood in the Salahad; the 118th Empire that was in what today we know as Aelantir: from the genie coast to the coffee coast, deep in the Shadow Swamp to the Summer Isles, lizardfolk have made many different corners of this planet our home.\n\nIt’s time to move outside Taneyas. Claim and reclaim all previous homes of empires past. Taneyas cannot contain the Final Empire. Even Halann will struggle to contain our inevitability."

 khatalashya_naga_bureaucracy_title: "Naga Bureaucracy"
 khatalashya_naga_bureaucracy_desc: "Endless administrative work flows through the halls of governance in Khatalashya. It has increased the workload of the $MONARCHTITLE$, leaving little room to concentrate on external matters of war, colonisation, diplomacy, and so on.\n\nWhen one finds oneself in troubled times, one can always turn to the previous 332 empires and see what we is to be learned from them. For this we turn to the 167th Empire, whose complex and sophisticated bureaucratic system was developed over centuries to the point where the bureaucracy could function with no oversight from the ruler. It got to the point where the king abdicated in fury over his apparent lack of purpose and handed the crown to a tchoken, yet the empire remained running for the next 80 years under tchoken royalty.\n\nThe lesson from this is not that we could put a tchoken in charge – Said empire did eventually collapse after all, and ours will never – instead the lesson is that a functioning bureaucracy can free the $MONARCHTITLE$ from internal responsibilities and allow them to focus on the big picture."

 khatalashya_genie_coast_lizardfolk_title: "Genie Coast Lizardfolk"
 khatalashya_genie_coast_lizardfolk_desc: "Of all the greatest enemies of lizardfolk, dragons stand at the top. In second place, though, once stood the genies. They took great delight in crushing many a historical lizardfolk empire. The 313rd Empire in Madriamilak, the 239th Empire in the Shadow Swamp, the 137th, the 307th – so many lizardfolk lives ended at the hands of the genies.\n\nAnd yet we know that once they feared us. The 271st Empire, possibly the third greatest of the historical empires, after the first and our own, scared the genies out of all lizardfolk territory. Their greatest cities stood in what today is called Dao Nako: the Genie Coast. At the Zatsarya of Kazakesh stood a tremendous city, until it was sunk into the earth and lizardfolk were chased from these lands by genies and humans alike. What lizardfolk remain here live a downtrodden existence, forced into hiding by the humans who would oppress them.\n\nRestore the city of Kazakesh. Restore the Shyashkay lizardfolk culture of Dao Nako. We are the Final Lizardfolk Empire. All lizardfolk will come under our reign, and all lizardfolk will prosper under our rule."

 khatalashya_mutations_outside_taneyas_title: "Mutations Beyond Taneyas"
 khatalashya_mutations_outside_taneyas_desc: "As much as we like to pretend the massive variety of mutations amongst lizardfolk has always been accepted as natural, in reality some of the more extreme mutations were more reluctantly accommodated than happily embraced. Not every mutation variant commands the respect the naga gets for instance, for not all mutations have the power of the naga, both culturally and magically. However, as more lizardfolk move outside the jungles of Taneyas, we’ve started to see more mutations appear.\n\nSome Taneyas lizardfolk have developed prejudices towards these new lizardfolk, calling them not “true” lizardfolk. This is an insidious belief, as if this idea takes hold, even mutations born within Taneyas can be rejected, if they do not conform to the vision of what a “true” lizardfolk looks like. We cannot allow this narrow view of what a lizardfolk is to take hold. We are the empire to rule all lizardfolk. This is a central part of the prophecy: not a specific kind of lizardfolk, but all lizardfolk."

 khatalashya_precursor_research_desc: "The records at the bottom of Kazakesh have opened the door to so much lost knowledge. These are from the 271st Empire, the most advanced lizardfolk civilisation until our own. They could tell that the spire had a technical purpose. They worked together with the Precursor Elves to try figure out what its purpose was. Yet to the best of our knowledge, they weren’t able to uncover its secrets.\n\nWe, however, have uncovered the secrets of Khus an Zhyani. We know the Zatsarya are teleporters that can send you to an unknown world. We believe Kazakesh can too send us to a different part of Romutha, allowing us to explore more of this strange land. Despite being buried underground, the spire appears as though its insides are fully functioning. If we follow the same process as we did in Zerat, we can activate Kazakesh too."

 khatalashya_agradent_materials_title: "Agradent Materials"
 khatalashya_agradent_materials_desc: "The discoveries on the planets of Agradent and Romutha are astonishing. Ores and metals found rarely on Halann are abundant on Romutha. Agradent is littered with old Precursor Elven artefacts and knowledge. Our engineers have been salivating over what we can do with these materials in near-unlimited abundance.\n\nWhat has perplexed our researchers the most though is the presence of lizardfolk on these other planets - or in the case of Agradent, lizardfolk ruins. They must date back to the first empire, for that is when the spires were built. But what of all these other spires? Do they all go to other planets? Was Halann the origin point of all interstellar travel, or was Halann not the original? Something before the First Empire. Something not of Halann.."

 khatalashya_mutation_investment_title: "Mutational Investment"
 khatalashya_mutation_investment_desc: "The more lizardfolk move to different lands, the more we realise how much variance in mutations there can be. It’s not just random – mutations are often reactions to the environment itself. This raises profound questions of the degree of control we could potentially exert over our mutations. We historically considered each mutation a gift from the gods that could not be predicted, but by now we know there is some level of intentionality in the process. Let us say we took all the strangest and most unique mutations across Taneyas and started experimenting. Could we move the eggs of mutated lizardfolk out of their homeland and still have them be born with the correct characteristics? If we move a naga egg to Romutha, will it hatch differently?\n\nIt is staggering how much we don’t know about ourselves. We don’t even know where we’re from, how we got here, why we change, and so much more. The more we learn about ourselves, the more we realise how little we truly know."

 khatalashya_a_spire_between_planes_title: "A Spire Between Planes"
 khatalashya_a_spire_between_planes_desc: "We found the spire in the Shadow Swamp!\n\nObviously we knew that there were once more Zatsarya. They can be damaged after all, and have stood for tens of thousands of years. But what became of those other spires? For the most part, we understood them as being completely destroyed and their component parts carted off to different parts of the continent. In some cases they were swallowed by earth and lava, as was the case for the one destroyed during the 223rd Empire.\n\nBeing buried by lava though is one thing. Lava could probably melt even a Zatsarya. Swamp water though? Surely no Zatsarya could be destroyed by that. We already have an example of a spire remaining perfectly preserved after being swallowed by the earth. Kazakesh, the spire on the Genie Coast, worked just fine.\n\nAfter extensive expeditions, the shadow spire was uncovered, in the end not by any prospector but by a simple tchoken farmer. In Tovhichesu, the tip of a spire is visible, fading in and out of sight. It appears to exist between two planes at once, although its connection to the shadow plane is fading. Pulling it out of the earth will be the most difficult task, but once we do, there will be no greater sign of lizardfolk control over the Shadow Swamp than resurrecting a great Zatsarya at its centre. I wonder what planet this one leads to?"

 khatalashya_space_naga_title: "Spacefaring Naga"
 khatalashya_space_naga_desc: "Naga are creatures of routine and tradition. It is they who guide the people to live virtuous lives according to Anzalkatsa. It is they who pronounced the 333rd Empire and that the prophecy had finally been fulfilled. Naga are integrated into every aspect of the running of Khatalashya.\n\nAnd yet in these heady days of space travel, the naga have felt like control has been slipping through their fingers. Trying to guide the lives of space colonies from Taneyas feels impossible. Are they living true to the teachings of Anzalkatsa, so far away from the homeland?\n\nNaga too must move with the times. Eternity does not stand still. There needs to be permanent naga headquarters in every one of our space colonies. No more of these special naga envoys, reluctant to leave their homes on the shores of Lake Lasadza. Romutha needs its own naga; so too does Agradent; so too does every planet where lizardfolk now make their home. We cannot fear that a spacefaring naga’s interpretation of Anzalkatsa may drift from those on Halann, for the interpretations of Anzalkatsa doctrine will shift an infinite amount of times in the infinite time of the Final Empire."

 khatalashya_space_mutations_title: "Mutations Beyond Halann"
 khatalashya_space_mutations_desc: "New mutations have been appearing across every space colony. There are now lizardfolk on Romutha capable of drinking the black oil on that planet and breathing fire, using it as fuel. Others on Agradent have developed legs similar to that of a cricket, allowing them to jump astonishing distances. Attempts to integrate all of these mutations into our military have not gone well. Taneyas commanders have little experience with them and find it difficult to incorporate such a variety of lizardfolk into battle plans. We would be better off granting more autonomy to the colonies in matters of military organisation. They know how to use these mutations and get the best out of them during warfare."

 khatalashya_the_eternal_empire_desc: "We found it. Rakh. Our home. Our original home. Not just that, but we’ve found what could be the key to unlock not just a few new locations to explore, but the entire galaxy. We found the home of the First Empire!\n\nAlthough, at this point, even counting empires at this point seems odd… trivial, even. There are hundreds of worlds out there. Some of them will have had races like that of the Precursor Elves, who travelled across stars like our own forebears did. Many of these planets will too have lizardfolk. Many of them too will have seen the rise and fall of empires. Maybe some of them too reached where we did. They too believed they were the ultimate empire. They too reached Rakh. They too found home.\n\nAll of these empires too fell. The elves. The lizardfolk. The distant species who conquered entire worlds we may never know about. We cling to our idea of the Eternal Empire, like we too won’t be like every other species across the galaxy. Yet what can we cling to if not the prophecy?"

 khatalashya_the_underwater_spire_title: "The Underwater Spire"
 khatalashya_the_underwater_spire_desc: "The question of how to re-activate the spire of Arskitse has been a tricky subject for a while. It could be possible to haul it from the bottom of the ocean onto land, but dislodging it from the seafloor would be difficult without sending divers down to dig it up, and the merfolk would never allow us to do that. A full scale extermination of merfolk was not an option either, and fistfights had started when it was brought up in one meeting. Fortunately, we may have our solution. Shagatan lizardfolk are more than happy spending their entire lives underwater. Even lizardfolk with Taneyas parents, if their eggs are hatched on Shagatan, are born with the glidz mutation that allows them to spend hours, even days, underwater. They can repair the Zatsarya."

 khatalashya_mutations_controlled_title: "Controlled Mutations"
 khatalashya_mutations_controlled_desc: "It is amusing that humanity considers elves, orcs, dwarves, and harpies all as separate races from themselves. The mutations different types of lizardfolk can exhibit vary so incredibly wildly. Extra sets of arms, eyes, legs; massive hulking armored bodies that rival a troll in size to the small scuttling bodies of lizards near indistinguishable from kobolds. These are all lizardfolk, and all part of the Final Empire. Bring all mutation variations under our control and let them understand that all mutations of lizardfolk are part of the 333rd Empire."

 khatalashya_end_the_bloodcurse_title: "End the Bloodcurse"
 khatalashya_end_the_bloodcurse_desc: "The bloodcurse tore Taneyas asunder. Thousands upon thousands of lizardfolk, twisted by the curse of the Night Hag’s Coven, stampeded through the jungles and collapsed the penultimate empire. A tragedy, yes, but as an empire that is destined to last for eternity, we can take the long view on such a curse. The 332nd Empire was hardly the only empire to collapse due to a disease of some kind. The 19th Empire suffered from the Curse of Angels, under which its populace gradually faded out of existence. The 158th Empire collapsed in a pandemic due to eating too many tchoken. A curse like this will pass.\n\nThe issue is one of control. The bloodcurse causes the Ashhana to lose control of their mind and attack whatever is in front of them. If we can maintain full control over every Ashhana Lizardfolk in our borders, we can control every and any instance of a crocodilian lizard from falling to the red mist ever again."

 khatalashya_irikin_spire_title: "The Irikin Spire"
 khatalashya_irikin_spire_desc: "”Kuiika Gamyi” the humans call it. We know it’s true name. The Irikin Zatsarya. Standing proud in the wide open plains to the west of Taneyas, it was once home to the great Irikin Lizardfolk culture. The top broke off some indeterminable time ago, although we can surmise via the records of historical lizardfolk empires that it occurred sometime between the 51st and 102nd empires. Yet even despite that, its majesty is incredible. Even the humans know that, for they too worship it, though they naturally do not understand its true meaning. It was left for us. For the Final Empire.\n\nAdmittedly it appears the damage to it means it will never be able to be restored to its original purpose. Nevertheless, the symbolic importance of returning this spire to lizardfolk hands would signify we are ready to reclaim the plains and restore the lost Irikin culture."

 khatalashya_we_used_to_live_here_title: "We Used to Live Here"
 khatalashya_we_used_to_live_here_desc: "In the lizardfolk language, rakh has multiple meanings. Its most common use is for home, but it’s also a sense of belonging. You feel rakh when you know this place is your home. Nobody feels rakh in the Shadow Swamp. We know lizardfolk used to live here. There were even empires with their capitals here. As our early colonists attempt to make this place a new home for our expanding empire, that seems impossible to believe. Color drains the further you venture into the swamp. Even the brightest scaled lizard loses their vibrancy under its monochrome magic. The multicolored text in which we place such pride becomes nigh-unreadable in simple black and white.\n\nStill, there are some positive signs. Ever since we purified the Shadowroot Matriarch of the Night Hag’s torture, shoots of green have started appear on some trees. The shambling mounds that terrorise even the trolls appear to be fewer in number. Perhaps the most promising sign, however, is how utterly unfazed our farm’s tchoken are by the surroundings. Not a single bit of color leaves their body. If a simple tchoken can handle the swamp, then surely a race as resilient and resourceful as the lizardfolk can thrive in such an alien environment."

 khatalashya_new_irikin_mutations_title: "New Irikin Mutations"
 khatalashya_new_irikin_mutations_desc: "The emergence of a new mutation amongst the Irikin Lizardfolk has prompted us to examine all lizardfolk mutations with renewed interest. These dashirik lizardfolk amongst the Irikin lizards have evolved to be more comfortable in direct sunlight, with broader and wider legs better suited to travelling long distances over the plains. Records of past empires show that lizards with these mutations have existed in the past. This brings to bear a fascinating idea: could we tap into our beings and resurrect old mutations? Could we recreate old mutations with the right conditions?"

 khatalashya_shadow_lizards_title: "Shadow Lizards"
 khatalashya_shadow_lizards_desc: "The 333rd Empire may be set to last for eternity, but eternity is ever changing. Lizardfolk mutate and so do our beliefs. The idea that the Khaga Yatsa is cursed and should not be entered has lost much of its support amongst the populace. Many naga are…reluctant to shift their beliefs, and technically have the advisory power to convince the $MONARCHTITLE$ not to bow to the whims of this new consensus. But naga have not risen to such positions of political influence by ignoring the desires of their people. Besides, with the gasabi lizardfolk able to enter this cursed spire, the prospect of activating it feels so tantalisingly close. What worlds lie on the other side?"

 khatalashya_space_tchoken_title: "Spaceborne Tchoken"
 khatalashya_space_tchoken_desc: "Life on the planetary colonies can be harsh. Crop failure is a common occurrence, and a lot of food has to be transported to the colonies to keep them afloat. Endless open lands available for those seeking a new life sound exciting until you realise how unforgiving attempting to eke out an existence on these alien worlds can be. The colonies would have failed if not for one secret trick of the lizardfolk species.\n\nThe tchoken.\n\nIt adapts to any environment seamlessly. Its attitude to life does not change no matter whether the Halanni sun shines bright or the black ring of Romutha hovers ominously above. To be compared to a tchoken was once considered the greatest of insults: it meant you were stupid, ignorant, gormless, and slow. On the colonies, however, to be compared to a tchoken…well, it still usually is meant as an insult. But for some it is about resilience. About the ability to adapt to any surroundings. It represents what it truly means to be a citizen of Khatalashya. It doesn’t matter where in the world - no, the galaxy - you are. You will adapt. You will survive. You will thrive."

 khatalashya_tchoken_farms_title: "Tchoken Farms"
 khatalashya_tchoken_farms_desc: "The secret ingredient to our resettlement of the Shadow Swamp has been the humble and stupid tchoken. Where other crops failed and animals struggled, tchoken revelled in such harsh conditions, unblemished by the color-sapping environment and unfazed by the local dangerous fauna. You would think it bravery, had you not earlier that day been forced to rescue a sinking tchoken that had wandered into a bog and made no effort to prevent itself from sinking as it chewed on plants.\n\nAnd yet, despite this, our settlements in the Shadow Swamp, and indeed our glorious final, prophesied, 333rd Empire, run on tchoken. If the front of our flag proudly shows the Thraxis, then its back surely contains the bulbous eyes and stubby legs of the tchoken."

 khatalashya_empire_of_the_swamp_title: "Empire of The Swamp"
 khatalashya_empire_of_the_swamp_desc: "Lizardfolk lived in the Shadow Swamp as recently as about 1,500 years ago. The World Tree at its center has been written about as far back as the 34th Empire, which is when the earliest recordings of the Khaga Yatsa Zatsarya being cursed were made. There’s always been shadowy forces at play in the swamp, but it was habitable. It even prospered during the 312th Empire when Ahzdara Lizardfolk culture was at its height, a culture long since dead. It was the hags that made this place the horrific nightmare it became.\n\nThose days are long past us. All across the Shadow Swamp, the Ahzdara Lizardfolk culture has been reborn. Inspired pieces of art, incredible architectural construction, and some of the greatest modern minds are now born and made in the Shadow Swamp. More than anything though, the sense of rakh has returned to the lizardfolk of the swamp. Ahzdara, once again, feels like home."

 khatalashya_271_empire_desc: "Few empires loom as large in our history as the 271st, but that interest has dramatically increased with all the incredible discoveries we have made lately. At the bottom of Kazakesh lay an absolute treasure trove of information about this Empire. They were working together with the Precursor Elves to uncover the mysteries of the Zatsarya. What happened? How did their relationship sour? Did they successfully activate the spire? Did the elves not wish to share the secrets of Romutha, the lands beyond the spires?\n\nAs tragic as their collapse may be, this rise in awareness of everything the 271st Empire accomplished has created a revival of their culture. It is little more than role play, but lizardfolk have even started moving to Dao Nako, dressing in gold, and calling themselves Shyashkay Lizardfolk, in honor of the 271st Empire. The Golden Scales have returned to Kazakesh."

 khatalashya_colonial_naga_title: "Colonial Naga"
 khatalashya_colonial_naga_desc: "To say naga are important in Khatalashya is like saying water is important to a fish. But as our empire grows more sprawling, the naga who believe they can continue to oversee affairs entirely from Lazadzanazh look increasingly delusional. Before the days of Khatalashya, naga operated autonomously, supporting their tribe or village, only travelling to the local capital every few years to get guidance from the senior council of naga. Things have centralised across Taneyas, but once you go beyond these jungles, naga control has waned.\n\nWe need to stop pretending we can administer affairs in Fahvanosy and Dao Nako from Taneyas directly. We need to send more naga to these regions to assist local officials and rulers, and grant them powers to do what they feel is best for the region. If we can’t accept this for neighbouring regions, how will we ever keep control over lands across the seas in Aelantir, or even through the spires?"

 empire_333.1.t: "Faith in the Prophecy"
 empire_333.1.d: "How do we know there have been 333 empires?\n\nEver since the pronouncement of Khatalashya, this question has been raised, and the answers given by those in charge and the naga have not given satisfactory answer. For starters, these empires supposedly stretch back 100,000 years. That is a truly mind-bogglingly large amount of time. The amount of records we have from even the 330th Arskitse Empire are slim, most of it having been lost in the wake of the Onslaught, when many of their great cities were sunk beneath the ocean.\n\nThat was a little over 2,500 years ago. How could we possibly know about empires 25,000 years ago? Even what verifiable records we do have are written by a lizard who was copying a text that the interpretation of a painting done by an artist who heard from a hermit who spoke to a spirit that heard it from the gods themselves. It is a historical game of Yanshen Whispers where the message has surely been lost over time.\n\nThese issues could be alleviated if the stance was that the stories of the 333 empires are merely metaphorical. If they were fables, lessons one could take in how to properly govern a country. But if we were to accept that stance, then there is no reason why the 333rd Empire should be special. The entire prophecy is founded upon the central conceit that Khatalashya is definitely the 333rd Empire, and therefore destined to last forever. Should even one small piece of doubt enter the minds of its citizens, faith in the prophecy will collapse and the absolute right to rule will be challenged. The naga will not allow that to happen."
 empire_333.1.a: "You will not doubt the prophecy"

 empire_333.2.t: "Nonsense Empires"
 empire_333.2.d: "The issue of the 333 empires shows no signs in subsiding. If anything, the problems are only getting worse. Most lizardfolk only know about a few of the more famous empires. The 1st Empire, who were bestowed the spires by the gods. The 271st Empire, whose advancements frightened even the genies. What has been less publicised are the empires with more dubious historiography, and the entire prophecy risks becoming a laughing stock.\n\nTake, for example, the 55th Empire. It was simply a single hermit alone in his hut. He declared himself emperor and dared anyone to challenge him. When nobody spoke up, which naturally nobody did as he was completely alone, he pronounced the beginning of his “empire” and started detailing his exploits as emperor.\n\nThe fact that this empire is counted amongst the 333 is made all the more jarring by the fact Karassk was never considered an official empire despite ruling the entire eastern Sarhaly coast at one point. The explanation that it couldn’t be declared the 333rd Empire while the 332nd Empire of Zerat still stood doesn’t hold water when you consider that there have been times where multiple empires were active at once, including on occasion when six empires were all active at the same time. It is almost as though they were not declared the Final Empire simply because their King did not listen to the advice of the naga.\n\nFaith in the 333rd Empire will lie in its actions. Despite being eternal, we do not have eternity to assuage the doubts of the populace. If our reach can encompass all lizardfolk, if our influence stretches across the oceans and beyond even the stars themselves, then stories like that of the hermit will just become curious oddities of our foundational story rather than undermining faith in the prophecy."
 empire_333.2.a: "There have definitely been 333 empires"
 empire_333.2.tt: "We will get periodic events that drop our nation’s Faith in the Prophecy. Complete missions to restore Faith in the Prophecy."

 empire_333.3.t: "After Arkitse"
 empire_333.3.d: "The 330th Empire’s capital was in Arskitse, a great city that now rests underwater. The story goes that the emperor conducted an arcane ritual out in the middle of the ocean, and in doing so angered residents of the deepest underwater trenches. These Deep Devils rose up and invaded not just Taneyas, but the entire continent from the Divenhal to Ardimya, in an event known as The Onslaught. These Deep Devils sank many of their island cities to the bottom of the sea. Lizardfolk may be semi-aquatic, but they cannot live in an underwater city. Besides, after the monstrous creatures rose from the deep ocean, few lizardfolk were keen to enter the waters again. The cities were abandoned, with only the Arskitse spire rising above the sea as a reminder of what was once there.\n\nOver a thousand years later, these sunken cities were home to a new people: merfolk. Arskitse is now their home, as are many other sunken cities along the coast. Lizardfolk have long cultural memories, so we have little trust in a species that emerged from the seas. But Deep Devils the merfolk are not. Instead, a new theory has emerged.\n\nMerfolk are ruinborn.\n\nMerfolk only appeared in Sarhal shortly after the Day of Ashen Skies in the year 1. Though at first glance their fishy scales and long tails instead of legs might lead you to consider otherwise, they do bear a general elf-like appearance, including distinctive pointed ears. The discovery of degenerated ruinborn in Aelantir that have mutated far beyond what elves normally look like lends credence to the theory.\n\nThis is a controversial topic in merfolk society. To them, merfolk are merfolk, and not some other race. Some have even been ostracised and kicked out of their homes for trying to debate the topic.\n\nMany of these ruinborn-ancestry believers have banded together and approached us recently, asking for assistance. They wish to return to Aelantir and uncover the truth. Crossing the ocean as a merfolk is not feasible. But with the help of an above-sea ship, they could hitch a ride with us to Aelantir if we can secure them a new home."
 empire_333.3.a: "We will do our best to assist you"
 empire_333.3.tt: "If we or a subject control provinces in Aelantir in 5 years, we will get new Merfolk Settlements in Aelantir"
 empire_333.3.b: "Get there yourselves"
 empire_333.3.c: "We can bring you there now"
 empire_333.3.e: "Perhaps it is possible to use merbeasts outside of Sarhal?"
 empire_333.3.f: "It will be easy for us to set up new 'settlements' for them"

 empire_333.4.t: "Aelentir Merfolk"
 empire_333.4.d: "The theory that merfolk are ruinborn has grown amongst merfolk society, although in doing so it has only triggered yet more blowback. Merfolk societies are typically not eager to share any internal struggles with those above land, but we have gathered that there are entire villages worth of merfolk ready to leave for fear of persecution for their belief in the ruinborn theory. With our new holdings in Aelantir, we are ready to give them a new home."
 empire_333.4.a: "The land of the free"

 empire_333.5.t: "Stars in the Sea"
 empire_333.5.d: "Before Anzalkatsa, the primary lizardfolk faith was a mixture of worship of the araizary, and belief in the creator gods. Both araizary and the gods were symbolised in the stars. The proof of this was that attempting to discern the movements of the stars would afflict not just the observer, but everyone in their village, with a sort of sickness. Across Halann this is known as Astral Terror, an madness that occurs whenever one studies the night sky for too long.\n\nIn our hubris, we believed the Final Empire would be immune to this ailment –hat we could examine the movements of the constellations and summon the Thraxis back to Taneyas to tell it of our accomplishments. This was not the case. The observatories in Katala Raz and Odu Kherass have been destroyed. Torn down by their own occupants, driven mad by the skies, speaking of something that was watching them back. Not the Thraxis, though… something else. Something always out of your field of view. Something watching us.\n\nYet that did not occur to those at the island observatory. Instead of gazing through a telescope, they looked at the sea itself, using its reflection to gaze at the stars. The idea that this would solve Astral Terror was mocked. After all, telescopes too use reflections, as they are simply a series of lenses and mirrors. Perhaps it was not the reflections that saved us, but the araizary in the water?\n\nWhatever the reason, it must be studied further. For true breakthroughs have been made following the movement of the stars, the patterns of the thraxi, and the possible method by which we can summon the Thraxis. The araizary of eternity meets the Eternal Empire. We are so close."
 empire_333.5.a: "Divert all resources to the island observatory"

 empire_333.6.t: "Deep into the Plane of Earth"
 empire_333.6.d: "The Plane of Earth has no sky. The most comparable location would be the tunnels under the Serpentspine, but nothing could quite compare to the sheer strangeness our expeditionaries discovered there. The earth itself appeared to glow, giving the whole land a dim red light that illuminated proceedings. Rivers of mud flowed in upwards waterfalls, while formations of pure diamond kilometers across hovered in mid-air. The inhabitants were not typically hostile, although neither were they typically friendly. Mining expeditions tended to give any earth elementals wandering the plane a wide berth. If one had made its home next to a rich vein of coal, we had little option but to mark it on a map for future exploration and move on.\n\nThankfully, genie palaces were hard to miss. Their resplendent glory contrasted supremely with the ugly rock and earth that surrounded them. Hewn from ore and bright gemstones, each one stood out amongst the landscape and were used as markers in maps for explorers already.\n\nThe first expeditions had simply planned to mark every genie palace on the map as a place to explore later, but as luck would have it, we did not need to explore that far. Standing atop one genie palace, gleaming with greater beauty than even the palace itself, stood what we were looking for: A Zatsarya! It was pristine, a single complete piece with stars sparkling across its face. The path was drawn, the expedition returned, and our next expedition of 20,000 troops returned to reclaim our spire.\n\nIt was a disaster. “Look at these flies,” roared the lead genie, flicking her hand and wiping away every single weapon in our arsenal. “I think they want their spire back, how cute. These are the creatures you were once afraid of?” Another genie gestured their hand vaguely in the direction of the army, sending a cascading river of mud to wipe away the forces. “I told you, they once had wishcatchers. It was different. It was…”\n\nNobody heard the rest of the conversation. Only 12 lizardfolk returned."
 empire_333.6.a: "That went poorly"

 empire_333.7.t: "Tchoken in the Cursed Spire"
 empire_333.7.d: "Nobody enters the Khaga-Yetsa. It is cursed. It has been cursed as far back as the 33rd Empire. If you enter the spire, you die. The longest recorded span someone has stayed alive after entering the spire is twelve seconds. On one occasion, during the 34th Empire, what emerged was so monstrous it destroyed Taneyas so thoroughly that many lizardfolk fled across to Haless. With that warning in place, a strict perimeter has been placed around the spire for centuries, so that none even dare try enter it.\n\nThe job of guard of a spire that kills you can be quite boring, though. It is understandable that their minds may have wandered and they may not have noticed when something wandered into the spire. Not a lizardfolk, nor a troll or human nor halfling, but something much more mundane: a tchoken. The guards only spotted it as it sauntered brazenly into the open door at its front.\n\nCue utter panic. The second-most common form of empire collapse has been at the hands of a tchoken, a curious case indeed given there is nary a creature less threatening than a tchoken. For the 333rd Empire to potentially fall at the hands of a mutated monster tchoken would be the greatest embarrassment of them all. A full half hour of sheer panic was replaced by confusion when out from the spire wandered our defiant tchoken. But it was not alone. For accompanying it were a full family of tchoken, who had evidently been living in the spire.\n\nThis whole ordeal raised so many questions. It was well known that tchoken were typically unaffected by certain types of planar magic. It’s why their bright colors shone even amongst the monochrome surroundings of the Shadow Swamp. But for them to wander into the cursed spire of Khaga-Yetsa was something else entirely. Could the right mutation of lizardfolk also breach the cursed spire? On top of that, why were we still afraid? We are the Final Empire. If we truly believe we are eternal, then no monster can destroy our empire. We can conquer the mystery of the cursed spire as well. We just got our first clue."

 empire_333.8.t: "Usurpation of the Golden Scales"
 empire_333.8.d: "10,000 years ago, the elves of Aelantir overthrew their draconic masters. 2,000 years later, they encountered our ancestors and struck up a friendship over a mutual hatred of dragons and desire to share research. We were friends. Allies. We worked together to understand the mysteries of Halann. How did damestear work? What was the purpose of the spires in Sarhal? What was Astral Terror? The elves knew they wanted to reach beyond the sky itself, but whatever was up there was preventing them. They needed another way, and we both believed the answer lay in the spires.\n\nThe half-built spire on Serenbór was a symbol of this cooperation, or so our archeologists have been able to gather. While unsuccessful at restarting the spires in Sarhal, the two sides agreed to work together to construct their own spire using what knowledge they had gathered from Kazakesh. It was a symbol of our friendship, a mutual desire to understand the world and allow both peoples to thrive.\n\nBut something went wrong. There does not appear to have been a clear event. The answers remain scattered and unfocused. Some records blame lizardfolk for being uncomfortable building a mimic of what was granted to us by the gods. Other records blamed a mysterious being called the Wishcatcher, although what it did was unclear. Others simply spoke of not wanting to share the skies with "lesser" beings.\n\nThe resulting war was known as the Usurpation of the Golden Scales. The war was one of extermination. They cast aside our friendship and the 271st Empire, the greatest Lizardfolk Empire since the first, was destroyed."

 empire_333.9.t: "The Empire of Souls"
 empire_333.9.d: "For doubters of the 333 empires, the supposed Empire of Souls in Haless is a source of mockery. If every empire bar one between the 34th and 43rd Empire was based out of Haless, then why do no lizardfolk live there now? Why are there no lizardfolk ruins? Claiming it was tens of thousands of years ago is fanciful, as we have ruins of ancient empires across Taneyas. Were the buildings too spirited away?\n\nEver since the Merfolk Canal was built and journeys to Haless became easier, more and more lizardfolk merchants have been travelling to the continent, and word has been spreading of something that may indeed prove the Empire of Souls. As we understand it, each region of Haless is guarded by a great spirit. A dragon, an elephant, a carp, a fox. So, what is the great spirit that rules over the Lupulan Rainforest, the most natural habitat for lizardfolk on the continent? A lizard!\n\nThe coincidence is too great. It must know of the Empire of Souls. It must have come from the times of the Empire of Souls. As we quash any doubters of the 333 empires, we must gather definitive proof of their existence, and in the spirit of Lupulan we may have an answer."
 empire_333.9.a: "To Haless!"

 empire_333.10.t: "We Were Their Experiment"
 empire_333.10.d: "Precursor Ruins litter the Effelai. The presence of the singing jungle has dissuaded naught but the most determined, or suicidal, of explorers. The troves of relics and research facilities here are incredible, if one can push past the carnivorous plants and their seedthralls. Normally it is the facilities packed with relics that attract the most attention. Today though, it is a simple archive. A few elves once used this location to study a primitive species, making adjustments to their surroundings to see their response: removing troublesome pests who might interrupt their experiments, poking and prodding at their subjects and taking diligent notes.\n\nWe were those subjects. During the Usurpation of the Golden Scales, the elves did not just defeat us in battle. They continued fighting. Long after we had any ability to fight back, they continued to slaughter us. They destroyed our technology, our cities, our knowledge. They targeted specific mutations that they feared - the mysterious Wishcatcher - and ensured they killed every last one. In the interest of nothing but curiosity, they saw the many accomplishments of our great empire, and reduced us to using nothing but sticks and stones. And then they just watched. For a thousand years, watched us struggle.\n\nUsurpation? That is what they called it? Stare around this hideous jungle, at the leechmen that inhabit this land. At the ruin circle. At the relics of their empire. You usurped nothing. Your people failed. You blew all this up. We survived. Because the lizardfolk always survive. We were here before the elves, and we will be here long after the last elf dies. The Final Empire has always been destined to rise, and not even the Precursor Elves could stop it!"
 empire_333.10.a: "Just try to usurp us now!"

 empire_333.11.t: "Get Back Our Spire"
 empire_333.11.d: "The genie palace stood unchanged from when we last broached its entrance deep in the Plane of Earth. The Zatsarya at its middle stood gleaming and sparkling as vibrantly as the last time we saw it. The military detachment was smaller compared to last time we passed through the portal in Shalazar, yet more confident. This time the genies did not even notice the force until they had entered the grand palace gates. The first pair of genies spotted did not even speak, but merely waved a hand in the general direction of our army and continued their conversation.\n\nBut nothing happened. The army continued to march. The first round of soldiers started to prepare their muskets. One of the genies stared at their hand in confusion. The other peered at the army in disgust, until their eyes rested on a singular figure in our midst. Her expression shifted slowly from disgust to horror to sheer panic and, stumbling over herself, she screamed and ran. Fear too struck the second genie, but instead he stood up and shouted: “By the power of my wish, I demand you all to cease your existence!”\n\nThe air shimmered. Sparks shot from the genie’s hands and swirled above the army, before coalescing into a single stream and pouring down into the open mouth of a single, wide-frilled lizard. The genie did not move - he was frozen in place through nothing but abject terror. The last thing he could do before being riddled with musketfire was scream.\n\n“A WISHCATCHER!!!”\n\nWithin three hours, the entire palace had been occupied. Every genie had either been driven out, or been…eaten? It was not clear what happened. Musketfire could not kill a genie, but it did temporarily incapacitate them. Then the wishcatcher would approach the genie and it would simply fade, leaving behind nothing but a pair of curly-toed boots. Genies were supposed to be incapable of dying. They can only be bound or banished. But if their very essence of being was eaten, what happened?\n\nWhatever had happened, genies were no threat to our kind anymore. The spire could be returned to its rightful place in Shalazar. The being that so terrified both elves and genies had returned. No mutation could ever be wiped out again, for now we knew they could always be brought back. Every mutation is eternal. Our empire is eternal!"
 empire_333.11.a: "Take that, genies!"

 empire_333.12.t: "Inner Workings of the Zatsarya"
 empire_333.12.d: "Peering out over the great city of Zerat stands Khus an Zhyani. Many Zatsarya were gifted to the first lizardfolk empire by the gods, yet none remain as complete and unblemished as the spire in Zerat. In the stillness of the morning light, as the small crowd waited for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to speak, $MONARCH$ steeled their nerves. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] knew the statement they were about to make would cause controversy, not least amongst the naga. But it was time. They were the Final Empire. If not now, then when?\n\n”I am lifting the ban on entering the upper floors of this Zatsarya.” [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] next words were instantly drowned out by murmurs and shouts from the crowd. Several naga, including the leading figure in the current high temple, started to move forward, but $MONARCH$ continued.\n\n“The gods left us these spires to be used when we are ready. For as long as lizardfolk have dwelled here, we have not been ready. True, there have been no signs from the gods, nor anyone, that we are ready. But the Inheritance was left to us to discern, and we are the Final Empire!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stepped forward, pushing ahead of the naga that were slithering onto the stage.\n\n“We are the prophecy. There is nothing beyond our capabilities, because there is nothing beyond us. Will will uncover the mystery of the spires. For if we are eternal, then it is simply a matter of when.”"
 empire_333.12.a: "Begin the research"

 empire_333.13.t: "Appeasing Lupulan"
 empire_333.13.d: "The great lizard spirit towered over the rainforest, each leg as tall as a Zatsarya. Its giant teal-colored body glowed and illuminated the procession of lizardfolk below. It had originally not taken kindly to our presence. Although pleased to have been freed from the grasps of the temple, it viewed our actions here as unhelpful to solving the rampant spirit madness that had overtaken the continent since the start of The Rending of the Realms. It refused to answer any questions about historical lizardfolk empires until we had helped it. Now though, after granting its wishes, our entourage returned to the colossal spirit with the same question again: were there lizardfolk empires in Haless?\n\n“Lizardfolk did live here before.”. The spirit spoke in a deep, rumbling voice, speaking in the language of the natives of the rainforest. “I don’t know if they were an empire. That was none of my concern.”"
 empire_333.13.a: "That’s good enough for me!"

 empire_333.14.t: "Into Insyaa"
 empire_333.14.d: "This is where the branch of the Khatalashya story would have them explore Insyaa. On this hidden continent they would discover how much experimentation the Precursor Elves did with the creation of life, creating giant bioweapons in the process. Even the wisest lizardfolk in your retinue would barely begin to comprehend the science done by the elves here, but they’d be able to pick up on just enough. Enough to use Precursor techniques to reach into their own biological past. Enough to find a hidden gene that could restore long lost mutations. Enough to resurrect…\n\nBut for now, this text box is all you get. Perhaps in the future, you can return to Taneyas and relive the story of the 333rd Empire. Start with another of the pretenders to the crown of the Final Empire, knowing that your future experience will be ever so slightly improved by a populated Insyaa. Instead, you may return to your Khatalashya, for we know their story is entering its final act."
 empire_333.14.a: "Wait, who am I speaking to?"

 empire_333.15.t: "Why We Survive"
 empire_333.15.d: "Why do lizardfolk have so many mutations? It's for survival. Not every mutation will prove useful in the moment, but many more will. If we all looked the same, we would all die the same. This is how we lizardfolk keep coming back from the brink over and over again. There is always a mutation that emerges suited to the situation we find ourselves in.\n\nThis is why the Lizardfolk before us established themselves on so many different planets. It was for survival. Should something happen to the intergalactic transportation system, they knew they would have spread their people out to so many locations that some would still survive. One strain, one mutation, could revive the empire. That way the empire would never die. That way lizardfolk would never die.\n\nWe say there have been 333 lizardfolk empires on our planet of Halann. We don’t need to cling to that idea anymore. For now we know we are still part of that original galactic empire. They knew one of their kind would make it back to this spot and rebuild what was broken. We are not the 333rd Empire. We are the First Empire."
 empire_333.15.a: "The Eternal Empire"

 empire_333.49.t: "SUMMON THE THRAXIS"
 empire_333.49.d: "As the lights in the night sky lined up to the markings in the sand, each constellation glowed and began to fall, as though the sky itself was falling. Thraxi, each made up of thousands of stars, sank from the heavens. As each one reached the ground, it would join its brethren and spin together. Faster and faster as each thraxi joined the throng. More and more lights joined its ranks, the center of the whirring mass shining as bright as the sun itself. And then, with one brilliant flash of light, it stopped above the crowd. The symbol of eternity: the Thraxis.\n\nAt first many fell to their knees. The naga in attendance curled up in awe. Yet as the minutes wore on, an awkward silence descended over the crowd. Could the Thraxis speak? In records it had spoken, but this thing had no mouth. It was doing nothing but hover there. With a searing look from the head naga, the $MONARCHTITLE$ shuffled to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet and stood – before? – the Thraxis. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] started to speak. “To thee most resplendent of beings-”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was cut off by a voice, a voice that resembled like a million voices all speaking at once. “Hello dear, how nice for us to see you. It has been…time since we last spoke to one like yourself. Tell us, what is it you wish to know?” The voice was simultaneously comforting and terrifying, like a million unspeakable terrors tucking you into bed. The $MONARCHTITLE$ stuttered and stammered, realising [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not prepared for this. “Wh-wh-what can you tell us? How old are you?”\n\nThe Thraxis swirled in place for almost a full minute, before it finally responded. “We are older than time. We were here before you. Before dragons. Before genies. Before the skies and the seas and the land and all beyond. Your question is difficult for us to answer, as to have an age, we must have a birth date in time. That is something we do not possess.” The Thraxis spun in place for another minute before speaking again. “We enjoyed this visit very much. Do feel free to contact us again if you have any more questions. We will be-”\n\nRight at that moment, light from the sun spilled out over the jungle and onto the beach where the crowd stood. In that light, each star of the Thraxis faded, and before anyone knew what was going on, it was gone."
 empire_333.49.a: "They seem to like us, at least"

 thraxis_unlocked_tt: "Every 10 years the Thraxis will return, where you can ask it a new question about the mysteries of the world."

 empire_333.50.d: "As the stars descended, the constellations spun and whirred into the place; the Thraxis graced us with their presence once more. This time we were more prepared for the long silence before the whirling spiral of lights began to speak, and waited patiently for them to begin.\n\n“We are so pleased to see you again.” The voice of a million voices echoed around the clearing. “What is it you wish of us? Shall we bless a farm again? Or do you wish to hear a story? We have many interesting tales to tell, after all.”"

 empire_333.51.t: "Are the Gods Real?"
 empire_333.51.d: "“Yes”\n\nThere was a long pause as the lizardfolk waited for the Thraxis to elaborate, but it appeared to believe the single word answer was sufficient. Eventually one did ask: “So that means Raka Drakt and Naga-Katesh are indeed real? What about non-Lizardfolk faiths? The Cannorian gods, like Castellos. Or Elikhet, the god of the humans in Kheterata? Are they indeed fake?”\n\nThere was another long pause before the Thraxis spoke again. “We cannot speak to any individual god. It is easy for us to lose track of who or what gets called a god. Dragons have been worshipped as gods. Elves too. Angels, demons – even we have been worshipped as a god before. Their stories change over time and we struggle to keep track of truth from myth. We struggle with the evolution of stories over the passage of time, as time does not have meaning to us. What is now a god may have once been a demon, or a dragon, or a normal lizardfolk, or have simply been a fanciful tale.”\n\nThe crowd murmured and shuffled in their seats, the murmuring growing louder as neighbours grew animated in their disagreements with each other, before finally the Thraxis spoke again. “We would advise you not to worry about the reality of your gods, or any others. Believe in what you have created, for that is very real. Look upon what stories you told, what cities you built, and what art you created. Everything fades - well, everything but us. But those stories can last and carry your legacy. At the very least, we shall remember your story."
 empire_333.51.a: "Wise words"

 empire_333.52.t: "Going Crazy from Stargazing"
 empire_333.52.d: "There was a long silence after the question of what was in the sky was posed to the Thraxis. At first it seemed like it was just its normal pause it does after every question. But then it started to vibrate. The stars began to pulse red and its entire form started to jitter. Stars warped away from the being and were sucked back in as a million tiny voices cried out, each out of tune with one another. This continued for the better part of a minute, getting louder and more alarming as it progressed, the stars shooting out over the crowd and being pulled back in. Some onlookers screamed and hid, others just stared in awe, wondering if they had broken the Thraxis. You do not ask what is in the sky. We should not have asked. We should not-\n\nIt stopped. The pulsing, the screaming, the red flashes. The Thraxis was back to its normal position hovering above the crowd, its millions of stars slowly rotating.\n\n”We do not wish to speak of it.”"
 empire_333.52.a: "Sorry we asked"

 empire_333.53.t: "What are humans?"
 empire_333.53.d: "“Which ones are the humans again? Are they the ones with no scales and are about half your size?” There was a long back and forth between the lizardfolk and the Thraxis as they explained the difference between halflings, humans, elves, ruinborn, dwarves, and various other scale-less races. It was quickly clear that they were not going to get a satisfactory answer on why humanity were taking over the planet. But before the sun could rise over a disappointed crowd, robbed of their chance to question the Thraxis, it dropped one final nugget of wisdom.\n\n“We have seen many different races rise and fall on this planet. Elves, giants, lizardfolk, dragons, ytier, genies, celestials; so many others we do not remember the exact names of. It can be difficult for us to keep up. We did not realise the elves were considered to have fallen, although even we recognised the significance of the Ruin when it occurred. Humans are relatively new - even newer than the lizardfolk. We are sure that their fall shall occur, as it does with all peoples of the planet.”"
 empire_333.53.a: "The lizardfolk, however, will never fall again!"

 empire_333.54.t: "What is a Tchoken?"
 empire_333.54.d: "“A most delightful creature”, said the Thraxis, followed by a terrifying cacophony of voices that the crowd slowly realised was laughter. “We did wonder when it was that you would ask about it. It can be difficult for us to tell one lizardfolk from another across times, but we always know when we are speaking to a new person when you ask about a tchoken, for every lizardfolk eventually enquires about their kind.”\n\nThe Thraxis continued speaking, much more animatedly than usual, with none of their usual long pauses. “The tchoken have been here as long as you have. They have thrived as you have, suffered when you have, risen and fallen as your people have. We do not understand why so many speak of them with disdain, or why they do not feature more prominently on your emblems. While we are quite humbled that you have placed our form on your flag, we would have thought no creature had a greater bond with your kind than the tchoken. Perhaps it is so part of your society that you consider it part of this great empire you built, as much as any other lizardfolk? We hope that is how you see it, for to care for the tchoken is to care for yourselves.”"
 empire_333.54.a: "Number one tchoken fan over here"

 empire_333.55.t: "Shadow Swamp Lizardfolk"
 empire_333.55.d: "“That is a very broad question you ask of us, for the Shadow Swamp has had many inhabitants. Do you mean those who contracted the curse from the Night Hags, or the ones whose city and ancient spire sank into the bog? Or perhaps you speak of the toymakers who made the most delightful wooden tchoken? Or do you mean…did we say something untoward?”\n\nThe Thraxis had stopped talking, as there was a sudden tumult of exclamation and questions. The head speaker stood up and demanded the crowd settle down, before turning to the Thraxis. “Our initial question was indeed about those cursed by the Night Hags, but in doing so you have revealed something we wish to learn so much more about.”\n\n“We would gladly share more”, said the Thraxis, its million voice cacophony positively beaming with pride. “Each carving was about half the size of a normal tchoken, and was intended to be used by new hatchlings. They were coated in a special oil so the children would not get splinters and-”\n\n“Apologies, oh wise and venerable one, but it was not the tchoken carvings that interested us, but the sunken spire you spoke of. Of course, we would love to learn about the tchoken carvers afterwards”, the speaker hurriedly added, noticing the lights that made up the million stars of the Thraxis had started to dim. “But we were not aware of a spire in the Shadow Swamp, and such a thing would be an incredible find if we could locate it.”\n\nThe Thraxis remained silent for over a minute, with murmurs spread across the crowd. A lone voice called out – “Just let them tell us about the tchoken!” – before the Thraxis spoke again. “We do not know of its exact location anymore, for the paths through the swamp change over time, and it appears to have also grown in size. We do remember it was located to the west of the world tree. We are afraid that is all we can offer. As for the tchoken carvings, each one was painted ever so slightly differently...”"
 empire_333.55.a: "Not much to go off"

 empire_333.57.t: "Were there really 333 Empires?"
 empire_333.57.d: ""What is an empire dear?", asked the Thraxis. The head speaker started to answer, but their voice quickly faded as arguments amongst the crowds drowned them out. Of course. The question that had plagued Khatalashya’s legitimacy since its inception would inevitably start arguments before even the Thraxis had a chance to speak. Eventually the $MONARCHTITLE$, who always attended Thraxis hearings but usually took a back seat during questions, stood up and shouted over the crowd: "Quiet! If you truly wish to learn the truth, you will let that which has lived longer than every subject of our empire speak, for they offer wisdom far greater than any your minds combined could muster". The shouting stopped, although the low murmur continued as the $MONARCHTITLE$ turned and addressed the Thraxis once again. "In your own time, please do answer. As you have observed, this question has troubled our people for some time."\n\n"What counts as an "empire" is not clear to us", said the Thraxis, after its customary long pause. "We do not see the difference between one lizardfolk empire and the next. To us, you are lizardfolk. As we are a million voices speaking as one, the lizardfolk to us are a united body moving together. To us, you are still the first empire, for lizardfolk have never ceased to be, as so many others on this world have done so.""
 empire_333.57.a: "We’re still the First Empire?"

 empire_333.59.t: "War with the Precursors"
 empire_333.59.d: "“The lizardfolk have fought with many people. It can be difficult for us to tell when one war ends and another begins.” The tension, which had been high before the question, dissipated quickly as it seemed instead the lizardfolk would get a typically rambly answer from the Thraxis. That is, until it spoke again.\n\n“But they were different.\n\n”They did not stop. They developed…we can scarcely call them weapons. Tools of extermination. We don’t understand what happened, for before that the two sides were friendly. We did not see it all, for we dared not test what they could not kill.”\n\nThe crowd was deathly silent. This was not a tone anyone had ever heard the Thraxis use before. The voices it spoke with usually echoed around each other in a disconcerting cacophony, but this time each voice spoke as one in a deafening tone.\n\n”We are unsure if we have a beginning. Before meeting those elves, we believed we also did not have an end. After seeing what they did though, we changed our mind. If anything could end eternity, it would have been them. You have seen the evidence in what they did in Aelantir. All we can say about that is it was almost much, much worse.”"
 empire_333.59.a: "Terrifying"

 empire_333.61.t: "Lizardfolk on other planets"
 empire_333.61.d: ""How delightful! We are so glad to hear you have reunited with your brethren." There was an excited murmur around the crowd. "So they are indeed lizardfolk like us, then?" said the lizard who was tasked with the noble duty of speaking with the Thraxis. "When did our ancestors leave this world and establish new homes on other planets? Was this the first empire?"\n\nThe Thraxis paused, spinning in place for a while. "We don’t leave this planet. That which lives in the sky would not allow us to, and we do not wish to venture into one of those lovely spires of yours. This planet you speak of may have been visited by your kind before you even reached this world."\n\nThere was a short pause, but this one was interrupted by the crowd, who almost in unison started shouting new questions. Even the head speaker, tasked with both containing the crowd and conversing with the Thraxis, had temporarily lost her composure. Eventually, a naga hushed the crowd with a spark of magic lightning shot into the air, a violent crack. In the stunned silence, the naga in question broke protocol and spoke: "Are you telling us that lizardfolk do not come from this world?”\n\n"Did you not know?" asked the Thraxis, prompting another outburst from the crowd and another crack of lightning from the naga. "We would have mentioned it sooner if we had realised." The Thraxis seemed to realise that this statement had riled up the crowd, because its next words were spoken with a much softer tone - as soft as any tone spoken by a million voices could be, at least.\n\n"Your kind has a word. Rakh, do you still use it? We find it to be a lovely descriptive word. The word for home, but also the feeling of belonging. This may not be your original homeworld, but that does not make this land not your home. You do not need to have been born here. You have made this land your home, and it will remain yours for as long as you live here. It will also remain part of each of you who does leave this world. Think of it like the many new mutations your kind undergoes. Each mutation becomes part of your people. Each dead mutation remains part of your people. You are of this planet, and every planet of lizardfolk is part of you. You are all you are, and all you have been is part of you.""
 empire_333.61.a: "We’re aliens!?!"

 empire_333.62.t: "What is a Wishcatcher"
 empire_333.62.d: "“What a curious name. Is it perhaps some kind of charm or token to hang by one’s sleeping quarters.” The speaker slowly and calmly explained everything they had heard about the Wishcatcher: what the genies said, the message left by the fake spire in Shalazar, the various logs they had found written by the Precursor Elves. None of them seemed to be ringing any bells with the Thraxis. That is, until one person in the crowd mentioned that one of the Precursor messages spoke of “frills”, which caused the Thraxis to whirr back into life, its million voices calling out with renewed vigor..\n\n“Oh. That curious lizard! Yes, we do remember that being. A Wishcatcher, you call it? What a wonderfully evocative name. It did more than catch a wish though. It ate wish magic. By spreading its magnificent frilled mane, it drew in the very essence of a genie’s magic and devoured it whole. We believe there were more types of magic it could eat. It could perhaps even eat us, but it was far too polite to do such a thing. Of course those elves would be frightened of it - and definitely the genies. Their existence is one of wish magic. We do not know what would be left of them if you ate its wish. Perhaps its shoes would remain.”\n\nThe Thraxis span quicker and laughed at its own joke, the million voices laughing at different tones and paces, creating a din akin to being buried alive with a thousand beehives. But even its laugh could not drown out the excited chatter amongst the crowd. Something so strong even beings with power beyond our comprehension feared it..."

 empire_333.97.t: "A Meeting with the Thraxis"
 empire_333.97.d: "With no pressing questions that had to be asked of it, this meeting with the Thraxis was a much more informal affair. The Thraxis took questions from the audience, including some from children. Many of those in senior positions within Khatalashya didn’t even attend, something that was unheard of for the first few meetings. There was even a feeling amongst some that the Thraxis ultimately did not have much to offer the nation. Its answers were often meandering and seemed more concerned with small, irrelevant details and it rarely had answers to the big questions.\n\nYet amongst most the rest of the population, the Thraxis had become something of a spiritual guide. The Anzalkatsa religion, now increasingly detached from the prophecy of the 333rd Empire since that said prophecy had become true, had increasingly taken to following in the words of the Thraxis. Even many of the younger naga had taken more to following the words of the Thraxis over what the older naga taught, using its words to guide their own philosophy rather than the stories of past empires.\n\nAnzalkatsa, like Khatalashya, like Taneyas, and like the lizardfolk over and over again, was evolving."

 empire_333.101.t: "The 111th Empire"
 empire_333.101.d: "Naga cannot have children, nor do they experience romantic feelings or sexual urges. This can sometimes create a disconnect between a naga advisor and their student looking for advice in matters of love. Generally when it comes to relationships, naga focus on practical ways to maintain a positive relationship with a spouse or family through financial security or spiritual guidance. This works quite well, as a lizard in love can lose sight of more mundane matters and need a naga to pull them back to reality.\n\nWhere issues emerge though is when naga fail to recognise when someone is talking about romantic feelings. This has cropped up in an unexpected way when it came to the history of the venerable 4th Empire. According to naga chroniclers, the empire fell apart when trust between its people was crushed. But when the original text describing the incident was published more widely, the more likely interpretation of the text became clear: a metaphor for a relationship falling apart due to a cheating spouse.\n\nBy itself this wouldn’t be so damaging. But as more people started looking through the historical empires for missed romantic metaphors, the issue of the 111th Empire emerged. The text describing an incredible tower by a deep mineshaft with a flowing river was likely not talking about the city of Zerat, but a graphic sexual act."

 empire_333.101.b: "There are multiple records of the 111th Empire, not just the poem"

 empire_333.102.t: "The 121st Empire"
 empire_333.102.d: "No individual has been the cause of the demise of so many empires as the mythical being known as Tchazara. Nobody knows what she truly was. Theories range from a genie to a dragon to a corrupted Araizary, to simply being a cursed immortal lizardfolk who made it her eternal task to send the lizardfolk into despair. Multiple empires, starting with the 85th, died at her hands, only ending with her defeat at the birth of the 122nd Empire. During the birth of the 121st Empire, she cursed the crown that was about to be placed atop the first empress’ head at her coronation. When the crown touched her brow, the empire would be born, but it would also be shrouded in darkness and collapse at the same time.\n\nThis would not seem like a controversial inclusion into the 333 empires at first glance. Fantastical, yes, but nothing too out of the ordinary in the incredible thousand thousand years of the lizardfolk. Where the 121st Empire causes controversy is the fact it supposedly ended at the exact same time it began. There have been short empires before. The 91st Empire lasted 12 seconds, ending when a spear was hurled through emperor Haksal’s skull during his pronouncement speech. But can one truly say an empire existed if it died the exact moment it began?\n\nThe debate over the 121st Empire reveals the inanity of the 333rd Empire prophecy. For Khatalashya to fulfil the prophecy, there can be no doubts in any of the previous 332. A single doubt collapses the faith, so even fantastical details like Tchazara and the 121st Empire must be poured over to justify why they have been included."

 empire_333.103.t: "The 168th Empire"
 empire_333.103.d: "The Riven were an ancient enemy of the lizardfolk. They were a race of subterranean rat people who fought numerous epoch-ending wars between the 168th and 171st Empires. The records of these battles are remarkably complete, including detailed descriptions of the cities of the Riven, their locations, their advanced technologies, and even their language.\n\nThere is just one problem. Absolutely zero evidence of the Riven has been found anywhere else. No archeological finds of their under-cities, even at sites very clearly identified by the records. No other race has legends of a rat-like race. Their existence exists exclusively in these admittedly very detailed texts.\n\nSome have claimed that these texts are not historical accounts, but instead a series of novels in which the lizardfolk are invaded by an unknown enemy. Lizardfolk who claim this all live outside Taneyas, for fear of retribution from Anzalkatsa authorities, but unfortunately their writings have made their way back into the homeland jungles. It would be incredibly embarrassing should their claims turn out to be true, as it would cast doubt not just on these four empires, but call into question how many other supposed pieces of historical writing were also fictional."

 empire_333.104.d: "Treatises combating the prophecy of the 333rd Empire have been nailed to the doors across cities, from Zerat to Shalazar. One that has seen widespread publication claims the 172nd and 173rd Empires are just accounts of the same empire written by different historians. One considered them the embodiment of evil, the other the embodiment of strength, and their writings were so different that they were classified as two different empires.\n\nIn any normal time, it would not be controversial to merge these two empires into one, and even use this example as a learning opportunity in the inherent bias from which each historian writes – except that if you removed the 173rd Empire from the count, the current empire would no longer be the 333rd. Since that cannot be, the naga are forced to twist their snake-like bodies into knots explaining that the empire was split into two at some point and the 173rd Empire moved its capital to modern-day Shalazar, making it a new empire, so that it still counts."
 empire_333.104.a: "What a byzantine thought process"

 empire_333.105.t: "The 210th Empire"
 empire_333.105.d: "What creature has destroyed the most lizardfolk empires? The answer is, unsurprisingly, dragons, but what nobody expects is what comes in second. Not anything you would expect, like genies or elves or humans. Not anything from the Shadow Swamp, not the legendary crusher of empires Tchazara, not the being known simply as THE VOID. Instead the creature at fault for the death of the at least 25 different empires is the humble tchoken.\n\nDangerous is not a word typically associated with a tchoken. Stupid, clumsy, and gormless are more common adjectives. Blissfully unaware of their surroundings and born with a wind tunnel between the ears that never gets clogged with something as concrete as a thought, the tchoken lives in bliss. One of their most famous attributes is not recognising when they’re sinking into a bog, until only their round eyes remain above the surface. A tchoken is dangerous to naught but himself.\n\nSo why have so many empires died at the hands of a tchoken? According to prophecy doubters, it’s because whenever a writer wants to call someone pathetic, they say they died to the dumbest creature they can think of. It is a lazy writer's shorthand for weakness. So when the 210th Empire died due to a tchoken attack, it should be taken with a grain of salt. Same with the 45th Empire allegedly crushed beneath a herd of stampeding tchoken, a concept so comical even the most fervent believers in the prophecy find it difficult to explain."

 empire_333.105.c: "The records show tchoken were bigger in the olden days"

 empire_333.106.t: "The 241st Empire"
 empire_333.106.d: "Periods of lizardfolk history have seen the balance of power move away from Taneyas. From roughly the 230th to the 250th Empire, lizardfolk in Taneyas developed a long-lasting rivalry with lizardfolk who lived in the Salahad. They were a very unique type of lizardfolk, with mutations specifically suited to living amongst the hot sands. That these empires existed isn’t in doubt. There have even been discoveries of skeletons of lizardfolk with extremely wide feet, suited to sprinting across the hot desert sands as written about in the records.\n\nWhat has been cast in doubt is the validity of each one of the empires in this period. The biggest question mark lies over the 241st Empire. Based along a long river that snaked through the desert, their empire made the fertile plains of the river their home until they were wiped out by an alliance of genies and giants. This empire’s existence seemed foolproof, as there is clearly a large river running through the Salahad where the human empire of Kheterata lies. Even the city of Kheterat is said to have been built on the remains of a genie palatial complex.\n\nThe problems only begin when you start to analyse the history of the Mother’s Sorrow river. According to maps of Sarhal found in Aelantir drawn up by the Precursor Elves, there is zero evidence of the river existing. Was this story of the 241st Empire written not contemporaneously, but instead invented by a writer after the river already existed?"
 empire_333.106.a: "Impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete"
 empire_333.106.c: "Further records show it was referring to the Suran River in Bulwar"

 empire_333.107.t: "The 277th Empire"
 empire_333.107.d: "The 277th Empire knew of the prophecy of the 333rd Empire. Yet it seemed so distant, as most empires last at least a hundred years. They sought guidance from a powerful araizary, who advised them to repeatedly change themselves so each change would result in the birth of a new empire, in turn bringing them closer to the prophesied Final Empire. To achieve this, they collapsed and rebirthed themselves over and over again in a period of accelerationist madness. They got as far as the 295th Empire before the instability of repeated crashes meant they could not rebuild themselves again.\n\nA compelling tale, certainly, but one so riddled with logical holes that even a hatchling could tear it apart. What constitutes a “new” empire? Could an empire simply announce the end of their old empire and the next day the rebirth of a new to bring about the eventual final prophesied empire? Could not the 332nd Empire in Zerat have said they were a new empire after the Ashhana Bloodcurse snapped their empire in two, as was done with multiple other empires throughout history? Is the entire concept of a new empire simply the will of the naga and attempting to use logic to parse their reasoning is futile?"
 empire_333.107.a: "Surely the naga would not lie to us, right?"

 empire_333.108.t: "The 300th Empire"
 empire_333.108.d: "How do you prove one of the historical 333 empires truly existed? A surefire method should be contemporaneous writings. That must have been the stance of the naga when the 300th Empire was accepted into the true canon of the 333 empires, or its records attest events which provably happened? Yet an analysis of the text raises awkward questions about its validity as an empire.\n\nThe 300th Empire was a migratory tribe who took great care to chronicle their activities in every new location. These texts would be coated in a special plant sap to preserve their integrity, then buried deep underground in stone tombs, as the tribe placed great spiritual importance in the remembrance of their legacy after they moved on.\n\nThere is no world where this tribe could reasonably be considered an empire. And yet here they are, standing alongside empires that stretched from Fahvanosy to the Gulf of Rahen. Better yet, texts written in the exact same manner as this tribe were also responsible for chronicling the 301st, 302nd, 304th, and 305th empires. Either this practice of burying history was a popular practice, or this was the exact same tribe that simply moved location."
 empire_333.108.a: "Embarrassing"

 empire_333.109.t: "The 321st Empire"
 empire_333.109.d: "The farce of the 300th Empire being merely a migratory tribe is now a well known one in Taneyas, but the protestations against its inclusion into the 333 empires had largely blown over. A migratory tribe is capable of controlling a lot of land, and the concept of a migratory capital was not unheard of in society. There was also greater understanding of what lizardfolk society was like in this era. Sarhal was under the rule of genies and lizardfolk had to hide deep in the jungles to escape their attention. Our modern understanding of an empire would naturally be very different from those during the time of the 300th Empire, when lizardfolk populations were at their lowest ebb in millennia. In their time, a tribe with a large area of control could indeed be considered an empire.\n\nThis was all well and good, until the nature of the materials left by the 321st Empire were more widely publicised. Even most scholars of history only really knew of the powerful necromancer who raised an army of the dead. What they didn’t know was that the army she raised was one of these migratory tribes, who ignored the necromancer and went back to chronicling their migrations. The naga were able to explain the rationale behind the 300th Empire’s inclusion, but justifying a wandering tribe of skeletal lizards as an empire was going to take a monumental act of propaganda."

 empire_333.110.t: "The 324th Empire"
 empire_333.110.d: "The Greenblight was a terrible time to be a lizardfolk. Draconic beings flooded Taneyas and wrecked towns and villages across the jungles. Dragons have long been the natural enemy of lizardfolk, and tales from the Greenblight form a large part of the mythos of the evils propagated by dragons against our kind. This era saw the rise and fall of many different empires, many of them short-lived.\n\nAn empire in this era would usually be proclaimed when a hero slayed a dragon. This granted them authority to announce their emperorship and proclaim themselves to be the savior of lizardkind. Yet not all of these empires left records of what happened. Instead, it was up to their successors to write their history, and sometimes how these historians described their predecessors placed great doubt on whether they should even be considered an empire.\n\nTake the 324th Empire. Evidently the historian had little time for their great ruler. He wrote that the soon-to-be Emperor rode into town at the crack of dawn with the head of a dragon who had been terrorising them. Great celebrations abounded, until later that day it was discovered the dragon’s head was carefully constructed from tchoken bones with painted leaves arranged over them. The emperor was deposed, and the dragon attacked them and wiped out the town before even the sun had set."
 empire_333.110.a: "Can that still be called an empire?"

 empire_333.111.t: "The 9th Empire"
 empire_333.111.d: "What strengthens the case of a historical empire’s legitimacy is when there are multiple texts from later eras also detailing their exploits. The case is even stronger when they appear to match up with what was already known. If the two sources corroborate each other, then clearly this empire existed and was indeed another stepping stone on the way to the final, prophesied, 333rd Empire!\n\nOne particularly inquisitive naga scholar in Shangra had been digging through the oldest of records to find more information on the 9th Empire. They wanted to know why the only information about them was that they were devoured by cannibals, as that seemed to leave out a lot of important information. Future texts talked about how cannibalism was more common in the days of the earliest empires, but little more explanation was given. If he could track the paper trail across thousands of years, he could perhaps find where this came from.\n\nThis naga’s journey through the records is infamous in Khatalashya due to what they uncovered. The first source on the 9th Empire was from an claiming the 7th Empire devoured the 9th Empire. It was no historical text, but a play on words as when the phrase was spoken aloud in the ancient lizardfolk language, it sounded like one was counting from 6 to 9.\n\nWhat did the records have to say about the 7th Empire? That it was full of cannibals."

You don’t know what kind of fantastical beings existed 50,000 years ago. Could those empires of the past have believed in what the Precursor Elves accomplished for instance? Their reign wasn’t that long ago in the grand timeline of lizardfolk history, after all. Yet we have ample historical evidence of their existence.\n\nSome stories, though, clearly go too far for anyone to believe. Like that of the 29th Empire, whose emperor grew too powerful and too greedy after striking a deal with a demon. He devoured his foes, devoured the gods, devoured even the demon he made a pact with, before finally devouring the sun itself. This is obviously nonsensical. The sun is still there after all, and the idea someone on Halann could be capable of eating the sun is absurd on its very face."

 empire_333.114.t: "The 105th Empire"
 empire_333.114.d: "The trick to dating skeletons is to compare them with something they have been buried near, whose change in bone structure over time we know and understand. The typical comparison point has been that of tchoken bones. Unlike lizardfolk, the tchoken has changed in only relatively small ways over the thousands of years it has lived alongside lizardfolk, but change it still has. The only detail that has remained consistent is their tiny brains.\n\nUsing this method, archeologists and scholars have been able to confirm something that has long been theorised but never confirmed: naga are new. At least when it comes to the grand timeline of lizardfolk history, naga are a very recent mutation, only first appearing shortly after the Onslaught in 1200 BA. By itself this shouldn’t be a problem. With the collapse of the 330th Empire, the naga arrived to guide the lizardfolk to the prophesied Final Empire.\n\nThe problems arise when you realise naga appear in stories of historical empires much older than the 330th Empire. The 105th Empire collapsed after its ruler did not heed the warnings of his naga advisor and entered into a duel with the legendary being Tchazara. He lost, as all who tried to face Tchazara did, and his empire collapsed. Wouldn’t it be convenient if a naga invented that story so future rulers would be compelled to listen to what their naga advisors say?"
 empire_333.114.a: "How convenient"

 empire_333.115.t: "The 122nd Empire"
 empire_333.115.d: "Even those who know only a few of the 333 Empires know about the legendary figure of Tchazara. She was a seemingly immortal being, personally responsible for ending multiple empires between the 85th and the 121st empires. Some great warriors defeated her in battle and vanquished her from their lands, but she would inevitably return. As the legend goes, Tchazara only left after the empress of the 122nd Empire defeated her, not in battle, but by introducing her to the Thraxis. When faced with the eternal being, Tchazara realised even her immortality could not compete with eternity, and slunk off into the darkness, never to be seen again.\n\nThere are plenty of doubters of the prophecy who do not believe Tchazara was real. Her stories are fantastical to the extreme. Nobody has any good answer of what Tchazara even is. Her descriptive details do not tend to remain consistent across narratives. And yet there has never been an incident in which the naga, or indeed anyone, has had to quash stories of her doubters. If a lizardfolk does not believe in Tchazara, then they do not want to believe in the prophecy.\n\nBoth the prophecy and Tchazara come with two core beliefs. The first is that all past empires were destined to collapse. The second is that it will end with one empire immune to collapse that will rule for eternity. Tchazara is a symbol of that belief, arguably even more than the Thraxis is. Tchazara’s inevitability showed that none of these empires, no matter how great, could ever outlast the immortal being. However even immortality could not stand up to eternity.\n\nThose who believe in Khatalashya want to believe that they are eternity. That the tens of thousands of years of lizardfolk society’s cyclical collapse has ended. That Tchazara will not come for them, because she cannot beat eternity, and therefore cannot destroy Khatalashya."

 empire_333.116.t: "The 162nd Empire"
 empire_333.116.d: "The hardest question for the naga to answer regarding the historical 333 empires is not one of the many very silly stories of past empires. It is of an empire that did not count as one of the 333 empires, despite clearly being an empire. The Karrassian Empire was formed around 500 AA, and reached its height in the year 740. Its decline began with a crushing defeat to Kheterata, but at the height of its powers, its control stretched from Kunolo to western Ardimya.\n\nNone of the reasons given for why Karassk did not count hold up to any scrutiny. Technically the 332nd Empire still existed at that time with Zerat, but there were many previous empires active at once, most egregiously 214th to 219th Empires. Not controlling all of Taneyas does not matter either, as there have been empires that didn’t control one blade of grass in the traditional lizardfolk homeland, yet they are still held to count.\n\nThe most common reason given is a lack of approval of other lizardfolk as an empire due to their heinous acts, most notably when they blew up the ancient Zatsarya in Ashazual. Without recognition from other lizardfolk, they can’t be called an empire. This argument falls apart, however, when you recall the tale of the 162nd Empire, which was ruled over by a terrible dragon that everyone hated and refused to call emperor.\n\nThose who critique the prophecy say there is a very simple reason why they were not recognised as the 333rd Empire: it is because the naga had almost no power within Karassk at the time, and the naga did not want to grant the title of the prophesied final and eternal empire to a nation they did not control."

 empire_333.117.d: "To count every empire in history is a long and arduous task. It required hundreds of scholars across hundreds of years to painstakingly reach a consensus that we were on the 332nd Empire, and that the Final Empire would be the next one. When you scour through historical documents, sometimes what you thought was a brand new empire was in fact just the same as an empire previously counted, but told from a different perspective. For example, the records detailing what was believed to be the 226th Empire speak of a great spire on Fahvanosy, very likely a Zatsarya. We now know this spire was buried in a volcanic eruption during the time of the 223rd Empire, so the document is very likely just another descriptor of the 226th.\n\nThis is a normal part of historical research, and should have been uncontroversial. Except we cannot revise any of the historical empires anymore. If we did that, we would not be the 333rd. Our entire foundation would be a lie. So even if every piece of evidence points to our miscounting, we can never, ever accept it."

 empire_333.118.d: "The 332nd Empire is one of the longest lasting empires in history. It took Zerat over 1,500 years after its formation before it finally fell for good. At least, that’s what the official records go by. As everyone knows though, Zerat stopped being a true empire after the Shadowfang Invasion, when the bloodcursed crocodilian lizardfolk rampaged through Taneyas and split their great empire in half. The polity around Shalazar split into its own kingdom, completely separate from the primary capital in Zerat.\n\nSo why did that not count as the end of the 332nd Empire? Why was Shalazar not considered the true continuation of the old Zerat empire? Shalazar was even the old capital of the empire. It only moved to Zerat in the wake of the invasion. Empires have been counted as “collapsed” over far less significant means. Often the records don’t even elaborate on what “collapse” meant. The 197th Empire collapsed after the emperor was killed by a falling tchoken. Nothing more need be explained."

 empire_333.119.d: "The 250th Empire is possibly the most mysterious empire of them all. Its text speaks of lands not known to exist anywhere on this earth. It speaks of darkness, death, hooded robed figures in red, white castles floating in the distance, occasional fields of red flowers, and streams of souls. Scholars have debated the true location of this empire for centuries, but the most common and widely agreed upon explanation is that this empire exists in the shadow plane. Corroborating this theory is the legend of the 239th Empire, which was banished to the Shadow Plane after its emperor attempted to make a deal with a Silat, a genie from the Shadow Plane. The messages found from the 250th Empire were likely a cry for help from the lizardfolk locked in the plane of shadow.\n\nThis is all well and good, but it raises the awkward question: should they count if they are not even in this plane of existence? According to cosmological theory of planes, there are countless numbers of planes, all of which could potentially contain other lost lizardfolk civilisations. If we don’t know of them, then our count could be wildly off. What of lands outside of Halann itself? We could be the 3,333rd Empire for all we know."

 empire_333.120.t: "The 303rd Empire"
 empire_333.120.d: "The Djinn Wars of Hegemony were a series of titanic genie conflicts that occured thousands of years ago across Sarhal. A great djinn known only as the Grand Sultan allied with mercenary giants and marched his armies across the continent, ultimately subjugating all to his will. Upon his victory, he travelled to the center of the continent and conducted a final ritual that would solidify his power once and for all. This ritual was a success, but in the process he “un-made” his own existence, and the great empire he built collapsed.\n\nThe 303rd Empire was ruled by a great and powerful lizardfolk mage. He subjugated all the other lizardfolk nations, helped in part by an alliance with giants. At the great war’s conclusion, he went to the spire in Zerat and conducted a great ritual to crown himself emperor over all empires for eternity. The ritual backfired and his existence was un-made.\n\nSome of you may have noticed the similarities between the two stories. The Djinn Wars of Hegemony exist across multiple cultures. It is a story told by Precursor Elves and humans. It exists in the records of giants and of genies. The story of the 303rd Empire only exists in lizardfolk records. One might think that perhaps a past lizardfolk scholar perhaps mistook a text on the Djinn Wars of Hegemony as a record of lizardfolk empires. If one was a doubter of the prophecy, that is."

We’ve learned an immense amount about their culture and their history. What particularly interested us is what they thought of the great spire out by the seafront. In their legends, it was a ship their people travelled on to reach these lands. An entire city from a land beyond the stars travelled to this land to create a new home for themselves.\n\nAccording to the legends, the entire trip was an accident, so re-entering the spire is considered unlucky as it could teleport you away from home, never to be seen again. One of the Romuthians there, an elderly lizard, showed us an ancient relic from eons past that supposedly spoke of the journey.\n\nOur own people recognised the writing though. It was an ancient form of lizardfolk writing, one that died out around the time of the 136th Empire. This was an empire that collapsed after its entire capital city disappeared one day, after one of the ancient spires lit up with the light of the stars. The text did not talk about some grand mystery; it was a legal document from a farmer demanding he be paid compensation from the state for teleporting him without his tchoken ranch."

If whatever was summoned upon the activation of the spire was dangerous, a pile of sticks would not be sufficient protection. Instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] insisted on being the one to turn the ancient stone crank that the engineers believed, with about 40% certainty, would kickstart the machinery inside.

If we are the Final Empire, are we about to end eternity?”\n\nThe $MONARCHTITLE$ lifted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands off the handle and stood back, but now the crank was moving on its own. Every part of the spire was moving. The walls shifted and the walls glittered with the lights of a million stars. Then, with one final blinding light, it was gone.\n\nZerat was gone.\n\nTaneyas was gone.\n\nHalann was gone."
 empire_333.200.a: "…what have we done?"

 empire_333.225.t: "Romutha"
 empire_333.225.d: "The front gate entering the Zatsarya no longer gazed over the city of Zerat, but over a calm sea. The sky was a deep navy blue with a few twinkling lights, but for one section of the sky. There hovered an inky black dot with a ring of blinding light around its perimeter. It looked like the opposite of the sun, a darkness so deep it seemed to reject the very concept of light.\n\nThe first to step foot outside the spire was a guard who had entered with the $MONARCHTITLE$. Gingerly poking at the dark soil before stepping out, he prodded the ground with the butt of his sword before stepping anywhere. Another guard followed, then one of the craftspeople, and finally $MONARCHTITLE$ [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nBeneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet shifted a fine, dark sand, like the beaches in Fahvanosy. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stepped into the sea, letting the water wash calmly around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stood there, motionless, as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes adjusted to the dark sky. What should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] call it? Romutha - dark sun in lizardfolk - perhaps? It was…peaceful.\n\n”My $MONARCHTITLE$, come here quick! We’re going to try to reactivate the Zatsarya.” The head engineer stood just outside the water and gestured furiously at [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] contemplated rejecting the call. There were no naga in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ear here, driving [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to constantly improve. Here, on Romutha, there was just the sound of the waves.\n\nBut [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stepped out of the water, through the doors of the spire, and turned the handle as before. The same lights, the same gears, the same stars all sparkled, until through the doors one gazed out again over the two lakes that flanked Zerat. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped out of the spire, tracking dark sand into the courtyard as attendants and naga rushed to his side, and squinted at the blinding light of a familiar sun."
 empire_333.225.a: "I want to go back"

 empire_333.201.t: "Return to Romutha"
 empire_333.201.d: "With every subsequent journey to Romutha, more lizardfolk and far more supplies and equipment packed into the bottom floor of the spire in Zerat. Food, tents, ropes, glass containers for taking samples home, and even weapons joined the colonists. Many had wondered whether the lands to which the Zatsarya had sent them were part of the shadow plane, the land of death, where the night hags derived their power. It quickly became clear that could not be the case, for this land, Romutha, was alive.\n\nLeave the beach and the large, jagged rocky outcrop the spire backed into, and one entered a vast field of soft, green, leafy plants, growing out of a black soil. Small insect-like creatures hopped between the leaves, skittering underground as the scouts drew near. Most extraordinarily of all were the giant caterpillar-like creatures, measuring up to 16 meters in length, leaving long tracks of chewed plants in their wake.\n\nThis was far from the end of their discoveries. Large rocky spouts spewed a multicolored gas into the air, their bases teaming with a brilliant collection of plant and animal life. Far overhead one could make out huge winged beasts, too far into the sky to make out their exact shape. But the most extraordinary discovery of all was on the final day.\n\nAt the bottom of a valley, beyond lines of plants arranged far more neatly than nature would allow, lay a small town. The inhabitants did look quite different from us. They had large tails for starters, and the joints on their knees bent the other way, leading into feet with a large hook on their heel. But we had seen enough strange mutations to look beyond such minor differences. The scales, the facial structure, the eyes: there was no mistaking it."
 empire_333.201.a: "We found lizardfolk"

 empire_333.202.t: "Harsh Life on Romutha"
 empire_333.202.d: "The medium-term goal had been to build a habitable colony in Romutha, but that was proving difficult. Building material had to be transported from Zerat, as there was nothing akin to large trees from which to build houses, and the stone here was unusually brittle. There was no day-night cycle, either. The black sun and its ring of light shone down from the sky at all times. Growing crops was also proving tough. Taneyas was full of hardy plants that could sprout in mere days in even the most minimal of soil cover, but over 90% of plants failed to sprout when planted in Romutha’s dark soil.\n\nThe worst day, though, was nearly a year into the life of the colony. One of the flying creatures spotted in the sky during the scouting expeditions descended on one of our settlements. It resembled a butterfly but thousands of times larger, making not a sound bar the beating of its massive wings. That was, until it started emitting a dark light from its body, accompanied with a high pitch whistling, before unleashing a beam of light so destructive it carved a molten path through the ground itself. It only shot once, but it was enough to destroy two homes and the granary, before it beat its wings and rose back into the dark blue sky again."
 empire_333.202.a: "Maybe it was a mistake to try live here"

 empire_333.231.t: "Natives of Romutha"
 empire_333.231.d: "It took many failed attempts, but the first food grown entirely on Romutha had finally been harvested. But it was no Taneyas plant that fed the bellies of the colonists. We had sent our scouts on a stealth mission, hoping to learn what food the natives ate, but they were found by the natives straight away and taken into the village.\n\nThe meeting was entirely friendly. The natives seemed even more shocked than we were that someone resembling lizardfolk had visited them. Although they did not speak any language recognised by the scouts, through drawings and wild gestures our scouts were able to communicate that we had arrived via the large spire, and that they wanted to know what to eat. The natives showed them the plants they grew, where they could be found, and how to tend to them so they would grow.\n\nMore and more visitors travelled to the village, often bringing gifts for the natives, who in return travelled to our new colony and marvelled at the incredible structures we had built. In particular they were bamboozled by anything made of wood, as their homes were either hewn into the rocky outcrops or nestled within the large discarded shells left by the molting giant caterpillars that ever munched their way across the landscape.\n\nIt had taken years, longer than even the first colonies on Aelantir, but by now, with the farms and new homes, we could feel safe in saying the colony Romutha was now self-sufficient."
 empire_333.231.a: "Now where the hell are we?"

 empire_333.203.t: "A Second Activation"
 empire_333.203.d: "Although we had activated one spire, that didn’t mean those who were entering Kazakesh were any less nervous. There were practical questions: whether the spire on the other side would be deep underground as Kazakesh was, whether we should we transport all people, equipment, and resources to the very bottom of the spire and assume it will be at ground level, or instead stay towards the top of the spire and assume that is where we would step out? Would we return to a different spot on Romutha, or somewhere else entirely? \n\nA clattering of gears, stars lighting up the entire deep trench the spire was buried until, a blinding light, and then…red.\n\nThis was certainly not Romutha. The spire stood in a vast, dusty, open plain, with nary a single living thing in sight. The main doors opened onto mere dirt, while those at the top peered through the semi-transparent walls, trying to make out anything across the barren landscape. In a brief parting of the copious dust clouds, one could just about make out what seemed to be a village.\n\nA small scouting crew set out on the roughly hour walk to the village, only to find it was just ruins. A larger crew returned with shovels to dig up the remains, but they were so old it was difficult to draw any conclusions. That is, until one uncovered a skeleton. Its bones were different to anything you would find on Halann, save two specific creatures. The first was a tchoken, and this creature stood on two legs so was evidently not a tchoken. The other animal with bones like this? Lizardfolk."
 empire_333.203.a: "The lizardfolk were here too"

 empire_333.204.t: "Meeting the Natives"
 empire_333.204.d: "On a rare clear day, when the dust clouds subsided, one could just make out from the top of the Zatsarya something other than dusty red dirt in every direction. A faint shimmering that indicated water, and possibly even some green colors. A big expedition was planned, including gifts to give to these native lizardfolk once we met them, along with a picture book to help them learn our language. This would not be like Romutha, where our introduction to the natives was being found spying. This would be a glorious envoy of friendship.\n\nThey were not lizardfolk. There was not a scale in sight amongst the population here. At first we thought we had found humans, although the pointed ears gave the final hint needed: Elves! Much larger than the almost delicate elves one would find in Cannor or Bulwar, measuring as tall as an Ashhana Lizardfolk, with muscles to match even the strongest troll. \n\nThe meeting did not go well.They took offence to our presence and even hurled spears at us, albeit with so much force that they might as well have been firing guns. At least four died in the attack - three elves and one lizardfolk. There were serious debates about whether an invasion force should be sent in revenge, but one of the attendees recognised some of the words shouted from her time studying the records in Kazakesh. They were speaking a variant of the ancient Precursor Elven language.\n\nA second, less violent expedition was sent to the village. There were no deaths this time, but it was not a successful diplomatic voyage. The village elder who met our entourage simply hurled insults at us and refused our gifts. They seemed convinced we were about to send a mythical monster known as a Wishcatcher their way, and knew nothing of any living lizardfolk in these lands."
 empire_333.204.a: "That was not a successful outing"
 
 empire_333.205.t: "Welcome to Agradent"
 empire_333.205.d: "Much like on Romutha, starting a colony here was difficult. The ground was not suitable for crops. It did rain occasionally, but the rain merely bounced off the surface and did not seep into the red soil. One tchoken farmer had tried to set up a ranch here, and his animals were remarkably unfussed by the harsh landscape and were able to sniff out small bugs under the soil, but there wasn’t nearly enough food for them to keep the ranch going. There were dreams of finding local lizardfolk to assist us, but the only natives we could find were other elven villages, and they were even less appreciative of our visit than the first.\n\nMany who arrived instead took to travelling across the barren landscape to see if they could find somewhere more suitable to start a colony, and these journeys did locate promising spots. Areas where an oasis rose up from the soil, with an array of plants living around it. Small streams and rivers with fish swimming in them. This land had life; it was just hard to find.\n\nWhat was also proving difficult was navigating the landscape, what with the constant dust storms. At least one party had gone missing entirely. It wasn’t until it was realised the stars were roughly the same as they were back in Taneyas that progress was made. There were some differences. Notably the planet of Agradent was missing entirely, and an entirely new faint blue star could be spotted in the sky.\n\nIt took embarrassingly long for us to figure out why that was. That faint blue dot was Halann. We were on Agradent."
 empire_333.205.a: "We’re on another planet!"
 empire_333.205.tt: "I can see my home from here!"

 empire_333.206.t: "A Snowy World"
 empire_333.206.d: "This was not a welcoming land. Lizardfolk are typically ill-suited for icy weather, and as soon as the blinding light of the Zatsarya subsided, snow was billowing in through the open door. However, upon leaving the spire the air felt warm despite the snow. The heat appeared to be coming from the earth itself. Dotted around the vicinity were hot springs of warm and sometimes bubbling hot water. Vents in the earth shot piping hot steam into the air. A thick moss grew everywhere, with a variety of strange flowers blowing bubbles into the air to mix with the falling snow.\n\nIt didn’t take long to find the native population either. In fact, they found us first. They were lizardfolk, albeit with incredibly thick hides and wide feet that resembled hooves. Alongside them strolled a small cat-like creature with an outer shell resembling a crab, which glowed with a heat so strong it burnt the moss it stood on.\n\nFirst contact with the native lizardfolk went much better than some of our previous meetings with natives. They seemed awed by our presence and were eager to try communicating with us. The only time one of them seemed to take offence was when one lizardfolk tried to touch the shelled cat, although that may have just been to warn against touching something so hot.\n\nIn their nearby village, which was located in a string of winding underground tunnels, we were presented with a gift: a rather foul-smelling blanket made of furs and blubber, indicating that more animals definitely did exist on this planet. The diplomatic envoy we sent concluded that the natives maybe lacked a sense of smell, although after carrying it back to Halann, the smell stayed on his body for over a month."
 empire_333.206.a: "How very nice of them"

 empire_333.207.t: "Zulkanez"
 empire_333.207.d: "The official name we’d given to the planet was Zulkanez, named after the many volcanoes that appeared to dot the landscape. Perhaps there were distant lands of rain and jungles like our beloved Taneyas, but as far as our early expeditions could tell, it was a frozen hellhole broken up by under-earth heating that melted the ice and made the land habitable.\n\nThe good news is that our expeditions to these other areas of heated land were not only successful, but found entirely new lizardfolk villages here. Each one spoke what appeared to be a variant of the language from the island we landed on, which implied there was once a connection between these islands. Whatever happened to them, we don’t know. Perhaps this freezing was recent? We already know it only takes one generation for new lizardfolk mutations adapted to their new surroundings to appear after all, and the thick hides of the natives certainly helped them brave the cold."
 empire_333.207.a: "What mysteries this planet holds"

 empire_333.208.t: "Shanyza on Zulkanez"
 empire_333.208.d: "Zulkanez was not for the faint of heart. It wasn’t just the bitter cold of the surface. As soon as you tried to enter the tunnels, you were hit with a sweltering wall of humidity that made even the worst days in Taneyas feel like a cool breeze. Despite our early positive meetings with the natives, they did not like us entering their villages. Besides, few lizardfolk wanted to live in those tunnels. Instead we lived on the opposite side of the island and tried to make do.\n\nThe colony was hit with problem after problem. The furs and wood we brought ran into the issue of catching fire if one of the native shelled cats rubbed up against them. Preventing those cats from doing so was basically impossible, as they wandered to and fro as they pleased, often sleeping soundly in the middle of the camp. At the very least, they acted as a substitute for campfires given the heat they produced, albeit a campfire that would stand up and wander away without warning. There were attempts to find other islands more suitable for habitation, but striking out into the snowy wasteland was a recipe for an inevitable death.\n\nThe biggest problem though was no lizardfolk actually wanted to live there - with one exception. The Ashhana Lizardfolk seemed much more at home here, especially a specific type of Ashhana known as Shanyza. Their hulking bodies and thick hide were famous for being able to deflect even musketfire, which happened to double as a great protection against both the snow and steam. Before long, the colony consisted of only two types of people: outcasts and vagabonds, and Shanyza Lizardfolk."
 empire_333.208.a: "Glad someone can stand the weather"

 empire_333.209.t: "Water World"
 empire_333.209.d: "As the lights from the Zatsarya faded, what swept into the open doors of the Zatsarya was a sweet sea breeze, almost like being in Karassk. The Zatsarya was atop a small hill with a worn path leading out from its door. At first we thought it would lead to a village and another type of native lizardfolk, but this just led down the hill to a beach with nary a soul in sight, bar a few odd crab-like creatures that made bubbling noises as they skittered along the sand.\n\nIt didn’t take long to explore the surroundings. Climb a few stories in the Zatsarya and you could make out every corner of the island the spire was located on. It was very pleasant, certainly, similar to the islands the Karshyray Lizardfolk lived on, but there were no signs of any other islands in the vicinity.\n\nCompared to some of the other planets we’d teleported to, this journey was very uneventful. Pleasant, yes, but every corner of the island had been searched within a few days. We would have to return with a boat, perhaps multiple, if we wanted to explore this land more."
 empire_333.209.a: "Can we fit a boat inside the spire?"

 empire_333.210.t: "Leviathans"
 empire_333.210.d: "It took some disassembling and reassembling, but the first boats on Shagatan were ready to set sail. Transports set out in every direction, told to return within a month if they could find no new land. This continued throughout the year; by the end only one crew had found anything above sea level, and that was an island even smaller than the one we stood on. But what they had witnessed beneath the waves had made discussions of land less relevant.\n\nThe ocean floor was teeming with life. The water here acted differently to what we were used to on Halann. You didn’t experience the same pressures going deep underwater, and light was able to travel much deeper than it could normally. That barely mattered though, for the seafloor was awash with lights from plants and fish and even structures clearly built by sentient life, although nobody had spotted any signs of settlements like the merfolk settlements back home. At night the sea shone as brightly as the stars above it.\n\nBut it was what the last ship had spotted that made the rest wary to head out again. As deep as you could see in the water, even that had its limits, and eventually you entered the open ocean, the endless depths. It was there that the crew spotted something enormous. It was bigger than a Zatsarya - bigger than the island they arrived on. It was swimming deep underwater, entire ecosystems of lights dotting its back. It turned and the tip of a fin, larger than a mountain, breached the waves; our scout ship almost capsized in the resulting tumult. After that, it dove down out of sight."
 empire_333.210.a: "We’re going to need a bigger boat"

 empire_333.211.t: "Under the Sea"
 empire_333.211.d: "It was a normal day on Shagatan. A new group of colonists were set to arrive via the Zatsarya, likely the last given there was little room left on the island without destroying its ecosystem. A small crowd gathered on the beach at the end of the path from the spire. A few lizards emerged from the water too - even with some native wildlife being dangerous, lizardfolk were semi-aquatic, and had taken to the waters around the island with ease. These lizards, though, looked different. Webbed hands and feet, an awkward gait when moving on land, and fins across their arms, back, and on the top of their head. These had not arrived from Halann. These were natives!\n\nOver the next few weeks, more aquatic lizardfolk emerged from the sea to talk with us. We were able to gather that they lived deep underwater in giant “bubble” cities, and they had a ritual to visit the spire on the island every four years to pay respect to, as far as we could tell through the language barrier, their ancestors; lizardfolk like us. They seemed shocked when we explained we could not dive so deep underwater as they could. We did send some of our best swimmers with them, but a lizardfolk can only hold their breath for 10-15 minutes. So they promised to return with…well, again with language barriers it was tough to tell, but… a “bubble”?"
 empire_333.211.a: "I must see these bubble cities"

 empire_333.212.t: "The Precursor Moon"
 empire_333.212.d: "A bitterly cold wind met our explorers as they stepped out of the Zatsarya and into some sort of vast cavern. Large holes opened above to the night sky.. An incredibly vast sphere of swirling reds and browns dominated the sky, the stars merely peripheral. Wrapping up in their thick all-weather blankets, the first intrepid planetary explorers stepped out onto the dusty floor and began their investigation.\n\nThe first report delivered back to Taneyas was that this was not a planet, but instead a moon. Habitable moons had been theorised before, and researchers had even brought up the possibility that our own moon on Halann might be habitable. But despite its relative closeness, no Zatsarya had been found that was connected to it, and leaving Halann via propulsion seemed absurd on its face. How would that even work? Would one simply keep flying upwards until one reached space? Preposterous!\n\nThe other major element of the report was the expeditionaries’ conviction that this place was clearly not just visited by Precursor Elves, but substantially altered by their presence. Precursor structures littered the landscape, both on the surface and in the many vast caverns underneath. The Zatsarya was the only sign that there were even lizardfolk here before. As for what the Precursors were doing here, we only have theories. Attempting to mimic the dwarves and their tunnels is the best guess we have now. Further investigations will be necessary."
 empire_333.212.a: "How fascinating"

 empire_333.213.t: "Téinglios, the Precursor Mining Complex"
 empire_333.213.d: "Further exploration of the Precursor moon has uncovered all sorts of incredible discoveries. Firstly, we know what they called it: Téinglios. Secondly, we now know why they were here. This moon hosts a truly incredible amount of damestear, although most of it is located deep underground. Many of the buildings and contraptions here appear to have been in service of a complex mining operation, although how we turn any of them back on is a mystery.\n\nThe other major discovery is just how hostile this planet is to life. The bitter chill of the winds howling between the caverns is the least of our problems. The air is filled with dust which can be toxic to breath; based on our analysis of recovered remains, damestear lung was a common illness amongst the first inhabitants. Earthquakes are a constant threat, forcing our builders to rethink how they build their homes. The structures left by the Precursors shake when the earth moves, which is why our early intrepid colonists stayed clear of them; but it’s been two years and not a single one has collapsed, which has led many colonists to decide that perhaps the shaking is intentional.\n\nLiving here is incredibly difficult, but there is one spark of hope. Some of the Precursor records imply that they had ways of controlling the climate that lessened the chill and cleared the air of dust. If we could figure out how to reactivate those, perhaps we too could plunder the riches of this moon."
 empire_333.213.a: "So much damestear just out of reach"
 empire_333.213.tt: "Damn this place sure isnt habbitable ;-;"

 empire_333.214.t: "The Dust Subsides"
 empire_333.214.d: "We were never able to replicate exactly what the Precursors used to power the terraforming machines on Téinglios, but we were able to come up with our own method: Coal. A combination of coal and damestear, when shoveled heartily into the bowels of the engines, rattled the machinery into life. Despite their age, all Precursor architecture had an incredible elegance to it. Even here, on this unfriendly hostile moon, the golden lights of their magnificent structures cast a warm glow across the caverns.\n\nWithin a week, the differences were clear. The dust had dropped significantly. The everpresent sparkles that had become synonymous with toxic air no longer existed in the main cavern where the Zatsarya was located. There was a warmth emanating from long strips of lights that connected the different corners of the vast cavern. It still wasn’t the most welcoming land we had ever seen, but it was a lot more livable than it had been previously."
 empire_333.214.tt: "Repairing Precursor technology allowed us to make this place habbitable"
 empire_333.214.a: "When do we start getting damestear?"

 empire_333.215.t: "Dropped into the Middle of a War"
 empire_333.215.d: "Given that the Zatsaryas in Zerat and Shalazar had cities built around them, it shouldn’t be surprising societies on other planets had built their own cities around the great spires. Still, it was a shock for our latest expedition to encounter a gaggle of lizardfolk attendants upon leaving the spire. They were different from the ones who lived on Halann: shorter, with stumpy legs and broad, flatter faces, but unmistakably lizardfolk like us. In the distance we could see out over a bay with a large, walled city, surrounded by dense jungle with roads leading out in all directions.\n\nThe first contact conversations were not hostile, but there was tension in the air. As far as we could gather, one of the people in the first group of lizardfolk who saw us leave the Zatsarya was the daughter of the ruling monarch, and had taken it upon herself to act as the primary mediator between us and the natives. She picked up on our language quickly, and was able to roughly explain why the mood was so tense.\n\nTheir nation was in the midst of a war, and our arrival was considered an omen. The only issue was nobody knew what exactly this omen meant. The opposing forces were led by a powerful wizard who commanded armies of brainwashed lizardfolk. Fighting was fierce, but her side was losing, and hope was evaporating in the city. Assigning forces to guard the spire now that random aliens were appearing from it was not a welcome evolution of the conflict.\n\nAt least, that was the stance of those who feared our arrival. They wanted us to leave peacefully. The princess had a different message though: If you could do anything, anything at all, to save our people in this hour of need, we would be eternally grateful. Your legend would be sung for centuries. It would be the dawn of a new era of peace and freedom on our planet of Zangea."
 empire_333.215.a: "Well, how could we say no to that?"

 empire_333.216.t: "The Greatest War Halann Has Never Seen"
 empire_333.216.d: "“This is but a single text. A letter back to Halann to keep you abreast of what happened here on Zangea. I have been informed by my superiors to limit its length, for to become too verbose would lead to its contents being glossed over. I am writing to tell you that our forces on Zangea have been victorious, but to describe it in such brief terms does not do justice to the twists and turns of this war.\n\nConsider the siege of Arranga, where the great warrior Sitarr met the Beast of the Nether on the battlements as their duel was watched by tens of thousands of soldiers on either side. Then the Sky Battle of Ashtari, where the night sky lit up with a thousand red lights as the flying creatures of the wizard Zuzuvar clashed with the noble winged steeds of Yelarde. The final duel upon the Nameless Mountain, where the mark of Orsef was engraved into its side in the final duel with the wizard.\n\nNone of these likely make a lick of sense to you, for you have not been on Zangea. You do not understand the bond we have formed with these people. They are our brothers and sisters, for we have died for them, as they have died for us. You do not understand their history, nor understand the true scale of what our arrival meant to their people. We likely saved them from a thousand years of darkness. Our soldiers are heroes whose names will be sung forever more.\n\nI hope Halann will allow me to tell this story in more detail. I hope I will be granted the freedom to write every facet of our victory, and how close we came so many times to defeat. For this is the greatest war Halann has never seen.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nKrakzar Riverclaw”"
 empire_333.216.a: "We won!"

 empire_333.217.t: "A Home on Zangea"
 empire_333.217.d: "Though we emerged victorious on Zangea, our late arrival on the scene meant much of the continent has been severely damaged and depopulated. Cities and towns are still in the process of rebuilding, with many having been abandoned altogether. Too many of the original inhabitants have died, and what is left of the villages is not worth saving. Some lands remain cursed by magic and make ill-suited homes for the natives.\n\nMany of our own soldiers who fought on Zangea have found life on Halann difficult, for as much as the story of their victory has become national legend, they feel isolated. It’s only with those who too lived through the war that they feel secure. Many returned to Zangea. The relationships they have built with the natives meant they feel more at home there than in Taneyas.\n\nThis made things quite awkward on Zangea, for their cities were ill-suited to absorb the many soldiers arriving through the Zatsarya, looking to move permanently to the planet. After rounds of diplomatic talks, it has finally been agreed that some of the depopulated lands will be handed permanently over to the Halanni Lizardfolk. There is little there left to move into, but thousands of natives wanted to support our people who had saved them during the great war. The lands will be made suitable for habitation once again. Our veterans will have their new home."
 empire_333.217.a: "That’s nice of them"

 empire_333.218.t: "Atamumba"
 empire_333.218.d: "The Echenka humans have called this thicket, where the spire was uncovered, Atamumba. They fear it and have legends about it whisking away those who dare enter the area. The name has stuck amongst the lizardfolk here, despite attempts by the naga to rename it to something easier to pronounce for their own population. As the spire flashed and its lights lit up the swamp, those inside the spire spooked each other with ghostly stories of what scary creatures we may find on the other side. What would we find on Atamumba?\n\nStepping out of the spire, we appeared to be in the middle of a large field of a generally arid landscape. There were clear signs of agriculture at work, and even a few lizardfolk spotted working amongst the rows of scraggly-looking trees. Our people! By now we had a full procedure for first contact. Look large but unthreatening. Hand out gifts to the natives, while showing open palms to show you are not armed. Use a large and brightly colored language book to speak with them.\n\nThese natives, though, were different. They had strange shards of pink scales growing at awkward angles out of their scales, and glowing yellowy-green eyes that gave no clue as to what they were thinking. Their gazes moved as one as our welcoming party tried to communicate, but not one responded, nor even looked at the gifts we presented. After various failed attempts to get any reaction, our diplomatic envoys gave up and walked back to the crew outside the spire, who had been examining the local plants and rocks around the spire.\n\nThen there was a clicking noise. A rhythmic tapping, like that of a woodpecker, but from each of the yellow-eyed lizardfolk. As one, each of them began to step forward, raising their right arms. One loud click, and out from their arms blasted forth a barrage of sharp-tipped spikes. Every lizard of the welcoming party dropped, glowing yellow spikes piercing their bodies. A second volley, and a second wave of lizardfolk collapsed, clutching at the shards embedded in their chests. By the time the third volley was loosed, one member had finally started spinning up the crank and with it, the few surviving members saw the sparkling lights and re-emerged into the strangely re-assuring darkness of the Shadow Swamp."

 empire_333.221.t: "Ancient Lizardfolk Ruins"
 empire_333.221.d: "The arrival expedition stepped out of the Zatsarya and into thick, humid air beneath a hazy sun. Normally every Zatsarya on a new planet was the same size as the one we stepped into, but the Zatsarya here was gigantic, twice the size of the one back on Halann. The ground was soft underfoot, like it was soaked with moisture, roots poking out along the earth like veins.\n\nThese lands were littered with ruins, most of them hewn from a black, smooth stone with intricate patterns drawn on the side. It was difficult to tell how old they were, especially since some of these artistic designs looked unblemished. Some of the art was of lizardfolk, indicating we had once again come across the remains of a dead lizardfolk society. \n\nThe mood amongst the expedition crew was surprisingly relaxed. Several new words and phrases had entered lizardfolk parlance since they first set foot on another planet. One especially evocative one was rakh-tar. It was usually translated into Common as ‘homesickness’, but that didn’t quite capture the meaning. Rakh-tar was the deep, unsettling sensation that the land you stand on is somewhere you don’t belong, the endless screaming in your mind that tells you this isn’t your Rakh - your home. It was something almost everyone who visited another planet felt at one point.\n\nNobody experienced rakh-tar here. Instead, they were delaying the return trip, pointing out spots that would make a good spot for a house, where the tchoken ranches could be located, the open clearing where a naga hall could be built. Wondering if in the future they would be calling this place their home."
 empire_333.221.a: "We’ll go back to Halann later"

 empire_333.222.t: "The Command Room"
 empire_333.222.d: "Every one of the ancient cities in Taneyas is built atop the ruins of the same ancient city from the empire before. Zerat is built atop Zerat. Shalazar is built atop Shalazar. If you forage through the dense inland jungles away from the main paths, it’s not uncommon to uncover incredible structures from empires long dead. The jungle floor is littered with the remains of civilization, reclaimed by nature.\n\nThis planet felt like Taneyas. Dig up an ancient slab and one uncovered the interior of a building, reclaimed by nature. Dig under that and one found another, and another, and another. One expedition team uncovered what appeared to be a large bathing complex, and even found tools that assist with scale shedding. Another found a giant mural sporting incredibly lifelike lizardfolk paintings. It was difficult to tell if it depicted a battle scene with a warband descending on a great hero, or perhaps a concert where a singer performed to an adoring crowd.\n\nThe most extraordinary building was a room that resembled the inside of a Zatsarya, complete with starry symbols across every translucent wall – except the number of wheels and cranks and buttons numbered into the several hundreds. The scale was extraordinary and it would likely take years, decades, even centuries to figure out what this room was. It took us thousands of years to work out what our own Zatsarya did, after all."
 empire_333.222.a: "Well our empire has forever to figure it out!"

 empire_333.223.t: "A Familiar Visitor"
 empire_333.223.d: "The animals here were strange. It was clear they didn’t have much in the way of natural predators, and so reacted slowly to our advances, if they reacted at all. Large, fat, dragonfly-like creatures would sit atop the tree leaves and guzzle down the moisture. A grasshopper-like creature about a meter tall would not react until you made a loud noise near it, upon which it would catapult itself far into the air. For as high and as far as it could launch itself, it hadn’t appeared to have mastered the act of landing, and would simply spread-eagle and roll over several times upon landing.\n\nBut the creature that had been the real talk of the early colony was a small creature, about the size of a dog, that had wandered into the camp the other day. It looked familiar. Yes its legs were a bit longer and its eyes protruded out more than we were used to. But the bug eyes, the gormless expression, and its inability to tell that it may have been in danger when one of the colonists picked it up? There was no mistake what this was.\n\nA tchoken!\n\nThis has raised all sorts of new questions. Why was there a tchoken here? We already know lizardfolk are not from Halann, so does this confirm that tchoken too are not from Halann? Is this their homeworld? Or were they brought here by lizardfolk like those on Halann? Did this one taste just as good as our own when fried over an open fire with a few Vyzemby herbs for seasoning?"
 empire_333.223.a: "The tchoken homeworld"

 empire_333.224.t: "Night Sky in Every Direction"
 empire_333.224.d: "The Zatsarya of Ashazual was by far the most difficult to repair. When the Karassian Empire blew up the spire, the scattered pieces rained down on the city in the form of giant black needles, each the size of a house. They had remained there for centuries until the great builders and engineers of Khatalashya started the reconstruction effort. Now it was ready, towering at full height in all its original glory. The stars on its facade sparkled once again, the machinery inside humming just like the spire in Zerat. It was glorious, and soon it would deliver us to another world. Supplies were prepared - weapons, food, shovels, tents - and the son of the $MONARCHTITLE$ was present to ceremonially turn the the crank which would send us to whatever planet awaited on the other side.\n\nRight as the light subsided, something was clearly wrong. The force normally holding one to the floor disappeared and each lizard started to float. Air disappeared from the lungs of everyone in attendance. Those standing near the door shot outside, carried by a sharp gust. There was nothing but the night sky in every direction. \n\nThe head engineer tried to get the $MONARCHTITLE$’s son to turn the crank and bring the group back, but he had floated away, claws gripping his throat in a silent scream. The engineer grabbed the handle and, bracing herself against the wall, yanked it down hard. She could feel the saliva in her mouth boil and her body began to sear with pain. She closed her eyes, frantically working at the crank, around and around and around, until something jerked at her from underneath and her body sank back down to the floor.\n\nOf the three hundred or so who had left with the expedition, only three returned alive."
 empire_333.224.a: "Let’s not return there"

 empire_333.232.t: "A Precursor Planet"
 empire_333.232.d: "About half a day’s travel from the Zatsarya, next to a bountiful oasis, the Agradent colony was thriving. Guards accompanied caravans to and from the spire, as on more than one occasion the elves had attacked them mid-journey. Once you learned the terrain, finding watering holes for tchoken ranchers was relatively easy, and there were native fruits that were edible. Life was harsh on Agradent, and the dust was torture on the lungs, but there was a freedom living this far away from the homeland.\n\nThe lizardfolk skeleton found amongst the ruins on the opening expedition was the only sign of lizardfolk found anywhere on the planet. It appears whenever they lived on this planet, they had long since died out. Precursor ruins, on the other hand, were plentiful and bountiful. Trek out into the dusty barren landscape and one could uncover incredible treasures in abandoned towns and even cities filled with relics from the age of elves. They were clearly the same elves from Halann, although when their connection with our homeworld was severed remains unclear.\n\nThe most valuable materials found though were the remains of mines and manufacturies. While they had long since stopped operating, we were able to figure out they were constructing parts for new space pillars - parts clearly based on what was found in the Zatsarya. Perhaps Agradent could be more than a colony. It could be the key we’ve needed to repair more Zatsarya."
 empire_333.232.a: "Soon the stars will be ours!"

 empire_333.233.t: "Travelling Across Zulkanez"
 empire_333.233.d: "Crossing the icy abyss on Zulkanez could only be done by foot, as no animal was capable of handling the cold. Journeys were perilous and increasingly our colonists didn’t even attempt them. The few journeys we made were to the other side of the volcanic island to maintain contact with the natives. It was on one of these trips that we discovered they had their own method of travelling to different islands. A boat.\n\nThe boat was constructed out of a special metal with damestear veins running across it. These irradiated heat out of the boat and into the sea around it in a way that broke our understanding of physics, melting the water as the boat chugged slowly through the sea, only for the water to freeze again behind it. Powering this contraption was a large enclosed glass container. Inside, seemingly not minding the journey in the slightest and being thoroughly fed by the passengers, were those red hot shelled cats that wandered around the islands.\n\nWe later learned these boats were very rare and tended to follow strict, predetermined paths across the islands, and that the island we were on was especially remote. They were more akin to roaming caravans, except as one huge vessel that could house over a hundred lizards before feeling overcrowded. There was no permanent crew. Even the cats were often swapped out on each island. But this was how the islands stayed connected.\n\nOur engineers have been beside themselves with excitement. The design does not seem difficult to replicate, especially as some of the natives seem eager to travel back to Taneyas to help us with the design. It appears damestear is incredibly rare on Zulkanez, which makes manufacturing new ones difficult. But we have enough of a reserve - especially when considering our expeditions on other planets - that we could manufacture our own. We just need one of those hot shelled cats, which the island has plenty of. Soon we’ll be able to travel wherever we want."
 empire_333.233.a: "Soon Zulkanez will be open to us"

 empire_333.234.t: "The Bubble Cities"
 empire_333.234.d: "It took years after promising to return, but sure enough, when the natives of Shagatan returned they had their “bubble” in tow. There was really no other way to describe it. Measuring almost 30 meters in diameter, the bubble had several of the aquatic lizardfolk inside, who stepped out through the membrane into the sea to help our diplomats on board. Once everyone had sat down (very gingerly, fearing the transparent floor would simply give way beneath them), what appeared to be a mage started chanting under their breath and the bubble sank down under the ocean. Deeper and deeper, past the point where light reached from the surface of the water, until an incredible array of lights lit up their vision like it was daylight at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nGiant bubbles, far larger than the one they had travelled in, encased towns and villages, with lizardfolk swimming between them regularly. Our diplomatic envoy was greeted with a huge crowd, including a parade accompanied by a very strange gargling musical number. The meeting with the ruling council was difficult with the language barrier. As far as we could tell, they were all different representatives from different parts of the nation, and each seemed far more eager to show off how comparatively lavish their gift was, than to actually speak with us.\n\nThe last speaker really amped up the offerings, though, when they presented a group of about fifty lizardfolk and said they were all his gift. It was unclear in what context they were being offered. They may have been slaves. Or family members. Or warriors. Or intended to serve in a harem. Or all of the above. Or none and it was all metaphor; their language was difficult to parse. The 50-odd aquatic lizardfolk did not seem to be forced into the journey from their reactions. One final crowded bubble ride, one awkward walk up the hill path, and one turn of the Zatsarya crank later, and Kuvunika was now home to 50 new aliens."
 empire_333.234.a: "I hope they like it here"

 empire_333.235.t: "Seize the Damestear, Seize the Moon"
 empire_333.235.d: "We knew there was damestear here. We’d found the odd collection stored in containers across Téinglios, previously mined by the Precursors. But it wasn’t until we got the old mining equipment restarted that we realised just how much there might be.\n\nReactivating the mining operation was not easy. Leave the comfort of the main cavern, where all the old machines had been reactivated, and the toxic sparkling dust returned. The only lizardfolk who seemed unaffected by its impact were those with the rare Gasabi mutation, which raised more questions about the true nature of that mutation, the old cursed spire, and the nature of the Shadow Swamp that will no doubt confound scholars for centuries.\n\nBut none of that mattered, for once the first damestear vein was found, all worries were swept away. This entire moon had damestear veins as large as a Zatsarya. There was maybe more damestear in a single vein here than existed in the entirety of Sarhal."
 empire_333.235.a: "We’re going to be so rich!"

 empire_333.236.t: "A Festival for the Ages"
 empire_333.236.d: "A large bell rang out over the lands. At the new amphitheatre, the two new ruling monarchs stood in front of the crowd and raised their hands. On the left stood the princess of the ruling monarch, the very same who had greeted our explorers when they first arrived through the Zatsarya. On the right, holding her hand, stood the very first person she spoke to from Halann. The first lizardfolk from Halann to place his foot on the soil of Zangea, now king of this new realm, granted to the people of Halann.\n\nThe festival lasted days. Dignitaries from every corner of Zangea arrived, eager to extend their warmest greetings to the strange aliens that had defeated the evil wizard. Many of the veterans from Halann who had fought in the war had found love with native Zangeans, many of them during these festivities. Despite possibly tens of thousands of years of divergence between when our two people were last connected, we were still biologically compatible.\n\nThe princess let go of her husband’s hand to wave to the crowd. In her other arm she held a small lizardfolk. It had the same flat face of a Zangean, but its arms and legs were the longer proportions that marked it out as Halanni Lizardfolk. Or at least, half-Halanni."
 empire_333.236.a: "Good for her"

 empire_333.237.t: "A Colony on Atamumba"
 empire_333.237.d: "It was originally thought nobody would dare try to live on Atamumba. The Hivemind was still not fully understood, and some theorised that simply staying on the planet might infect the inhabitants again. For a nation as large as Khatalashya, however, barely 0.01% of the population need be mad enough to brave the unknown, to attempt settling on a planet that might infect your mind, for their numbers to be enough for a full colony. It’s how the other space colonies got started after all.\n\nFor those who did make the journey, they were richly rewarded. The many fields the Hivemind had ploughed were easy to commandeer and adapt. The homes were very bare and simple, but were sturdy and easy to move into once you removed the few bodies from the corners of the rooms. Sometimes one of the Hivemind lizardfolk would wander into the town, barely alive. Some would simply stand in place and scream. Others would just curl up in their old house, gnawing at their arms. Others would try to attack, although their attempts were erratic and generally ineffectual.\n\nSome were different though. One walked up the Zatsarya, brandishing a piece of cloth with an incredible drawing of the spire on it, its thousand stars depicted in a fashion that seemed to glint at night. Another started mimicking our settlers by helping out in the fields, bringing in the grain, copying our speech, sleeping in a bed left out for it. It was often left a wide berth, but during an early harvest celebration, it joined in with the dancing. Even in Taneyas there were reports of a group of them who had built their own boat on the Tressik Isles and sold fish at the local market, fish they had caught themselves.\n\nWhile they faced heavy ostracisation, especially across Taneyas which had borne the brunt of the damage during the Hivemind invasion, the other colonies had not seen fighting and were more willing to accept these strange yellow-scaled lizardfolk. It helped that their ability to fire the shards from their bodies made them excellent at defending the colonies from whatever other space monsters were out there."
 empire_333.237.a: "Is this safe?"


 empire_333.238.t: "Rakh"
 empire_333.238.d: "It was activated by accident. Not by one of the many engineers or archeologists scouring the remains of the great hall, but by one young laborer whose job was to cart materials out of the underground building. She had leant against a wall to catch her breath, but slipped and accidentally pushed a hidden lever. The entire hall lit up, stars sparkling from pillar to pillar, alighting different doorways, leading to even more halls. Beams of light shot across the room to project images across blank sections of wall in long dead languages. Beside each doorway, the unmistakable image of a Zatsarya shone, aligned with the starry symbology that adorned each one.\n\nOver the next several weeks, thousands of researchers pored over everything found in the giant hall. The leading theory was that this room was a central hub to visit many different Zatsarya. The theory was the main spire out of which we had stepped connected to more than one spire across the galaxy. If you analysed the images of Zatsarya along the walls, some of them clearly resembled those found on the many different planets we had visited. Perhaps somewhere in this chasm of dials and wheels and gears and lights, there lay a way to change the operation of the Zatsarya here so you could visit every one of these.\n\nIt was during these discoveries that the true extent of what we had found had become clear. If we assumed every single one of the different images of spires meant there was another planet on the other side (accounting for some destroyed or floating in space), then lizardfolk must have visited and settled on hundreds of planets - maybe even thousands. And they all led back to here. This planet. This hub from which everything was connected.\n\nAtop the central hub from which everything fanned out was written one word in the ancient lizardfolk language. Nobody had yet cracked the full code of the language; the script had changed, some of the letters changed entirely over the millennia. But this one word had somehow not changed one iota in the tens of thousands of years our kind had been disconnected from this planet. Our planet: Rakh."

Still, what area of land we control in these new worlds is very small, and we need new bodies acclimated to these worlds, ones for whom these worlds have always been their home. In the lizardfolk language we call this feeling “rakh” - the feeling of belonging where you live.\n\nThe best way to do this is to have lizardfolk eggs hatch on these new worlds. The smallest eggs of a clutch have historically rarely been allowed to hatch in lizardfolk society. Only the very wealthy would keep the smallest of the litter. But we are a wealthy nation now, and one with a dire need for new lizardfolk to populate entire new planets.

Yet despite all these problems, the letters being sent back by the Shagatan natives who moved to our world are full of nothing but praise for life here. They regularly talk about how much they love living in the coastal villages, swimming off the coast of East Sarhal and enjoying the local cuisine… especially the latter. It seems the taste for fried tchoken is universal amongst lizardfolk no matter what planet they’re from.

A common sight on Shagatan are groups of people gathered around one cat sleeping in the street, using its intense radiating heat for warmth. Such gatherings are effectively communal social events and have helped foster a strong sense of community in the harsh living conditions.\n\nThe problems began, though, when someone tried to transport one back to Gamyi.\n\nThe cat itself seemed unbothered by the trip. The city though did not appreciate a creature that could cause buildings to catch fire simply by standing near them.

It was a transparent box, wide enough that the cat could pace around without issue, with the transparency allowing those outside to see it. It had to be carried via long metal poles with insulators on either end, preventing it from overheating so it could be carried.\n\nThe first demonstration of the red hot cats in Gamyi attracted a huge crowd. To ensure everyone got a chance to see it, four lizardfolk hoisted the box using the poles and paraded it through the streets. Thousands of people gathered to watch the procession.

 empire_333.268.a: "Those blasted elves!"

 empire_333.269.t: "Cocons of Romutha"
 empire_333.269.d: "The mystery of the monstrously dangerous giant butterflies on Romutha has been solved - or at least, where they come from. They appear to have formed in a similar fashion to butterflies in our own world. A larval form of the creature consumes large amounts of food, before cocooning itself to begin a stage of metamorphosis to finally emerge in its winged adult form. The candidate for its larval form was obviously the giant caterpillars that roamed the countryside and had a tendency to alarm farmers when their winding paths careened towards their crops, but it took a long time to locate any of them in their cocoon stage.\n\nResearchers had been following the caterpillars for years, and finally discovered where it was they cocooned. Once they have eaten enough, they head deep into the harsh rocky mountains until they find a vent, then burrow underground to form a cocoon.\n\nWhile all fascinating, what has alarmed people of Romutha is a new idea from the researchers: what if they brought the cocoon back to the colony? They believe that if they can hatch the cocoon by themselves, it may be possible to tame the giant, laser-shooting butterflies for our purposes. This has not gone over well with the colonists, who have insisted the cocoon be kept far outside their settlement."
 empire_333.269.a: "I foresee no way this plan could ever fail"

 empire_333.270.t: "Giant Laser Shooting Butterflies"
 empire_333.270.d: "It had been a while since a report from Romutha had crossed the desk of the $MONARCHTITLE$. This one, though, caused [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to sprint out of their quarters and demand the fastest carriage to Zerat. What on earth were they thinking? How could they even think to unleash such a beast here on Halann? Who knew what untold devastation it could cause?\n\nEven before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had reached the spire, they could see it. The terrifying beast, fluttering high above the spire that overlooked the city, the glittering of wings catching the sunlight. $MONARCH$ flinched every time the light flashed in the direction of their carriage. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had read the reports. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] knew what those things were capable of.\n\nWhen the carriage screeched into the clearing in front of the great spire, a strange lizardfolk wearing oversized gnomish-made spectacles greeted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with a look of sheer delight across their face. “Ah my $MONARCHTITLE$, so glad you could be here on such short notice. The experiment was a success. We already have multiple cocoons waiting to be hatched back on Romutha. To control it, all you need is this little gnomish light beam and skobobodiboo, as the gnomes would say.”\n\nBefore $MONARCH$ could protest, the scientist turned and clicked a small button on the contraption that he was holding. It shone a tiny red light onto the mountain behind. The great butterfly overhead let out a terrifying screech, its wings lighting up, before unleashing a beam of light so destructive it carved a hole deep into the mountain."
 empire_333.270.a: "You’re saying we now have multiple of these?"

 estate_church_wishcatcher_mutation_desc: "The Wishcatcher is unassuming at first glance. Slightly smaller than the average lizardfolk, its only distinguishing feature is a large neck frill that unfurls when it desires to eat the arcane. How this process works is not fully understood. It can eat both wish magic, standard magic, and even chi magic, which has confounded scholars and implies there may be some kind of universal magic theory that binds all types of magic on Halann."

No armor has a hope in deflecting the shards each one can grow and fire at will. With the voice of the Hivemind no longer rattling around their skulls, many have taken to unique acts of individualism to come to terms with their new freedom. Many have turned to crafts and arts, although their work tends to be very derivative. It may take a few generations before they are used to the whole concept of thinking for themselves."

 empire_333.350.t: "The Zatsarya Fails"
 empire_333.350.d: "A full battalion of only the most elite in our military had jammed themselves into the Zatsarya in the Shadow Swamp to prepare for a return visit. But the crank would not work. Multiple engineers, scientists, and various experts all tried to work out what was happening. Perhaps something had gone wrong? Perhaps one of the many strange gears and magical doodads that inhabited this incredible spire had broken? In truth, although we had activated multiple of these spires now, we did not really understand the machinery behind them. There were books on what happened if you moved certain gears to certain places, but it obeyed a logic nobody truly understood, and operated under magical laws to which nobody had cracked the code.\n\nSo the soldiers were forced to leave while the engineers tried to trial and error their way back to operation. One gear moved here, but to no effect. Another one turned a mysterious crank no previous spire engineer had dared touch in other spires, but that too accomplished nothing. Another junior engineer grabbed a lever and flipped it upwards.\n\nClicking. Sparks. Voices. Thunks of flesh on stone. More clicking. The spire had not activated. There were no sparkling lights of the thousands stars on its face. But something had gone very wrong. Nothing was leaving the spire. Nothing that is, but the ceaseless sounds of clicking."

 empire_333.351.d: "A large army had gathered around Tovchihesu, armed with the finest weapons Khatalashya could equip them with. The clicking from the spire could be heard from a distance, but if anything had left the structure, there were no sign of them between the murky branches of the Shadow Swamp. Although it also had to be said, the Shadow Swamp was a much more beautiful place than when it was inhabited solely by trolls. Flowers bloomed on the trees. Monkeys darted between the branches, while tchoken wandered aimlessly between the pools of water.\n\n”I might move here after I’ve finished serving”. A soldier tossed small stones idly into the pool, he and his friend both trying to get the closest to hitting the sole lilypad floating in the center. “I feel like I’ll never change if I don’t move from Khugra.” His friend nodded and tossed a stone of his own, narrowly missing the lilypad. “I know what you mean. It’s like, you know, being a lizardfolk.” He gestured around aimlessly. He was never great with words. “It’s like we’re not meant to never change, you get me?”\n\n”I get you.” He hurled another stone towards the lilypad, missing by a wide margin and startling a nearby frog. “It’s why we look so different from our parents. It’s why mutations exist. We’re meant to change.” He hurled another stone, finally landing right in the middle of the lilypad. “Nice throw-”\n\nClicking. Every direction. Louder and louder and relentless. Flashes of pink and yellow. Screams and wild blind musketfire, catching nothing but bark and air. The echoes of the gunfire faded. The screams faded. Only the clicking remained."

It took about twenty-five hours to reach the mountain, although the sun never set - it seemed days were longer on this planet. They met little resistance along the way, in part because any time one tried to get close, the Gasabi would start speaking as the Hivemind and the alien lizard’s position would be given away immediately.\n\nOnce the team found the hub from which all this terror was being disseminated, it was almost anti-climactic. It was just an unremarkable rock, large to be sure, buried into the earth. There were only three signs it was anything unnatural. First was that it glowed faintly yellow. Second was that if one stood close to it, one could make out thousands of small clicking sounds. The final sign was that once the team started laying the explosives around the rock, the Gasabi started screaming.\n\n£i_N££i_O£ £i_N££i_O£ £i_t££i_h££i_e££i_y£ £i_b££i_r££i_i££i_n££i_g£ £i_F££i_I££i_R££i_E£ £i_t££i_h££i_e££i_y£ £i_b££i_u££i_r££i_n£ £i_k££i_i££i_l££i_l£ £i_d££i_e££i_s££i_t££i_r££i_o££i_y£ £i_K££i_I££i_L££i_L£ £i_K££i_I££i_L££i_L£ £i_s££i_t££i_o££i_p£ £i_t££i_h££i_e££i_m£ £i_N££i_O££i_W£ £i_t££i_h££i_e££i_y£ £i_a££i_r££i_e£ £i_D££i_I££i_F££i_F££i_E££i_R££i_E££i_N££i_T£ £i_t££i_h££i_e£ £i_D££i_I££i_S££i_S££i_O££i_N££i_A££i_N££i_T£ £i_v££i_o££i_i££i_c££i_e£ £i_o££i_n££i_e£ £i_v££i_o££i_i££i_c££i_e£ £i_u££i_s£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_S££i_T££i_O££i_P£ £i_S££i_T££i_O££i_P£ £i_t££i_h££i_e££i_y£ £i_h££i_e££i_a££i_r£ £i_u££i_s£ £i_t££i_h££i_e££i_y£ £i_w££i_i££i_l££i_l£ £i_e££i_n££i_d£ £i_N££i_O£ £i_i££i_t£ £i_w££i_i££i_l££i_l£ £i_e££i_n££i_d£ £i_a££i_l££i_l£ £i_e££i_n££i_d£ £i_a££i_l££i_l£ £i_o££i_v££i_e££i_r£ £i_N££i_O£ £i_N££i_O£ £i_i££i_t£ £i_c££i_a££i_n££i_n££i_o££i_t£ £i_s££i_t££i_o££i_p£ £i_u££i_s£ £i_U££i_S£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_a££i_r££i_e£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_S££i_A£-"

 empire_333.359.t: "The Final Empire?"
 empire_333.359.d: "What felled the 332nd Empire? It was an invasion from the Shadow Swamp by lizardfolk who they could not communicate nor reason with. When the hulking Ashhana burst out of the swamp and slaughtered all in their path, the empire was split in two and never recovered.\n\nWhen the 24th Empire collapsed, it was when some invading force arrived through the Zatsarya. Records differ on what beings burst forth, although some did say they resembled lizardfolk. Does this mean the 24th Empire was real?\n\nNo. Not because their story doesn’t make sense, but because do we really think it was the 24th Empire? Do we think the last empire was the 332nd? What we are going through is just another empire collapse, like both the 24th and 332nd, or whatever numbers they truly were. We thought we were different. We thought we had counted correctly. What fools we were."

 empire_333.361.d: "When the lone Gasabi at court started to scream, [Root.Monarch.GetName] shuddered. With everything that had happened since the venture onto that cursed planet, it was hard not to wonder if the doom that ‘cursed’ mutation had long been feared to bring had finally arrived.\n\nThe shock quickly faded, though, along with any fear it sparked. Faded, and was replaced by fascination -- for it was not panic or terror driving the black-scaled lizardman to scream. It was not even clear he had a choice in the matter at all. After all, the scream was made up of words. Strange words, spoken in a rush, punctuated by even louder screams -- but words all the same.\n\n£i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_a££i_r££i_e£ £i_G££i_L££i_O££i_R££i_I££i_O££i_U££i_S£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_a££i_r££i_e£ £i_s££i_p££i_o££i_r££i_e£-£i_y££i_e££i_l££i_l££i_o££i_w£ £i_a££i_n££i_d£ £i_g££i_r££i_e££i_e££i_n£-£i_f££i_l££i_e££i_s££i_h£ £i_a££i_n££i_d£ £i_b££i_o££i_n££i_e£-£i_w££i_h££i_i££i_t££i_e£ £i_a££i_n££i_d£ £i_o££i_n££i_e£ £i_a££i_n££i_d£ £i_a££i_l££i_l£ £i_a££i_r££i_e£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_f££i_i££i_g££i_h££i_t£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_w££i_a££i_r£ £i_w££i_e£ £i_W££i_I££i_N£ £i_a££i_l££i_l£ £i_w££i_i££i_l££i_l£ £i_b££i_e£ £i_y££i_e££i_l££i_l££i_o££i_w£ £i_g££i_r££i_e££i_e££i_n£ £i_b££i_l££i_a££i_c££i_k£ £i_a££i_l££i_l£ £i_w££i_i££i_l££i_l£ £i_b££i_e£ £i_u££i_s£ £i_a££i_l££i_l£ £i_w££i_i££i_l££i_l£ £i_b££i_e£ £i_S££i_A££i_M££i_E£\n\nAt this point, the poor Gasabi’s voice gave out. Some advisors are quick to assure [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that must have been some strange manifestation of their curse. But [Root.GetName] knows better. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has fought those clicking creatures on the battlefield. We have won, and more often, we have lost. But we have never had a chance to truly know their foe -- until the glimpse we got today.\n\nAnd if a thousand thousand years proved anything -- what we know, we can understand"

Shivering under a blanket, the black-scaled lizardfolk looked up at the $MONARCHTITLE$. “They think as one. It’s one thought, screaming their heads endlessly. I think they attacked us because when we entered their world, our voice was different. I don’t know why they chased us here though.

He took a few deep breaths, then lowered his hands again. “There’s a central hub through which all thoughts seem to pass through. A spore hive, or something of that sort. If you can get back through that spire, I will be able to lead you to it. I don’t know what you do then though. Use explosives?"

The Hivemind cannot handle whenever we do something different. Whenever they are forced to fight a different type of lizardfolk with a different sort of mutation from the last fight, they lose their composure and freeze in place. Their anger is palpable, and it gives us strength. The lizardfolk of Taneyas and beyond are starting to believe."
