 shadowswamp.101.t:0 "The Black Coffee Jitters"
 shadowswamp.101.d:0 "The people of Sarhal are no strangers to coffee. From the plentiful coffee of the Balawamuni coast to the famed “Sun Coffee” of Azka-Sur, the drink stands as part of daily life… At least for those that can afford it. In the Shadow Swamp a cultivar of coffee exists that is not imbued with the brine of the salty Balawamuni shores or the fine roasting of the Bulwari sun, but with decay and shadows. Legends state the bean was a product of magic and breeding by the Coven of Yezel Mora themselves. Balawamuni traders even tell ancient tales of hags sweeping down on the coast to steal the precious plant from its ordained home. What is certain is that this coffee, colloquially called Black Coffee for its pitch black color even before roasting, provides a much greater stimulant effect than other variants. However, the strangeness of this coffee makes it very difficult for our non-native farmers to grow successfully."
 shadowswamp.101.a:0 "Damn this cursed swamp!"
 shadowswamp.101.b:0 "Admit defeat and ask for help from local experts."
 shadowswamp.101.c:0 "With the matriarch purified, we have gained many insights into this swamp."
 shadowswamp.101.e:0 "Luckily we know just how this coffee is grown."

 shadowswamp.102.t:0 "The Fire's Caterwaul"
 shadowswamp.102.d:0 "The Blood Palm of the Shadow Delta is a common enough tree for those living in and around the Shadow Swamp. Often prized for a oily crimson sap useful as fuel and cooking fat alike, the tree has one peculiar property: when burned, it makes a faint screaming noise. With little dry ground to settle on in the swamp, a small hamlet has sprung up in an elevated copse of Blood Palm. This proximity was practical enough for the villagers until an errant spark of a cook's hearth started a small fire. When would-be rescuers arrived, the screeching of the boiling palm oil could not be distinguished from the cries of the could-be survivors. Farmhands hacked down shed walls, only to find a flaming stack of wood instead of the crying babe they thought they'd heard. The screams of a family went ignored because they were trapped in a cellar, presumed to have been nothing more than a burning pile of stored wood. Many more perished than typical for a fire of this size."
 shadowswamp.102.a:0 "At least this cleared the land..."
 shadowswamp.102.b:0 "Use this as an opportunity to let the farmers plant for themselves!"

 shadowswamp.103.t:0 "Lurkers in Foul Water"
 shadowswamp.103.d:0 ""There it is! Dig that trench a little deeper, boys. The field's almost drained." called the foreman to his workhands, swatting at the incessant flies buzzing around his face. \n\nIt had been weeks of backbreaking digging and log felling, but the task of damming a small section of swamp was almost complete. While the paltry incline provided little more than a slightly shallower pit of mud, it was the closest thing to a hill the villagers had seen for miles. Here, they would plant their personal gardens to provide sustenance while the scant share of easily arable land was claimed by those with more coin or men. \n\nAs the hands shifted a massive log of jagged palm into place, the foreman spotted movement just beyond the frantic activity. What initially looked like a cloud of swamp gas came into focus as a pocked mass surrounded by a swarm of insects. They emerged from an irregular lattice-work of cavities on a giant creature's head and back, reminiscent of maggots teeming from a block of rotted cheese. In seconds, the faces of the workmen were engulfed by the spindly-bodied insects, which gnashed at their quarries' eyes. Just as the workers were overwhelmed, a massive jaw snapped the leg off of the foremost man. Blinded by the bloodflies, none escaped the jaws of the disturbed crocodilians who made their home beside the now dry patch of land."
 shadowswamp.103.a:0 "Forego this foolish endeavor in this forsaken swamp."
 shadowswamp.103.b:0 "Build fortifications with the help of the locals. We will tame this hellish bog."
 shadowswamp.103.c:0 "These creatures will wreak havoc on our enemies."
 shadowswamp.103.e:0 "Let a tribe deal with them; they can keep this ugly patch of mire."
 shadowswamp.103.f:0 "Let the adventurers deal with them; they can keep this ugly patch of mire."

 shadowswamp.104.t:0 "The Last Wish"
 shadowswamp.104.d:0 "Among the strange and shadow-touched flora and fauna of the Shadow Swamp, The Last Wish is among the most otherworldly and dangerous. This common bud looks no different from an average flower, save the monochrome palette that afflicts everything endemic to the swamp. However, when disturbed, hallucinogenic pollen fills the air and puts any unfortunate enough to breathe it into a comatose state. The few who have survived this describe a dreaming fugue, laden with multitudinous pleasures, but more often than not all that remains of the Wish's victim is a decomposed corpse set upon by the swamp and its creatures. It seems villagers all around the province are being drawn in great numbers to this flower and falling prey to the swamp."
 shadowswamp.104.a:0 "What do you expect when you settle in a cursed swamp?"
 shadowswamp.104.b:0 "With the swamp tamed, we can harvest this plant."
 shadowswamp.104.c:0 "Send a regiment to deal with this... And tie cloths around their mouths."
 shadowswamp.104.e:0 "Why not turn a profit on this plant?"

 shadowswamp.105.t:0 "Undead Swarm [Root.GetName]"
 shadowswamp.105.d:0 "The veil between planes is at its thinnest in the Shadow Swamp, and small disturbances can temporarily shear that veil. A thunderstorm has passed through the province and brought forth malevolent spirits from the Shadow Plane. Seizing the corpses of deceased men and swamp creatures alike, these spirits have begun attacking our settlements in the area."
 shadowswamp.105.a:0 "Hire some adventurers."
 shadowswamp.105.b:0 "Set the tribes on them."
 shadowswamp.105.c:0 "This is what pitchforks are for."

 shadowswamp.106.t:0 "The Shambling Mounds"
 shadowswamp.106.d:0 "As the sprawling, diseased limbs of the Shadowroot Matriarch continue to hang over large swathes of the swamp, her fruits fall among our people. Unlike the fruits of common trees, these giant fig-like bodies drop to the ground and quickly turn from pliable flesh to a tangled mass that appears more human than fruit. They then proceed to lash out at any passers-by unfortunate enough to cross their paths. While immobile, these mounds clog the roads, canals and fields and must be dealt with. A common tactic is fire, but this costs manpower and resources, even more so in the dank swamp. The other option is to let nature, or what passes for nature in this place, take its course. Horncaps and other fungi will deal with the mounds in time."
 shadowswamp.106.a:0 "Organize regular foraging parties to reach them before they grow."
 shadowswamp.106.b:0 "Ask the natives to burn them!"
 shadowswamp.106.c:0 "Have our bravest prove themselves with fire and burn them to the ground!"
 shadowswamp.106.e:0 "Let nature take its course."

 shadowswamp.107.t:0 "Nightmares"
 shadowswamp.107.d:0 "[GetShadowswampNightmares] \n\nThen the village awoke. Were these dreams harbingers of doom to come, or just illusions spurred by the deceitful magic of the swamp? Those with means have begun to leave in boats and on horseback, while those without are packing up their meagre belongings and trying to leave on foot using ill-constructed roads and paths. How should this be dealt with?"
 shadowswamp_nightmares_desc_a:0 "The voice would not stop. All in the village now heard it. What it commanded was unthinkable, but the alternative was utter destruction… to sacrifice one child a night lest the beast savage the entire town. Third and fourth children were judged as chaff to be discarded into the maw of the monster's incessant gnashing jaws. Riders for help never returned. Neighbors turned on neighbors. Madness spread until the village consumed itself in fires and fratricide, even before the beast had the chance to satiate its hunger."
 shadowswamp_nightmares_descr_b:0 "The village green was surrounded. The quivering masses of sinewy tendrils ran from the top of the squat crier's tower to hundreds of heaps on the ground. What were those featureless masses? They looked like clumps of worms, or arteries. But when one looked at them, ecstasy burned in their gorge. The urge to touch them, become one with them, was overwhelming. Villagers plunged their hands into the masses. They cried out as they covered themselves with the tendrils. Finally, the village green was silent once more, save for the faint rustling of even more quivering masses."
 shadowswamp_nightmares_desc_c:0 "Too many eyes. An impossible number of legs. None could catch more than a mere glimpse of the creature's matted coat of quill-like hair as it bounded out of the village. What was seen clearly, was the remains of the victims. Sinews of livestock hide draped from the fences of their pens. A liver, likely human, half devoured and left in a puddle to rot. Too many dead. No place to run."
 shadowswamp.107.a:0 "Let them leave if they are not brave enough."
 shadowswamp.107.b:0 "They are in the swamp for a reason, they stay!"
 shadowswamp.107.c:0 "With the Shadowroot Matriarch purified, we can now explain the source of these dreams."
 shadowswamp.107.e:0 "Let us discuss the portents of these dreams."

 shadowswamp.108.t:0 "A Break in the Grey"
 shadowswamp.108.d:0 "The first thing any inhabitant of the Shadow Swamp must get used to is the complete lack of color caused by the swamp's pigment-devouring magic. Those who have lived their whole lives there think stories of green grass and blue sky little more than tales to enchant children. The only proof of the world of color beyond the grey swamp is the tchoken, a squat lizard-like creature with vividly colored scales. Considered one of the stupidest of Hallan's creatures, what the tchoken lacks in simple awareness it makes up for in hardiness in the form of immunity to almost all magic. These bumbling creatures seldom wander into the Shadow Swamp, but when they do, they stand out as a bastion of green life against the drab surroundings. \n\nWhile carrying out the tasks of their daily drudgery, a group of villagers chanced across one of these tchoken beaming through the ashen mire. These morose denizens of the swamp beg to have the tchoken captured and brought into their homes as a symbol of the colorful life of the outside world."
 shadowswamp.108.a:0 "We will aid in its capture."
 shadowswamp.108.b:0 "If you like them so much, we will buy you a herd."
 shadowswamp.108.c:0 "Bring some tchoken from outside herders… as a gift to the crown."
 shadowswamp.108.e:0 "Back to work in your grey swamp."

 shadowswamp.109.t:0 "A Break in the Grey"
 shadowswamp.109.d:0 " "ITS… NOT THIS" \n\nOotz exclaimed, waiving his hands about at his surroundings. \n\n "ITS… BRIGHT!" \n\nOotz had been going on about this bright creature all night, and the other trolls were tiring of his insistence that something exists here that is full of… color. Even the concept of color was not one a swamp troll often had to contend with, having been born in the monochrome Yezel Mora. Raiding parties and warbands often told tales of the brightness outside, but those were things for burning and looting, unbecoming of the swamp itself. \n\nRegardless, Ootz would not shut up. \n\nAnd who could say? Maybe this bright creature would make for a tasty lunch."
 shadowswamp.109.a:0 "We will have a delectable meal."
 shadowswamp.109.b:0 "Maybe we can turn its hide into a flag to prove our mastery of the outside world?"

 shadowswamp.110.t:0 "Hattiatia Grove Discovered"
 shadowswamp.110.d:0 "All throughout the swamp, alien flora and fauna befog our people. However, not all of these mysteries are wholly destructive. Hattiatia, which grows as a vine among the towering Lotunga pine, is used as a smoking herb among magic-users and spiritualists. However, too much use leaves the body necrotized, with the mind having wandered to the Shadow Plane itself. Careful harvesting of Hattiatia will allow us to court favor among those who desire to meddle with the herb."
 shadowswamp.110.a:0 "Let us harvest the root for our Mages."
 shadowswamp.110.b:0 "Let us sell the plant to the highest bidder."
 shadowswamp.110.c:0 "Can we propagate their growth?"
 shadowswamp.110.e:0 "Let us give the trove to our tribes."

 shadowswamp.111.t:0 "Kindred Spirits"
 shadowswamp.111.d:0 ""I swear, it was just right there!" said the man carrying his flute as a club. "Did nobody else see it?"\n\n This had been going on for most of the day's journey on the narrow road in the swamp. It seemed that every few strides one of the traveling minstrels would shout about someone lurking just in the distance. While minstrels are fanciful folk prone to wild imaginings, especially in a place such as the Shadow Swamp, the increasing frequency of these sightings had grown worrisome. Upon finally reaching their destination, the minstrel band sang many tales of the companions they had on the road. The more adventurous listeners have taken these tales to mean that the companion spirits were trying to lead the minstrels to treasures. Should we outfit a band to seek these spirits?"
 shadowswamp.111.a:0 "Since the matriarch has been purified these spirits are exceedingly rare. Follow them!"
 shadowswamp.111.b:0 "Seek out this treasure... for the crown, of course."
 shadowswamp.111.c:0 "Let the locals handle this."

 shadowswamp.112.t:0 "Fetid Dreams"
 shadowswamp.112.d:0 "Another night, and more reports of overwhelming dread in our subjects' sleep. In the Shadow Swamp, nightmares are as common as the trees are grey. They usually are not accompanied by an intense scent of decaying flesh, though. Something has perished in great numbers in the province, and the slime mold known as Ghost's Breath has seemingly taken refuge in every fallen tree and puddle of mud in the area. There are several remedies to this infestation, but none of them are easy. Or cheap."
 shadowswamp.112.a:0 "Burn the mold back."
 shadowswamp.112.b:0 "Surely it will go away on its own."
 shadowswamp.112.c:0 "Have the locals deal with this."
 shadowswamp.112.e:0 "The trolls will harvest the beads of mold."

 shadowswamp.113.t:0 "Death Vultures Swarm Battlefield"
 shadowswamp.113.d:0 "The devastation of the past months in [Root.GetName] have taken a major toll on the population. While life in the Shadow Swamp is never easy, when war and famine come the trials and tribulations of the residents increase tenfold. The swamp rarely aids her denizens. There are times where the swamp does provide, though. Death Vultures, seemingly normal vultures that have mutated from contact with the shadows of the swamp to spew necrotic breath, have arrived to clean up the death and destruction from our fields. These beasts will even consume the flesh of the trolls."
 shadowswamp.113.a:0 "The vultures will feast on the remnants of our suffering."

 shadowswamp.114.t:0 "The Lights of Industry"
 shadowswamp.114.d:0 "Innovation is the light that guides progress, but this metaphorical light will not guide one in a very real, and very dark, swamp. For that we need actual light! Luckily, the swamp provides just this in the form of Dead Man's Lantern. This bulb emits a faint light that often attracts the flying insects of the swamp. In great enough numbers, and kept indoors, these plants transform from a bug-attracting peculiarity to a true source of light one could work by. Throughout [Root.GetName], shopkeepers, tavern owners and overseers alike are using Dead Man's Lantern to light the night. This is wonderful for the local economy, but should we stop there?"
 shadowswamp.114.a:0 "Let us spread this idea throughout our nation."
 shadowswamp.114.b:0 "Let them keep their fancy lights."

 shadowswamp.115.t:0 "Crouching Coeurl"
 shadowswamp.115.d:0 "Townsfolk have been reporting the feeling of being watched. This is not limited to farmers in their fields; common reports of this same feeling come from those working in the center of towns. With all of the magic of the Shadow Swamp, being stalked by a spirit is usually not a major concern, until claw marks and pools of blood start appearing where a person once stood. Plucked from this plane to another, people are disappearing at an alarming rate and the culprit seems to be a Coeurl. This big cat is native to the Shadow Plane, but hunts in our world."
 shadowswamp.115.a:0 "Let us hunt it ourselves."
 shadowswamp.115.b:0 "We can trap this beast in the material realm to prove our might!"
 shadowswamp.115.c:0 "Well as long as it stays in the swamp, the locals can deal with it."

 shadowswamp.116.t:0 "Swamp Lobster"
 shadowswamp.116.d:0 "A curious bard's song from the swamp has started to reach our court. This bard, who goes by the name Bard-tholomew the 52nd, tells a story of some fortuitous settlers and a new delicacy: \n\nUpon the beach of a mirky pool,\n\nWith towels matched, the color of jewels,\n\nA brave soul ventured under a dock,\n\nTo which they spied a humble rock,\n\nYet a stone so still this did not be,\n\nFor it was the Swamp Lobster they spotted with glee!\n\n Accompanying tales tell of settlers finding hundreds of these small crustaceans. These delicious morsels, more a giant crayfish than a true lobster, are said to be raising the morale of all and may even act as an aphrodisiac."
 shadowswamp.116.a:0 "An aphrodisiac? Send some to my Courtship Cabin."
 shadowswamp.116.b:0 "Throw a banquet with the new delicacy of the swamp."

 shadowswamp.117.t:0 "In Search of the Perfect Life"
 shadowswamp.117.d:0 "A body has been discovered, seemingly hastily shoved into a barrel alongside salt-tchoken provisions. Identification of the corpse is proving impossible, as the face has been completely removed and all identifying features burned. This is the second body discovered this month that cannot be identified."
 shadowswamp.117.a:0 "Ominous..."

 shadowswamp.118.t:0 "More Mutilated Corpses"
 shadowswamp.118.d:0 "A pattern seems to be emerging. A body is found. All jewelry and clothing has been removed. The head is shorn. The face destroyed beyond any hope of recognition. Several days to weeks later, somebody is reported missing. Somebody who was just there the day before. The Shadow Swamp contains many oddities, but we are most certain that time-travelling corpses is not one of them.\n\nNow a magistrate of our courts has been reported missing just hours after giving judgement on a series of cases. It seems that his body was discovered over a week ago, now identified by his wife due to a burn on the bottom of his foot that was luckily left behind. This has led our team to suspect an Alter Ego; a spirit that perfectly assumes the identity of their target: form, mind, and memories. Indistinguishable from the one they mimic, these Alter Egos apparently can go on living the life of their victim for years without anybody knowing. If these tales are true, it seems we are faced with a rather indecisive specimen. Unable to find a life that suits them, our Alter Ego has been hopping between lives at all levels of society at an alarming rate. The creature does have one weakness, though, it is prone to making mistakes when cornered. It seems our only path forward is to lay a trap."
 shadowswamp.118.a:0 "We must investigate further."
 shadowswamp.118.b:0 "This is none of our concern."
 shadowswamp.118.c:0 "This calls for magical intervention."
 shadowswamp.118.e:0 "A band of adventurers should do the trick."


 shadowswamp.119.t:0 "The Disappearances Continue..."
 shadowswamp.119.d:0 "The mutilated corpses have not stopped turning up, but we have turned a blind eye to them. Now it seems one of our finest subjects has suffered this fate."
 shadowswamp.119.a:0 "How long have they been dead for?"
 shadowswamp.119.b:0 "We must finally investigate."
 shadowswamp.119.c:0 "This calls for magical intervention."
 shadowswamp.119.e:0 "A band of adventurers should do the trick."

 shadowswamp.120.t:0 "Cornered at Last"
 shadowswamp.120.d:0 "Our investigation has finally led to concrete evidence. Our monster hunters were able to put together a meeting of some of the richest and most powerful subjects of our nation in order to entice the beast. Once the meeting began our investigators pounced on the guests. Doors were barred and people were separated and interrogated. As the panic in the room intensified, our quarry finally cracked. A man sprung to his feet and attempted to flee, but our guards were able to accost him. We have finally captured the cunning creature."
 shadowswamp.120.a:0 "Turn this monstrosity into a public spectacle."
 shadowswamp.120.b:0 "Give this anomaly to our mages to study."
 shadowswamp.120.c:0 "Kill it and confiscate the wealth it has amassed."
 shadowswamp.120.e:0 "Can you assume the identity of our richest and funnel us their gold?"
