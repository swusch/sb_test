 ### Events ###
 shuvuush.0.t:0 "Swapping Your Mask"
 shuvuush.0.d:0 "Which mask you wear is of great importance to the Shuvüüsh, as it signifies several things: first, it determines who you are representing at the moment: whether clan heads choose to wear their clan mask, or their personal one, is often a matter of petty political importance. It signifies whose counsel you are accepting at the moment, as you may speak to the spirit(s) inside the mask (if there are any present).\n\nSome are greatly constant in their choice of mask. Shamans in particular never switch their mask, with black-masked death-priests and white-masked medicine-men making their positions in society clear at all times. For others, they change which mask they wear frequently, displaying with pride the great range of options they have access to. Yet others only wear the clan masks for special occasions, unable to bear the bickering between family spirits. A sign of a functional family can be determined by how frequently its head chooses to represent its members."

 shuvuush.1.t:0 "The Faceless Queen"
 shuvuush.1.d:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai have long been the most powerful clan of the Shuvüüsh, though it has stood fractured since the Sun Elves reigned over us, their officials fostering rivalries between the minor clans to keep us divided and weak. What was once the terror of Yanshen devolved into warring clans, families, tribes and hordes more of a threat to themselves than anybody else.\n\nRecently we have seen the rise of Kusheng Nurgai of the Bagaatun clan, who aspires to one day become the Izhuun, or perhaps even Kaasheg. Uniting the warring clans under her command, she wears today not the mask of the Bagaatun clan, but her own personal mask: a stark, faceless design, wood stained with bone. She intends on forging her own legacy, her own family, her own empire. Today, she takes the first steps towards achieving that goal."
 shuvuush.1.a:0 "Long reign Nurgai, the Nuugdan Kusheng!"
 nuugdan_raze_hint:0 "Before we begin, we should consider dealing with our new conquests in the south by §Rrazing them to the ground§! and §Ruprooting their expensive forts§!!"

 shuvuush.2.t:0 "More Than A Queen"
 shuvuush.2.d:0 "With the unfortunate passing of the great conqueror Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun, the Shuvüüsh people have lost one of their finest. As thousands make their way to Zougzengom to visit her grave and pay their respects, the locals begin constructing a temple around it. Whilst the people were in mourning however, the shamans of the Saanorgegh communities were busy asking the spirit world for guidance.\n\nTo their surprise a familiar voice answered. The Faceless Queen is still alive, in the heavens! She has ascended to godhood according to a majority of the shaman and in her honor a new mask has been carved to be laid upon her grave, one devoid of all details, a true faceless mask for a faceless queen.\n\nSeveral rumors are floating around the clans, such as that she has married one of the three brothers, with shamans bickering about which one it could be. She is quickly becoming the preferred deity for all Shuvüüsh women as they pray to her for guidance.\n\n§R The Faceless Queen is now available as a personal deity to all QUEENS who control her temple in Zougzengom.§!"
 shuvuush.2.a:0 "A new god for all Shuvüüsh"

 shuvuush.3.t:0 "Arable Land in Shuvüüshudi"
 shuvuush.3.d:0 "(Placeholder) new developments in irrigation and land-tilling has allowed for iron plows to break the tough soil of Gozengun, resulting in an extremely arable clime developing from what once was grasslands. This will cause a great conflict between traditional, nomadic ways of life and new settled culture"
 shuvuush.3.a:0 "Unimplemented Beyond This Point"
 
 shuvuush.4.t:0 "Elevating Clan Leaders To Nobility"
 shuvuush.4.d:0 "With the recent formalization of the Nobility Estate, the countless clan leaders are demanding titles and privileges similar to those the Gowon and Yan nobles enjoy. We have elevated the most prominent clan leaders, but we can opt to allow even lesser clan leaders to join the nobility, for a price."
 shuvuush.4.a:0 "Sell no additional titles"
 shuvuush.4.b:0 "Sell a few titles"
 shuvuush.4.c:0 "Sell a bunch of titles"
 shuvuush.4.e:0 "Sell a ridiculous amount of titles, and secretly give discounts to those who need it"
 
 shuvuush.5.t:0 "The Fear Of Yanshen"
 shuvuush.5.d:0 "Through our relentless conquest of some of the most vital cities of Yanshen, we have shown ourselves to be ultimately successful in any siege and any war. Their soldiers desert their posts when they see the dust kicked up by our hordes in the distance, their diplomats draft up conditional surrender documents before we even declare war, and their rulers beg one another for help against this neverending conquest.\n\nWe are truly the fear of Yanshen!"
 shuvuush.5.a:0 "Let them cower before us!"

 shuvuush.10.t:0 "Hekuudzoungh Festival"
 shuvuush.10.d:0 "(Old lore)Horse Race Tests. The Yomod Rüsh are on opposite migration patterns from the rest of us which means we only meet during the summer bonfires. Yearly migrations are interspered with longer five-year migrations where all the tribes congregate to compete against one another in tests of sport."
 shuvuush.10.b:0 "Our ruler shall participate"
 shuvuush.10.c:0 "Our heir shall participate"
 shuvuush.10.e:0 "We shall observe"

 shuvuush.13.t:0 "The Tsuista Khul Deal"
 shuvuush.13.d:0 "One of the more recent additions to the festival is the Hariigegh, where the rulers of every independent clan meet in a beautiful tent to eat great food and discuss matters of importance. [Y91.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Nuugdan Tsarai and [Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Tsuista Khul have been discussing the future of the Tsuista Khul clan for quite some time now. [Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has requested our support conquering greener pastures for them.\n\nThe people of Tsuista Khul wish for better grazing lands for their livestock, and wish to wage war for the city of Jincheng and all the fertile land that lays before it. Should we promise them support, we can expect significant military cooperation from them, as they not only ready their military but indeed their entire population. To cement the deal [Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] offers their close kins hand in marriage, should [Y91.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] desire it."
 shuvuush.13.a:0 "I accept both your child’s hand and your request for aid"
 shuvuush.13.b:0 "I accept your request for aid but must politely refuse the hand of your kin"

 shuvuush.100.t:0 "Life in the Steppes"

 shuvuush.101.a:0 "Don the black masks, ignite the jasmine! Tonight, we ride."

 shuvuush.102.t:0 "To Live On"
 shuvuush.102.d:0 "(Placeholder) A sorrowful story of a Shuvüüsh rider feeling satisfied at driving back the host of Facestealers, yet also depressed at the fact that they recognized one of the Facestealers as their father. They will need to forget him as soon as possible."
 shuvuush.102.a:0 "Come, Temul, tonight we celebrate the future of our [Root.GovernmentName]"

 shuvuush.103.t:0 "The Advice of the Present"
 shuvuush.103.d:0 "(Placeholder) This event maybe plays on the word "Xiong Nu" from Chinese? Not sure what the flavor is here."
 shuvuush.103.a:0 "Get an advisor from [Root.GetName]"
 
 shuvuush.997.t:0 "Facestealers Recede"
 shuvuush.997.d:0 "The tide of the Facestealer menace recedes before us, leaving in its wake ruin and tragedy. And yet, in the wreck--the faintest glimmer of hope."

 ### Modifiers
 spirit_farm_settlements:0 "Spirit-Farm Settlements"
 spirit_farm_settlements_desc:0 "The disparate, low-density population in Shuvüüshudi means that spirits tend to be sedentary, staying near landmarks and traditional grazing grounds. The most powerful spirits are nature spirits, gathering clusters of lesser spirits under their protection. Humans living in the lands pay these spirits tribute, hoping to win their favor and secure a blessing of grazing grounds. And so the humans roam, whereas the spirits cultivate."

 #Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_title:0 "Tsuista Khul Horde"
 #Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_desc:0 "Ever since the great Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun united the three major clans, diplomats have been trying to increase the cohesion of the clans. This has however proven difficult as the Shuvüüsh greatly value both freedom and tradition. Perhaps the upcoming Hekuudzoungh Festival planned for 1450 can bring forth some change."
 #Y91_jindeshi_valley_title:0 "Jincheng Valley"
 #Y91_jindeshi_valley_desc:0 "It is now time for us to secure a new land for our subjects, to let their livestock graze and their warriors raze. Let us conquer these lands and fulfil our promise."

 #Y91_integrating_the_tuiista_jaal_desc:0 "If we are to rule these lands with a firm grip, we must integrate our subjects into a single administration; no exceptions can be made, not even for our ancestral brethren.\n\nIt is time to convince the tribal elites to accept our demands for reform and buy them out."

 #Y91_freeing_ogre_subjects_desc:0 "For a long time, Tsuista Khul herders and farmers have tried to settle the harsh land of Aikogeoke, but they were always repelled by the Oni. \n\nNow that the Tsuista Khul are migrating southward, it is now up to us to try and gain land from the demons. Let us show our little brother how its done!"
 #Y91_start_oni_genocide_title:0 "First Oni Purge"
 #Y91_start_oni_genocide_desc:0 "The time has come to purge these horned monsters; to this end we should lay siege to their capital and destroy their seat of power.\n\n§ROur advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states, when the purge is completed. As such, they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"
 #Y91_clearing_the_demons_title:0 "Last Oni Purge"
 #Y91_clearing_the_demons_desc:0 "We must make sure that historians will not refer to the upcoming years as the second Oni purge, but rather as the last Oni purge - no Oni can remain in the hills when we are done.\n\n§ROur advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the Ogre side of the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states; as such they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"
 #Y91_prepare_seconds_title:0 "Prepare Seconds"
 #Y91_prepare_seconds_desc:0 "Yemàjinun and the fortress of Xuanbik have been described by clan leaders as vital acquisitions to the realm. No longer do the hilly lands and the forts bar our Terrorbird riders from conquering the Jiangyang - instead, they now fulfil a vital logistical role to aid it.\n\nSuch a delicious meal simply means we must go for seconds."

 #Y91_fields_for_the_fearless_desc:0 "The Shuvüüsh people bordering the lands of Jiantsiang have tried to let sneak their livestock into their fertile fields on more than one occasion. We should take these fields for our people, so that they may prosper."
 #Y91_along_the_coast_title:0 "Along The Coast"
 #Y91_along_the_coast_desc:0 "The path to the legendary city of Tianlou is one we must walk as a people. Only then will we truly flourish. To that end we should conquer along the lands of the coastal republics, where resistance is minimal and the lands are flat."

We will need war-shamans, foreign mages, Rünsukhi guides, and an infantry regiment to protect them in the unforgiving desert."
 #Y91_kill_facestealer_title:0 "Killing a Facestealer"
 #Y91_kill_facestealer_desc:0 "Killing the captured facestealer has proven harder than previously thought. It truly seems that Jaal was a god even in life, being able to slay one singlehandedly. Even a team of shamans and foreign mages have proven inadequate to slay the spirit.\n\nSome of the foreign mages speak of so-called Spirit Hunters, from Xianjie. We should seek them out, and borrow their expertise."
 #Y91_facestealer_killers_title:0 "A New Type Of Soldier"

 #Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Tolcuug hills"
 #Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_desc:0 "The people of Tolcuug and Bhalooxi look at the land west of them with envy. The Rünsukhi land we have cleansed of the vile Facestealers is becoming more liveable every week.\n\nThere are almost no Facestealers left there, and as a result there are less sandstorms and there is less death. The people of the Tolcuug hills now desperately wish for the same. We should prepare the armies."
 #Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Egoongaam"
 #Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_desc:0 "The Egoongaam clan of the most northern reach of our domain, separating us from the horsemen, has petitioned us to rid them of the Facestealers, like we did for their kinsmen."

 #Y91_clear_lakefolk_runsukhi_desc:0 "The lands of the Soolinúk are both the most fertile and the most plagued by the Facestealers. The Soolinúk clan claims to know where they come from, saying that the closer you get to the Baztaishaak Mountains, the more Facestealers you see, especially near the central mountain.\n\nThey beg us to rid them of their Facestealers and afterwards seek out a potential point of origin in the mountains."
 #Y91_into_the_mountain_title:0 "Into The Mountain"
 #Y91_into_the_mountain_desc:0 "It is time to amass our armies at the pass the Soolinúk clan mentioned, the one where the Facestealers go into and come out of, which we have had patrols cover ever since we cleansed the Khaashalg desert.\n\nThe Rünsukhi have set up a logistical network for our troops to be supplied when they are guarding the pass, even in great numbers. We have trained more Spirit Hunters, hired foreign mages, trained both our shamans and our men, and with a powerful mage [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to lead the expedition, morale will be higher than ever. We are ready - it is time to get our revenge."
 #Y91_lucky_scales_title:0 "A Blue Chance"
 #Y91_lucky_scales_desc:0 "The grand city of Jiangdu and its government once aided the Zhiqian in holding back our hordes, so with the fall of Xuanbik it was believed they would become our nemesis... \n\nNothing is less true; A rebellion of peasants has tore apart their realm and their military has suffered losses to a point where they cannot hope to reclaim stability without aid.\n\nTo them this is a disaster, to us, it is an opportunity. The self-declared peasant republic of Lanjinhui feigns strength and stability, but its institutions are weak, and its allies few. The only protection they have are their pitchforks and their unrulyness. If we are to either strike a deal with the old government in Jiangdu or make plans ourself, we can easily conquer this fertile farmland."
 #Y91_jiangdu_reborn_title:0 "Jiangdu Reborn"
 #Y91_jiangdu_reborn_desc:0 "One way or the other, we have done what had to be done to gain control over the region that once belonged to Jiangdu. Now is the time to set up a local government and look further inward."

 #Y91_nostalgic_fields_desc:0 "In our attempt to cut through the Yansheni and reach Feiten from two sides we have come across a strangely familiar sight. Endless fields of sands and shrubbery, but these fields are uncannily salty.\n\nIndeed, a lake devoid of all water lies before us. Our troops are wel-trained to fight in lands this flat, so the western approach to Feiten will soon be open!"
 #Y91_the_flanking_title:0 "The Flanking"
 #Y91_the_flanking_desc:0 "With the conquest of the drained lake of Hongnguan and the subjugation of Tianlou behind us, we can threaten Feiten from two sides and cut the Yansheni world in half."

It is time to reconquer these lands for our people and exploit its riches.\n\nLet us infiltrate their garrisons and collect information on their military. Once this is done we can crush them, together with the followers of Oedek - only this time they will never successfully rebel!"
 #Y91_peace_treaty_title:0 "Peace Treaty"
 #Y91_peace_treaty_desc:0 "The state of Danggun has been beaten back and is willing to engage in a treaty of conditional surrender; it is time to take the hilly lands of the giteuni for ourselves and give the fields of Jangaram to our brothers, as agreed."

 #Y91_at_the_jiangdu_gate_desc:0 "If we were to control either the fields of Ciying or those of Dacha, no river would stand between us and Jiangdu. With only a gate and a few thousand weak Yansheni stopping us, we will take the spoils of the city with ease."
 #Y91_integrating_jiangdu_title:0 "Integrating Jiangdu"
 #Y91_integrating_jiangdu_desc:0 "The city of Jiangdu has eluded us for a few years, but now it is firmly within our grasp. As we conquer cultural hub after cultural hub, it is becoming evident that we are indeed the third conquerors of these lands. Only we don't plan to crumble."

 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.4.d:0 "With the reconquest of Gowon, ancient scriptures about a long forgotten god named Bhengudak have been unearthed from libraries all over the land. These documents speak of a god that used to watch over the previous iteration of Guwaamud for over 800 years, the god being the old former ruler of Guwaamud, ascended. This god has long been viewed as either dead or dormant.\n\nWith the recent departure of our previous ruler however, this is no longer the case. Shamans across the lands have reported that they can now commune with a new being, one which identifies itself as Bhengudakhnar, which means Bhengudak and child. It seems as if the two Shuvüüsh rulers that both have formed Guwaamud, both in the past and in the present, have now merged into a single living deity.\n\nAs shamans receive visions of their messages, a new mask has been carved to represent him. Both rulers were famous in life for subjugating those of other faiths and conquering with impunity; as such, those of us who would rather spread the faith by the terrorbird than the mouth are beginning to claim him as their guiding deity.\n\n§R Bhengudakhnar is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his temple in Bhengutai.§!"

They say that the dry summers of the past few years have forced them to seek help. The rivers ran dry and they were forced to venture further from the homes to find food, losing many clansmen to the face stealing spirits in the process.

The locals claim he watches over them and they have erected a large circular wooden shrine around his final resting place, where he died of old age after uniting his homeland and negotiating a peace between the spirits and the humans on the isle.\n\nIt wasn't long before some of our officials on the isle had their own personal shrines of him in their houses and soon after our shamans sent a delegation to try and communicate with him. They came back claiming he is a strong ascended spirit, worthy of veneration as he has the wisdom to unite both spirits and humans.

Some our own, some belonging to the Rünsukhi, and others mages from Yanshen, hired with bags of crowns.\n\nThey all have two things in common: they are all wearing masks and they are all filled with fear, whether they show it or not. After a few minutes the first duststorm appears, a small whirlwind drawing near the regiment in the front. When the dust settles, a Facestealer is seen attempting to pull off the masks of some men, as others pelt it with projectiles and spells. Soon the spirit crumbles to sand, becoming one with the desert and the regiment continues to move forward, sustaining minor casualties.\n\nThe army walks for a whole hour without anything happening, when suddenly a sandstorm grows in the distance, nearing fast. As it draws closer, it gets bigger and bigger, as smaller whirlwinds join together. Some men ready their weapons, others adjust their masks. A shaman tries to calm his terrorbird, a mage turns around and starts running... [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a deep breath and prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very soul."

An hour later the last wounded man was on a cart home and the army pushed onward to the mountain, adamant to end this scourge once and for all.\n\nThe army approached the mountain and fought a few Facestealers here and there, emboldened by their previous victory, and it soon became clear they were protecting a cave entrance. [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] made [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way inside, with their most experienced combatants in tow, a mage lighting the way with an illuminating spell and a full regiment behind her.\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking and dealing with a couple of Facestealers who shrieked at the group when they charged, like mothers defending their babies, the cave walls became home to a disturbing feature. Actual human faces were embedded into the wall, made from flesh and stuck in a permanent expression of pain and panic. As the party went further down into the cave, the density of these faces on the walls, ceiling and floor increased, until the faces were so plentiful the shamans had to discuss if continuing to trample on our ancestors was sacrilege or permitted.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour of walking over the faces of their dead kinsmen the cave finally widened into a final room, its walls completely filled with faces. In the center of the room were hundreds of small, almost childlike Facestealers, who gave little resistance to spirit hunters. It was finally over - the home of the Facestealers was now under human control. The Shamans agreed that the cave will be taken care of by them, to ensure no sacrilege is committed against the faces of our, or anyone's, ancestors. The army returned home victorious, but will anyone ever be the same?"

 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.47.d:0 "As a Facestealer larger than any other ever seen tears the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] apart and rips off their face, a wave of fear spreads through the army. Men drop their fighting stance and run, riders are thrown from their birds and horses, formations break, shamans break down into prayer, and mages begin to teleport out. A spirit hunter hopelessly tries to hold the beast back, losing her head in the process.\n\nThe generals eventually manage to regain control of the army, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is already lost, and so is the day. Without purpose, the generals decide to return home, letting the Facestealers feast on the corpses - hopefully all the new faces will satiate them for generations to come."
