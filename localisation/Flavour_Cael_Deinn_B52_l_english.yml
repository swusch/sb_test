 cael_deinn.1.t:0 "The Grey Grimoire"
 cael_deinn.1.d:0 "Arabeth had always known that forging an elfrealm for her people was a far greater task than Daemir made it out to be. She didn’t fault him for raising unrealistic expectations, of course. The mage knew full well that believing the task was achievable was key in actually achieving it.\n\nThat’s why she ventured out as she did. Distantly, she was aware that the odds of finding any magical artifacts or weapons worth this effort was beyond unlikely. Between the orcs, other adventurers, and just the general destruction in the wake of the Greentide, Chivalric Escann’s treasures were largely lost, despoiled or taken. But, she still believed.\n\nIt was that belief that brought her once more to the ruined capital of a lost human realm called Acengard. Rumors had swirled that its perished rulers once tapped into powers beyond most mortal reckoning. While most such rumors were mere hearsay, there was always the chance of a speck of truth being behind them. And, it only took one speck to form a pearl.\n\nDeep below a fallen mage tower’s cellar, behind an illusory wall and guarded by an annoying number of mephits, Arabeth found her pearl - a grimoire, grey and non-descript, carrying a faint smell of sulphur.\n\nWith giddy excitement, she began flipping through it. The air cackled with arcane energy as the pages flew by. While some annotations had been scribbled in Common, the mage found the grimoire itself was written in a language she had never before seen. It was a harsh script, yet there was an almost cruel elegance to it.\n\nWith a triumphant grin, she stowed away her find. In time, she would surely decipher its secrets."
 cael_deinn.1.a:0 "And, in time, it would give her all that her heart desired."
 cael_deinn.2.t:0 "The Bloodpact"
 cael_deinn.2.d:0 "“The old Castanites believed there were seven sins. Pride. Envy. Sloth. Wrath. Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Corresponding to each was a being of unbelievable evil - traitorous gods who had risen against the Gods’ rightful ruler, Castellos.\n\nCast down and trapped in the underworld, these fallen beings whispered to the ears of unwitting mortals. They promised power in exchange for taking up their dark cause. And so the Infernal Court was born…\n\nHah, what ludicrous drivel!\n\nOh, the stories the creatures of Halann spin. Seven sins? Rebellions and fallen gods? The underworld? Such fanciful fantasies.\n\nAh, but I shouldn’t entirely dismiss such tall tales. There is some truth to them. We do tend to whisper sweet promises. How could we not? Desire rules the heart. It is simply a matter of time before the heart kneels before it.\n\nAnd in turn, all hearts will kneel before me. For I, Iabhal, am all you crave and more.”"
 cael_deinn.2.a:0 "They knelt, and thus so the pact was made."
 cael_deinn.2.a.tt:0 "§ROh, I know how deeply you desire a mission tree. Do not worry, creature, in time I shall fill you desires...§!"
 cael_deinn.2.b:0 "They stood, hearts filled with defiance."
 cael_deinn.2.b.tt:0 "§RAh, so it thinks it can avoid fate. That it can rise above the squalor of want. So be it, but know this is a fleeting victory...§!"
