 xia_summit.1.d:0 "Over a thousand years ago, in a time of great turmoil in Haless, venerated First Master Kai Jiàn of Jiangliusi summoned all the masters of the Accretive Path to a convention in the shadow of the Xiadao, where the disparate representatives of the various schools and paths forged bonds which would eventually be codified as the Xia itself. It is once again time to honor the most ancient tradition of the Xia."
 xia_summit.1.a:0 "Summon the Xiaken!"
 xia_summit.1.b:0 "We don't have time for such trivial matters."
 xia_summit.1.c:0 "Summon the Masters!"
 xia_summit.2.t:0 "The Question of the Righteous Summit"
 xia_summit.2.d:0 "The unification of the Xia and its subsequent territorial expansion have strained our bureaucracy to the point that relations between the Schools are showing signs of discord.

 xia_summit.2.a:0 "We must reform this venerable institution."
 xia_summit.2.b:0 "There is no longer any need for such a nuisance of a process."

It is once again time to honor the most ancient tradition of the Xia."
 xia_summit.3.a:0 "Send out some masters to vouchsafe the journeys of the Righteous Masters."

 xia_summit.11.t:0 "[xia_duel_instigator.GetName] Demands a Duel!"
 xia_summit.11.d:0 "It seems our delegation to the Righteous Summit has stepped on [xia_duel_instigator.GetName]'s toes. One of their masters has demanded to duel the offending master for the sake of their honor."

 xia_summit.11.b:0 "Accept the duel."
 xia_summit.12.t:0 "[xia_duel_target.GetName] Apologizes"
 xia_summit.12.d:0 "The offending Master from [xia_duel_target.GetName] has dodged our demands for a duel and apologized profusely to our delegation."
 xia_summit.12.a:0 "Cowards."
 xia_summit.13.t:0 "Xiaken Request Permission for Righteous Combat"
 xia_summit.13.d:0 "It seems tensions between two of the Xiaken have flared, and now they have agreed to a duel. It is up to us as the Wulin to decide whether or not this duel shall be allowed to take place during the Righteous Summit."

 xia_summit.13.b:0 "Forbid this nonsense. Now is not the time for fruitless internecine squabbles."
 xia_summit.14.t:0 "Duel Allowed"

 xia_summit.17.d:0 "The day of the duel has arrived, and all of the attending Xiaken gather in the assembly hall of the Jiangliubao to watch the two masters fight. It takes four rounds of brutal hand-to-hand combat with the occasional limited invocation of magic, but in the end, one of the masters stands tall above the other."

 xia_summit.17.b:0 "An inspiring display!"

 xia_summit.30.t:0 "Master Offers Service"
 xia_summit.30.d:0 "After today's morning assembly of the Xiaken, one of the independent masters in attendance approached $MONARCH$ and offered their service as an advisor."
 xia_summit.30.a:0 "The Wulin accepts this gracious offer."
 xia_summit.30.b:0 "We have no need of them."
 xia_summit.31.t:0 "Skilled Master Demands Advisory Position"
 xia_summit.31.d:0 "Following the end of the weekly Summit proceedings, an independent master known to be a quite capable practitioner of their tradition approached $MONARCH$ boasting mightily about their achievements and demanding to be appointed to the court as the representative of their school."
 xia_summit.31.a:0 "The Xia will make good use of you."
 xia_summit.31.b:0 "Our court is already full."
 xia_summit.32.t:0 "Wandering Warrior"
 xia_summit.32.da:0 "An enigmatic wandering warrior, seemingly impressed by $MONARCH$'s righteous personality, has approached us and offered their humble service. "
 xia_summit.32.db:0 "Multiple spies keeping watch over the Xiadao during the Righteous Summit have reported that a wandering warrior is passing through local taverns, inquiring about the personality of $MONARCH$, and whether there are any open positions in their court. He seems to be a uniquely skilled combatant."
 xia_summit.32.dc:0 "Following a long public debate held in the shadow of the Xiadao, a wandering warrior in attendance approached our delegation. After complimenting their righteous virtue he offered his service as a hero."
 xia_summit.32.a:0 "He shall lead our troops!"

 xia_summit.34.t:0 "Brawl Erupts during Humble Deliberation"
 xia_summit.34.da:0 "Our delegation to the Righteous Summit has sent word that, during a session of Humble Deliberation, a brawl erupted. They neglect to disclose whether or not they participated."
 xia_summit.34.db:0 "Today's session of Humble Deliberation began poorly and ended even worse. Multiple Xiaken were late, and halfway through, a monk from Shanyutian implied the monks of Fengzhaobu were uncivilized brutes. From there, the discussion degenerated into insults, and soon enough the delegations were at each other's throats."
 xia_summit.34.dc:0 "The Righteous Conclave is a hallowed institution, but today its reputation has been stained. A vicious brawl broke out between two particularly bellicose representatives."
 xia_summit.34.a:0 "Belligerent fools!"
 xia_summit.34.b:0 "What's going on over there?"
