 A31_state_visit_to_ibevar_desc:0 "Ibevar and Moonhaven have never been on good terms, a state of affairs that can be traced back almost entirely to ideological differences. The founder of Moonhaven, Varilor Bluetongue, promoted the idea of cannorisation of Moon Elves and their integration into human society. Meanwhile, Ibenion I. - the founder of Ibevar - sought to establish a purely elven realm in Cannor. After some consideration, Varion 'The Young' has decided to arrange a meeting with the Ibevari nobility, officially intending to 'bring forth the age of peace among moon elves.' There exists, however, a personal motive for this meeting as well, as Varion's uncle currently resides in Ibevar..."

Our fellow elves of Anbenncóst have shared in the suffering of their compatriots, and it is our duty as the elven elector to support them and provide relief. We should organise a state visit to Anbenncóst and provide aid in any way we can, up to inviting those who suffered grievously in the war to settle in Port Munas. The two cities share many similarities and the transition into a new life with us should be fairly painless."

 A31_the_lesser_anbenncost_desc:0 "Port Munas has always been considered a smaller sibling city to Anbenncóst, with the inhabitants of both cities being very similar in outlook and customs. Our recent diplomatic mission to the imperial capital saw a vibrant city  full of life, inhabited by people stemming from all races found within the empire. We should aim to turn Port Munas into a reflection of its more famous sister city in this aspect as well by inviting the other races of Anbennar to settle here. Let Moonhaven have its own little Anbenncóst."

 A31_true_to_the_regent_court_desc:0 "The debate is over and one thing has become clear - this Corinite heresy cannot be tolerated and will not find support in Moonhaven. Munas ascended to the court led by Castellos, and it would be inconceivable for him to not support the rightful heir, Castellos’ son Adean. And so must we, the Moon Elves, follow our founder. Unfortunately, some heretics are already present within our borders and we will have to deal with them first to safeguard our religious peace."

Luckily, there are plenty of other faithful countries in the empire who stand with Adean and defy Corin and her rabid mob of followers. Just as our ancestors on the Migrant Fleet joined forces with the valiant members of the League of Free Realms to fight Nichmer the Sorcerer-King, so must we unite the empire in order to safeguard it from the Corinites."

 A31_saving_the_misguided_desc:0 "To our north lie the lands of Istralore, our former ally and fellow supporter of House Silmuna and the Grand Duchy of Dameria. Alas, their lands are now overrun with Corinites, their soldiers praising the name of the celestial usurper. Our hearts are filled with sorrow for our misguided human comrades who were led astray by the deceitful lies of the Corinites. But their grave error in judgement will soon be corrected. We shall call upon our rangers and our allies and liberate Istralore from itself, returning it to the fold of the true Regent Court. They may well resist, but we know what is best for them."

 A31_liberating_our_brethren_title:0 "Liberating Our Brethren"
 A31_liberating_our_brethren_desc:0 "With Istralore under our protection and our northern flank firmly secured, we may now look at the rest of the empire. Both the Lilac Wars and the spread of the Corinite heresy have amply demonstrated the weakness of the empire and how shaky the protection offered by Anbennar to the elven people truly is. Moonhaven used to rely on others to protect the elves outside of our Silverwoods, first Dameria and then Istralore. We lost Dameria and barely managed to bring Istralore back into the fold. This cannot stand. We will have to take action ourselves and exercise direct control over elven lands in the empire if we are to fulfill our duty to ensure the security and freedom of all moon elves."

Many of the fools that joined the Corinites have abandoned that vile heresy and those who did not shall reap the deserved consequences of their intransigence. Our realm is secure from within, and the time has come to look outwards and deal with all external threats. The Corinite heresy is still an existential threat to the unity of the empire, and Moonhaven shall do its part in striking this evil down."

 A31_elves_within_the_empire_desc:0 "Our efforts to secure the safety and stability of the Empire of Anbennar have been a tremendous success. The faithful of the Empire bow down to Adean and the Corinites are now in retreat. All of this was only possible due to our help. The new emperor wisely acknowledged the part our elven rangers played in securing their position and the defeat of the Corinites, and accepted our proposal of expanding elven towns across the empire. The empire is strong and the moon elves have proven to be its loyal servants, greatly increasing our influence across Cannor. A time of peace and prosperity for all moon elves is at hand. Our people are safe and will remain this way for as long as both Moonhaven and the Empire stand tall."

 A31_a_new_path_desc:0 "After many contentious debates we have decided that Moonhaven stands with Istralore and Corin! Munas would most certainly support Corin's cause. He who arrived in Cannor with our people after the long years of the Great Wander, only to take up arms and lead the fight against evil without hesitation, just as Corin did according to her devoted followers. Together with our human allies we shall spread Her word throughout the empire, to both humans and elves alike."

Her legacy as a legendary warrior still persists in the hearts of Istralorian soldiers, renowned all across the Empire for their skills in warfare. While our own elven troops are mighty warriors as well, we could still learn something from our human cousins.

Now, its eastern part is split into Moonhaven and Istralore, an elven dominated and a human dominated realm. This divide affects our ability to work together seamlessly as a single union and should be mitigated as soon as possible. A proposal was made by some of our advisors to encourage a population exchange with Istralore, binding the peoples of our sister realms ever closer together."

But resting on our laurels is not in our nature, as we strive to improve even further. While Istralore’s focus remains on spreading its influence via war in the name of Corin, Moonhaven shall focus on developing the lands of East Dameria, nurturing the seeds of prosperity into a marvellous bloom. By strengthening our heartlands it will become much easier to acquire the resources needed to support both our own military endeavours as well as those of our Istralorian allies."

 A31_form_the_order_of_the_lamp_desc:0 "There are many truly devout elves living in Moonhaven, where both Munas and the Dame are widely worshipped, as is only to be expected given their history with elves and Moonhaven in particular. The ongoing religious conflicts have led some amongst our council to suggest we put our most devoted zealots to good use by sending them to help Istralore on the frontlines. With critics of the proposal unable to provide an alternate source of much needed manpower, and the devout themselves eager to defend their faith in battle, Moonhaven has decided to form the Order of the Lamp, whose members will be the shining light guiding the Corinites in these dark times."

Both elves and humans alike now accept Her claim as the true successor to Castellos, discarding the weak and craven Adean. With our ally seated on the imperial throne Moonhaven has risen in prominence across Anbennar. Thanks to our tireless efforts and devotion, the empire is strong and secure for elves and humans alike."

 A31_greater_revelation_title:0 "Greater Revelation"
 A31_greater_revelation_desc:0 "Many years have passed since the religious upheavals surrounding the mural of Castellos washed over Moonhaven. Many things have changed both in Moonhaven and elsewhere and more grand revelations have been made. Our beliefs are not the destination as we once believed, but rather a mere stopover before the truth of Ravelianism. Our ancestors have committed a heinous crime of theft, and wronged all other races of Halanna. The Precursors cannot be forgiven for this. But we can. Moonhaven shall lead the elves as it did before, but not in the name of Corin, who we once thought a Goddess rather than a saint, or Adean, who we once thought of as more than a mere aspect of a greater divinity, but in the name of redemption. The redemption for all elvenkind. The redemption for our ancient sins. All elves across Anbennar shall join us and help all other races uncover more secrets of the world. We owe them this much at least."

Moonhaven has been the diplomatic and mercantile heart of the imperial elves, and gained much influence in other circles as well. Now it is time to use that influence to spread the truth. In this way we shall gain the favor of the church leaders and the support of other imperial princes and urban magnates open to the teachings of Ravelianism, as our teahouses become places for the astute to ponder new revelations from the Almighty. No longer will rumination on the divine be confined to ancient temples or hidden shrines, now faith has become a matter for the merchant, the academic and even more so for the artificer."

In the years since it has become a key institution of higher education, contributing to both the archives at Konwell and the Moonmount Library and accessing their records in turn. In recent decades it has solidified its position as our preeminent center for academia, with many of the Ravelian scholars in our nation having first encountered the faith as students in its hallowed halls. Now with more knowledge and resources flowing back from our ancient homeland than ever before, the Riverglade academy must receive the funds required to establish more universities across our realm. Many of the Ravelian students of the academy will return as professors to teach the natural sciences, geography, history, theology and most important of all, artificery."

 A31_industrialize_artificery_desc:0 "While we have started to develop our own native crop of students, unless we provide suitable opportunities for them, we risk them working elsewhere at institutes with less prestige but more access to the most up to date discoveries. Fortunately, one of the Riverglade lecturers on economic theory has started a discussion group that has brought in many students of engineering, mathematics, sociology and artificery. They have drafted ambitious plans for large scale economic reforms to increase our access to precursor relics and our manufacturing capacity as well as modernize production sites that have for far too long been solely focussed on artisanal hand crafted goods.\n\nFurthermore, the plans promise to not only grow the economy, but to draw in expert workers and new scientific innovations from across the empire, thus ensuring that from now on we will always be in a position to keep up with the younger races."

 A31_the_school_of_thoughts_desc:0 "It has long been true that educated elves were more likely to find electoral success, but historically the most prestigious education has been considered to be rhetoric and legal or political studies, with an understanding of economics considered acceptable but not required. Now though, since most of the electorate has become familiar with and dependent on artificery that is no longer enough.\n\nNow ambitious young elves spend less time at galas and more in university libraries, as the new electorate demands representatives who are educated in the modern sciences. They move to dissect rhetoric and economics with the same keen gaze they have previously applied to arcana and theology and have massively advanced the domain of political science. As elves we are able to master many fields of study during our lifespans, and thus, while our human neighbors may need to settle for leaders literate in but a few areas, our best are able to spend centuries undergoing rigorous study and research, enabling them to bring their erudition to the highest civil and administrative positions in our Elfrealm republic."

Founded in the aftermath of the Interregnum, it was meant to provide the many different peoples from across the continent a way to resolve their differences peacefully, eliminate unnecessary conflict and channel magic without war and death sweeping over the lands of the Empire. For too long, petty infighting and religious conflicts have prevented it from living up to these ideals, instead restricting magical power to an entrenched elite who in their arrogance dared deny the true nature of the world around them and the heavens above. \n\nAt last we have an opportunity to end this, to bring Ravelianism into the highest halls of the empire. Share its gifts of insight and invention, turn the magical nobles who hoarded the divine gift of magic into faithful servants of the people and empower artificery as the new bedrock of imperial might. This divine insight will at long last allow the empire to live up to the ideals it was founded on. Community and Unity for all under the one true God."

While the tea trade kept us rich, its profits did not keep up with the increased demands on our budget.\n\nRecently however stories from daring explorers and traders have reached us about the Vyzemby halflings living on an island chain off the southern coast of Sarhal. Their homeland appears to be uniquely suitable for the cultivation of a variety of exotic spices, cloves most prominent among them, previously unknown in Cannor. Controlling the trade with these spices could empower our merchants for decades, and pave our way into the hallowed halls of power out of sheer desire for this exclusive new gustatory experience."

Secondly, the local Baashidi seem to have some strange advantage in these waters, and appear to be able to avoid underwater hazards in a way even our canniest captains cannot match or explain. \n\nHowever, recent news could promise to change that. The crew of the Starguide, a large merchant ship, have just returned to Moonhaven on another vessel after being forced to beach their ship on what the locals call the Tajalme Plains.

The local merchants claim it sharpens the mind, and awakens the soul, preparing the mind for study or philosophy. Frankly, if this is all they drink beforehand we understand why they have failed to extend their reach beyond their small corner of the world. This so-called coffee is vile, a truly miserable drink unfit for the refined elven palate. \n\nIt is our duty to stop this outrageous lapse in taste. While the efforts might be great we must find or crossbreed some variety of tea that grows readily in these Sarhaly soils to provide the locals with a more fitting alternative.

 A31_lands_in_the_south_desc:0 "Aelantir is vast and ripe for the taking, and we are spoiled for choices when it comes to the question of where to focus our attention first. Our explorers have noted that the southern half of Aelantir, in particular the region which human colonists call the Lai Peninsula, is a region with an agreeable climate well-suited for the establishment of both elven settlements and plantations. However, the mainland parts of the continent are filled with our long lost cousins who appear less than overjoyed with our arrival. One officer of our expeditionary forces named Ivrandir has suggested sending out some of our troops into the inner parts of that region. Ivrandir is said to be a harsh leader with a clear dislike of the Ruinborn elves, but with a great sense of duty to Moonhaven. Perhaps we should let him lead the proposed expedition?"

 A31_the_first_home_of_tea_desc:0 "We believe to have found the origin of the tea samples brought by our ancestors on the Migrant Fleet to Cannor! The plantations in our southern colonies have shown excellent growth, surpassing any harvest ever achieved back in Cannor. And the local soil has imbued these tea leaves with a unique flavour that is uncannily similar to the descriptions found in the earliest remaining records regarding tea cultivation. This discovery is truly groundbreaking and we shall use this knowledge to our advantage and start expanding our colonial plantations massively. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of a global elven tea trade?"

This is a rare opportunity for us to study the civilization of our ancestors and uncover some of their lost secrets. Our best mages are most eager to gain access to the relics, promising to reveal any Precursor secrets they can get their hands on. Maybe answers to some of the many questions left unanswered for many centuries will finally be revealed to us."

 A31_exemplary_elven_navy_desc:0 "Prior to its arrival in Cannor the Migrant Fleet spent a thousand years lost at sea. Several elven generations have been born and raised entirely at sea, taming it and sharing their knowledge with later generations. Since then, the presence of elves on the seas has diminished significantly, with the exclusion of the elusive Sea Elves. But no more. If our global empire is to grow and prosper, it requires a constant and powerful presence at sea. Our shipyards must be renovated, our fleet must be expanded and our sailors, from lowly deck hand to admiral must truly master their calling! With the blessing of Munas the Navigator the wide seas will be mastered by elves once more."

Our ships are getting ready to sail, and soon Moonhaven will have a vast collection of precursor relics. Our colonies might take some offense at this heavy-handed approach, but they should know that the interests of Moonhaven proper outweigh the particular interests of its colonies."

 A31_the_second_origin_of_tea_desc:0 "The Humans of Yanshen dare to claim that their land is the true birthplace of tea instead of Aelantir. What a preposterous fancy! Yanshen may merely lay claim to being the first place the cultivation of tea spread to and it was indubitably our elven ancestors who first discovered the divine gift that is tea. Regardless, the tea grown in Yanshen is markedly different from our traditional blends and access to their exotic concoctions could greatly benefit our growing tea hegemony. We shall secure control over the local plantations and expand them by replacing the outdated human ways of growing it with the objectively more efficient elven ones."

 A31_creating_rial_thae_title:0 "Creating Rial Thae"
 A31_creating_rial_thae_desc:0 "Our intrepid explorers made a most peculiar discovery in Aelantir. They have found writings referring to a certain type of precursor tea called 'Rial Thae'. From what we managed to understand, this so-called ‘King Tea’ was a beverage reserved for precursor royalty and is said to 'improve one's essence', whatever that means. Unfortunately the secret of Rial Thae has been lost, but with our numerous global plantations we surely stand a chance of recreating it.\n\nThe funding of a research project to try and recreate it has found unanimous support in our government, but the question of who shall lead this project has divided public opinion. Our mages claim they are the obvious choice as the precursors were powerful mages and therefore the secret of Rial Thae surely can only be uncovered by magic. On the other hand, the artificers have shown their interest in this project and may have a point in claiming that the magic of the Precursors is long lost and that only their artificery can come close to recreating Rial Thae."

 A31_a_feast_in_the_redglades_desc:0 "Just a few short years ago the Lilac wars divided most of Anbennar into two factions - the Damerian Moon Party, which we proudly belonged to, and the Lorentish Rose Party. Thus we ended up on opposite sides of the conflict with our brethren from the Elfrealm of the Redglades, and even though peace has returned to the realm, we have not yet mended the strained relationship with our cousins to the west. Our ruler, Varion 'The Young', has therefore decided to personally attend to this matter and sent a message proposing to arrange a reconciliatory feast between our two peoples to be held in the Redglades. If they do accept the proposal, it will surely facilitate the healing of any lingering wounds caused by the decades of conflict."

 A31_remoteness_of_celmaldor_desc:0 "The northern Moon Elven republic of Celmaldor is perhaps the most peculiar of all elven realms. Despite breaking away from the rest of the Migrant Fleet led by Munas to create their own home far away from all their kin and refusing to join in the war against the Sorcerer-King, they still maintain an identity similar to ours. But all that is ancient history by now, we are all elves and thus can and shall work together. Our renewed contacts with Venáil have already improved our shipbuilding capabilities, now it is time to improve our ports as well. We just might persuade the Celmaldori to aid us in this endeavour and share some of the secrets that went into the construction of their famed White Harbour."

The coasts of Moonhaven are beautiful and pleasant, but unfortunately not ideal for the cultivation of tea. Vast stretches of Aelantir, on the other hand, appears to possess a climate far better suited for this task. As we make steady progress in establishing colonies in Aelantir, we should establish several tea plantations in suitable locations there."

This region is filled with warlords fighting over the meagre remains of Precursor civilization and their enslaved countrymen, worshipping illustrious or infamous warlords of the past as gods. This land, despite having fallen to barbarity, is of vital importance to us due to the number of precursor relics and local tea plantations found here, which will be better off under our benevolent rule. While the locals most certainly will not submit peacefully, we are by now more than familiar with the methods needed to subdue our recalcitrant distant cousins."

 A31_eordand_herbal_tea_title:0 "Eordan Herbal Tea"
 A31_eordand_herbal_tea_desc:0 "Our explorers have found yet another unusual region of Aelantir - Eordand. Local Ruinborn elves have allied themselves with the fey inhabiting the dense woodlands of the region to survive the Ruin and their descendants are thus generally much better off than most other Ruinborn we have encountered in Aelantir. Most interestingly and importantly to us, the locals have preserved our shared ancestral appreciation for tea. The city of Elchos is known to grow a particular type of herbal tea, said to contain the very aroma of the spring itself! We should get our hands on these samples and expand its production - this is a far too marvelous blend to allow its cultivation to remain limited to just one city."

 A31_reorganize_the_colonial_office_title:0 "Reorganize the Colonial Office"
 A31_reorganize_the_colonial_office_desc:0 "When younger races envision the nature of imperial growth, the humans picture a war camp, where knights and pikemen drill and train, ready to take new lands with fire and sword. The dwarves picture a mine, with picks and blasting powder piled high to carve more caverns and tunnels into the earth, leaving ugly gashes behind as they do so. Halflings picture the hammer and plow, turning any land into a breadbasket and constructing new hamlets surrounded by farms and orchards. For the gnomes, growth seems to be exemplified by dense urban development, with housing blocks and workshops densely intertwined, where they can fiddle with strange devices to their hearts’ content. \n\nInstead, our experts in the AIECOCA promote the growth of our realm with the ship, the ledger and the pen. Elves who have spent decades overseeing colonial efforts plan out each settlement with an unmatched degree of expertise. We study the local languages, map out the landscape and climate and identify promising local industries - all before a single elven life is risked on foreign soil. The benefits of such meticulous colonial planning are self-evident and we shall continue to improve our methods constantly."

Already our traders have begun to explore the opportunities found on these distant shores and our sailors report that the rumours were true and there are countless riches to be acquired in Haless - porcelain, all manner of spices and even tea! This is merely the first step, however, and we will establish a firm presence in Haless, either through diplomatic means or, if necessary, by conquest."

They all crave the tea supplied by Moonhaven. Our ancestral beverage of choice is consumed no longer just by the Damerian nobility. What once started as a few seeds inside a family locket, lovingly nurtured during the many years of the Great Wander and painstakingly cultivated in the foreign soil of Dameria, has grown into something marvellous. Our ships are sailing all across Halann with their cargo holds filled to the brim with tea, and bringing back the profit our tea hegemony has gained us back home."

 A31_first_steps_desc:0 "We have taken the first step and established our first colony in Aelantir. It may not yet look that impressive, but it represents an important milestone on our path to elven resettlement of our ancestral lands. While we do share the sentiment expressed by our other moon elven brethren that we have a responsibility to become caretakers of our ancestral homeland, we do not feel the need to subjugate or displace our distant cousins whose ancestors have remained in Aelantir, nor do we wish to abandon Cannor out of a misplaced sense of nostalgia. Our home is in Moonhaven and will remain there, our colonies merely exist to enrich our home, not to replace it."

Now the mantle has seemingly passed on to Varion, a fact he has not yet fully come to terms with yet. But today is the day he meets his uncle. Varion is uncertain, he is nervous. But it needs to be done. They need to talk it out. After all, they are one family, right? \n... \nSeveral hours later Varion finally emerged from the room. On his face - a smile, and inside of him - confidence. Varion is acutely aware of the precarious situation of his dynasty, but instead of dread it now fills him with desire. The desire to make it count. The desire to lead all Moon Elves as his grandfather once did."
 A31_flavour.21.a:0 "I will strive to honour our noble legacy, uncle."
 A31_flavour.22.t:0 "The House of Bluetongue"
 A31_flavour.22.d:0 "The House of Bluetongue is an influential elven dynasty, established by Varilor Cymlan, brother of Munas Moonsinger himself. The Bluetongues ruled Moonhaven for the majority of its existence and now, following the death of his father, Varion The Young has been elected as the new ruler of the Elfrealm. Unlike his predecessors who focused just on Moonhaven, secure under the protection of Dameria, Varion needed to look outwards. With Dameria gone Moonhaven now needs to protect itself, or find a new ally who will help it do so. The Moon Elves as a whole have shown to be very divided, with some even having fought each other during the Lilac Wars. Varion's uncle has fled to Ibevar following the Wexonard conquest of his former home of Varivar, and Varion has not been in contact with him since, thus still lacking the formal blessing of his uncle to lead House Bluetongue and the Moon Elves of the Empire as a whole. Varion has been contemplating the right course of action for months. But the time for thinking has passed. If Moonhaven is to survive and prosper along with its elven inhabitants it requires decisive action. And Varion must be the one to lead the way."
 A31_flavour.22.a:0 "For it is the duty of the Bluetongues to lead."
 A31_flavour.23.t:0 "The Greater Revelation"
 A31_flavour.23.d:0 "While none have ever doubted our devotion, we have always had a different relationship with divinity than most. The founders of our republic knew Munas as a mortal elf, albeit one of uncommon vision and skill. The philosophers and intellectuals that fill the tea and coffee houses of our nation have long since discussed this distinction, including many who held membership in the Ravelians. Now, these elves of distinction come forward with new and impressive arguments. They claim Munas the elf was but the chosen saint of the one true god, whose existence has since been rediscovered by our elven cousins in Aelantir.\n\nThis claim, divined from the Ravelian God Fragment, has swept through our cities swiftly, and the influential urbanites call on us to commit to this new faith, whatever it should mean for our future."
 A31_flavour.23.a:0 "Let us praise Saint Munas, Blessed of the one true God."
 A31_flavour.23.b:0 "I do not trust this strange relic, we shall worship as we did before."
 A31_flavour.24.t:0 "Baashidi Diplomats Approach Us"
 A31_flavour.24.d:0 "After her safe return to Moonhaven, the Captain of the Moonsinger has been eager to return to South Sarhal and she has taken a few prospective new settlers with her to meet with the local leaders who helped the crew during their time stranded there. Initial meetings are marked by uncertainty, as the Baashidi did not know we would be returning but after a few meetings they have sent some of their diplomats to speak with us. It seems they are open to working alongside us as partners, impressed by the goods of Cannor and Aelantir our ships have brought to their shores. They even share some enlightening details about the merfolk, their allies who dwell beneath the waves and who have a unique advantage in navigating those waters.\n\nHowever for all they offer us the fact remains that they are a strange folk, their merchants competing greedily with our growers and chartered companies and their religion is strange and deeply heathen. Though they in one breath acknowledge that Munas may have ascended to the heavens, they claim in the next that he must have made war against the Dame to do so. Can we ever trust such people?"
 A31_flavour.24.a:0 "As they seek to share their local knowledge we would be fools not to accept it."
 A31_flavour.24.b:0 "We cannot trust such strange folk to be reliable allies."
 A31_flavour.25.t:0 "Ravelianism in Moonhaven"
 A31_flavour.25.d:0 "News has arrived from the south, our long term allies in Moonhaven have formally announced their adoption of this strange new Ravelian faith, and this news has brought great discord to the court. While some think nothing of it, others shun the elves for their abandoning what was long held as the truth, and a few are moved to contemplate the merits of this new faith by this announcement. The elves have long been thought of as wise and patient folk and would not do such a thing without forethought. Perhaps we ought to reexamine some long held assumptions and take this chance to once again lead the empire in adopting this latest religious revelation."
 A31_flavour.25.a:0 "Let us praise Saint Corin, Blessed of the one true God."
 A31_flavour.25.b:0 "The Elves will do as they may, we know who leads in the heavens."
 A31_flavour.26.t:0 "The Light of Truth may shine over Moonhaven!"
 A31_flavour.26.d:0 "The artificers of our realm have approached us with a proposition. They have devised a novel form of governance inspired by records of the system of government practiced by the Gnomish Hierarchy of old, and designed to conduct the business of governance according to logical principles. Of course, artificers are bound to play an important role in this new ‘technocracy’, but they assure us that this is merely an unavoidable consequence of a government based on intellect and merit."
 A31_flavour.26.a:0 "We shall embrace the new ways."
 A31_flavour.26.b:0 "On second thought, the republic has worked well for us until now."
