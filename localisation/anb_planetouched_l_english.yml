 planetouched.101.t:0 "Planetouched Heir"
 planetouched.101.d:0 "It is difficult to hide when a child has powerful planetouched powers. If flowers bloom under every step they take, or the hair on their head is permanently aflame, then chances are the news will get out sooner or later. It's shocking that word of [Root.Heir.GetName]'s true power has not split out before now, but there is no point in hiding it any longer. The heir to the throne of [Root.GetName] is planetouched."
 planetouched.101.a:0 "A frightening power"

 planetouched.102.t:0 "Planetouched Heir"
 planetouched.102.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] stood out against any potential alternate candidate in part due to their powerful planetouched powers. They had kept the powers relatively hidden until recently, as planetouched were often feared and misunderstood across the history of Sarhal, but with their path to the throne secured, there is no longer any point in hiding that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is a planetouched."
 planetouched.102.a:0 "Interesting"

 planetouched.103.t:0 "Planetouched Commander"
 planetouched.103.d:0 "A promising new soldier has been making waves in the military, using their unique powerful planetouched powers to destroy their foes and command loyalty amongst their peers. Planetouched have historically made for excellent military leaders and we can count our blessings that this individual fell into our laps and not those of our enemies."
 planetouched.103.a:0 "Promote them to general at once"
 
 planetouched.104.t:0 "Planetouched ruler republic"
 planetouched.104.d:0 "This is a hidden event so this is just fluff, you can safely ignore it"
 planetouched.104.a:0 "Good Luck"

 planetouched.201.t:0 "Fire Breaks Out In The Courtroom"
 planetouched.201.d:0 "It starts with a skirmish, a guard holding back one of our littlefolk, trying to keep order. Peasants who think that just because they were given the right to see our glorious leader, that they have the right to speak with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. The scuffle stops and a corpse falls to the ground. Peasants push back, trying fruitlessly to fight off their oncoming deaths.\n\nWhen the tide of peasants finally explodes, men-at-arms are sent backwards into a pillar which rains down splinters of wood towards $MONARCH$’s throne. The splinters burst into flames, fed by $MONARCH$’s natural fire, leaping from rotted pillar to sagging ceilings. If it is not stopped, it may burn down the palace. The fire begins to sneak itself though our rotting castle gate, pushing into the cramped castle town, threatening to turn it to ash. What should we do?"
 planetouched.201.a:0 "Let it burn"
 planetouched.201.b:0 "Try to put it out"


 planetouched.202.t:0 "Inspiration In The Flames"
 planetouched.202.d:0 "Whilst inspecting one of our armies, $MONARCH$ realised that they train more diligently when observed by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] up close rather than from a distance. $MONARCH$ believes that this stems from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s obviously planetouched appearance - whether this is due to the soldiers deriving inspiration from the flames or by a fear of burning cannot be said. Whichever is the truth, $MONARCH$ could choose to use a display of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power to help our armies become better than our rivals. While doing this could be used to inspire or discipline our troops it would also be a constant demand for $MONARCH$’s time, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would have to make frequent trips to our army"
 planetouched.202.a:0 "Show them to the inspiration within fire"
 planetouched.202.b:0 "Show them how fire can hurt"
 planetouched.202.c:0 "Our army is fine as it is"

 planetouched.203.t:0 "$MONARCH$ Ignites A Forest Fire"
 planetouched.203.d:0 "Our ruler took a leisurely ride this morning, hoping to forget the day-to-day struggles of a ruler for a few short moments. Unfortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] accidentally brushed some dry leaves whilst getting down from their horse, causing a conflagration which has quickly consumed the forest around them! \n\nThe blaze has quickly grown so large that our ruler is unable to contain the fire by themselves. We could limit the destruction by using the small royal guard which came along to protect our $MONARCH_TITLE$; they could be used to dig up a perimeter to stop the flame from growing too large. However the blaze is currently surging towards an area of largely unsecured jungle; left to its own devices, we could build on top of what it leaves behind and create a new city, extending our nation's control over the isolated communities which currently dot the area."
 planetouched.203.a:0 "Use the new space to build a city"
 planetouched.203.b:0 "Try to limit the fire and let the plantlife regrow"

 planetouched.301.t:0 "Sandstorm Averted"
 planetouched.301.d:0 "Our glorious ruler has recently shown their compassion by stopping a sandstorm from devastating a rural hinterland. The reports coming in from the province state that after the sandstorm appeared on the horizon, it rapidly dissipated and no major winds have been seen; they anticipate a better harvest as a result. We could use this reported respite in the usually windblown landscape to scan for anything we could use in this untouched region, or we could use the window to establish a new trading hub, attracting more merchants from across the desolate wastes."
 planetouched.301.a:0 "Use the respite to exploit the area"
 planetouched.301.b:0 "Build a trading post"
 planetouched.301.c:0 "Build an outpost to increase our control over our domain"
 planetouched.301.e:0 "Build a city for us to return to"

 planetouched.302.t:0 "The Winds Of Trade"
 planetouched.302.d:0 "Strangely, some of our key ports have been reporting many more foreign visitors than usual, even during the off season. This supposedly comes from a wind which pulls towards our coast, even if this is good for the merchants. Our rivals believe that we are unfairly forcing trade away from their ports calling the winds ‘$COUNTRY_ADJ$ winds’ because our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] exploiting their wind planetouched affinity and not due to just being lucky.\n\nOur ruler’s demeanour has also seemingly changed, tending towards the mischievous – this only lends evidence to the unsubstantiated rumour. Some people in court are saying that if we do not stop them then it will reflect badly upon our nation, and instead we should try and build up new ports to attract trade naturally instead of resorting to these underhanded methods."
 planetouched.302.a:0 "Stop him and build more attractive trade ports"
 planetouched.302.b:0 "I mean it is good for business…"
 planetouched.302.c:0 "Stop them. Our finances are good as is"
 WPT_3_more_time_COT_upgrade_tt:0 "Up to 3 other Centres of Trade will be given §JTrade Power§! depending on their level"

 planetouched.401.t:0 "To Rule The Waves"
 planetouched.401.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has been practising and strengthening their planetouched abilities. Whilst doing this they have found a way to manipulate the waves underneath our ships to help our sailors achieve more without the need for extra rowing or waiting for wind.\n\nTwo clear uses for this newfound power have presented themselves: first, they can focus and help our armadas by showing their power to our people, helping increase sailor enlistment. However, the amount of power required to enhance a fleet the size of ours would be absurd even for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - we must play favourites. This might cause the unhelped side of the navy to become demotivated at the lack of enhancement."
 planetouched.401.a:0 "Use it to improve our Trade"
 planetouched.401.b:0 "Use it to improve our Armada"

 planetouched.402.t:0 "An Amphibious Unit"
 planetouched.402.d:0 "Our water-blessed ruler has been spending more and more time in lakes and springs around our capital, but other people who try to relax there have reported dangerous currents and large amounts of water being moved. These two events were hardly coincidental and we knew they must be related.\n\nAfter asking $MONARCH$ about these events they have told us that they have been planning to create a special marine regiment. Taking together the fact that only planetouched individuals can match our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with what our reports claim, it is only reasonable to presume that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is planning on creating a regiment of planetouched marines, brought together by the personal affinity they feel to our ruler."
 planetouched.402.a:0 "A professional unit could be useful"
 planetouched.402.b:0 "No this is too outlandish"

 planetouched.501.t:0 "Precious Metals"
 planetouched.501.d:0 "Our ruler, seeing the volatility of our coffers, has chosen to try and smooth the process to allow for more consistent growth regardless of if we choose to expand or instead undergo massive construction projects. They have chosen to do this by moving mined metals through underground mole-like-tunnels, protected from highwaymen and natural disasters. This has allowed production in mines to increase as they no longer have to waste resources on transporting the expensive goods and can instead focus all their efforts on just mining. Bumper profits have ensued, but what should we use these profits for?"
 planetouched.501.a:0 "Use the profits to improve the mines"
 planetouched.501.b:0 "Use the profit to build a strong trade centre"
 planetouched.501.b:0 "Keep the profit"

 planetouched.502.t:0 "Raise The Earth"
 planetouched.502.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has recently found themself fascinated by all things architectural. They have spent many free hours looking down upon our capital and requesting information on construction and buildings are doing – how it might be improved and how builders could be valuable in wartime as well. Their passion has slowly grown, and now shortcuts under internal castle walls and intricate sculptures have been spotted emerging apparently spontaneously around the castle, with the ‘culprit’ not being found. We could propose that our ruler could help the arduous task of building in our overcrowded capital. However, people only have so many hours in a day and a ruler even less… so towards which of their passions should we direct them?"
 planetouched.502.a:0 "Improve our fortifications"
 planetouched.502.b:0 "Aid with initial landscaping"
 planetouched.502.c:0 "This is unnecessary"

 planetouched.601.t:0 "Life Is Blooming"
 planetouched.601.d:0 "Our glorious ruler is blessed and with their ascension to our throne life has seemingly blossomed with them. All over our domain, trees bear more fruit, apples swell larger and livestock grow fatter and healthier – even the runts of the litter now look like prized cattle by normal standards.\n\nThis has done wonders for our exports, as traders and nobles in and outside our realm hear about our unique produce and all desire to sample it. As a result, the price of our cattle has grown tenfold and sometimes even more! However, as the cattle are a limited breed, a question has arisen: What should we choose to do with these so-called 'blessed cows'?"
 planetouched.601.a:0 "Seize all of these ‘Magical Animals’ and sell them!"
 planetouched.601.b:0 "Control the export of the animals"
 LPT_years_income_3_telling_tt:0 "Gain §G3 years§! worth of Trade Income."
 LPT_wool_livestock_less_explain_tt:0 "For 15 years all §YWool§! and §YLivestock§! provinces will gain: \n§R -33% Local Production Efficiency§! \n§R +2 Local Unrest§!\n"

 planetouched.602.t:0 "A Love Of Life"
 planetouched.602.d:0 "Recently criminals have not found the justice they deserve within our cities due to our ruler's gentle nature: not just petty thieves who steal because they need to scrape by, but leaders and members of criminal gangs whose indictments have made the toughest of our soldiers squirm to hear. We can barely sharpen our executioner's axe before our ruler steps in and stops us. In response, gangs have stopped targeting royal buildings as to not anger our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and risk ending this period of clemency. However the little folk who once believed in our kind-hearted ruler have now turned their backs. Some suggest we should deal with the criminals ourselves without a decree. Others say that we must remain loyal and trust $MONARCH$’s guidance."
 planetouched.602.a:0 "This policy might help relations with the underworld"
 planetouched.602.b:0 "We need to stop them!"

 planetouched.701.t:0 "Shadows Take The Consort"
 planetouched.701.d:0 "Our Monarch awoke today and found their consort dead. Their stone-cold lifeless body unmoving, still in the same position as $MONARCH$ remembers them being when they drifted to sleep. The life of a shadow planetouched is rarely a happy one, but their dear [Root.Consort.GetName] was one thing which did make their life worth living.\n\nThey want to die.\n\nThey know they can't though. They know that their love would want them to live, to laugh, to feel passion again. They can’t. They might have other wives but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows that they can’t. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows that they can do one thing to remember them. They can grow the nation into a stable powerhouse. Into a state that will last forever, one that won’t be relegated to the annals of history."
 planetouched.701.a:0 "Oh my dear Wife"
 planetouched.701.b:0 "Oh my dear Husband"

 planetouched.702.t:0 "One Final Gift"
 planetouched.702.d:0 "Despite $MONARCH$’s dearest husband departing in such sudden and tragic circumstances not even a year ago, he has given her one last gift, one last hope. A gift to try and warm her heart even though that might be impossible without his loving embrace. He left her a baby. The young one has been delivered without complication and sits in $MONARCH$’s arms, sleeping quite peacefully."
 planetouched.702.a:0 "One final thing to remember him by…"
 planetouched.702.b:0 "They will be a good spare"

 planetouched.703.t:0 "Shadows Come To Life"
 planetouched.703.d:0 "Whilst practising their magic, $MONARCH$ has realised that they can hear and sometimes see through the shadows of their courtiers and sometimes even random citizens in the capital city. Realising that this could be a valuable resource in keeping order within the realm or it could help us to expand our influence as none of our enemies would expect their shadows to peer into their lives.\n\nWe could put the shadows to work within the realm; each Temple housing a divine shadow cast over their holy place, each noble kept under subtle surveillance and will never be alone even if they think they are. We could also send the shadows abroad to spy for us. After all, who expects their shadow to spy on them? This would allow for the greatest flow of knowledge to come into our nation."
 planetouched.703.a:0 "Our estates are the biggest issue"
 planetouched.703.b:0 "Softly and gently they will spy on our rivals"
 planetouched.703.c:0 "Only use them as jovial entertainment for guests"
