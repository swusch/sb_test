 flavor_magisterium.1.d:0 "After several years of preparation, we have concentrated enough resources of the nation to mount a large-scale expedition.

 flavor_magisterium.2.t:0 "Diverging Opinions"
 flavor_magisterium.2.d:0 "With the logistics of the operation put in place, two divergent opinions appeared among the leaders of the expedition.

 flavor_magisterium.3.d:0 "What first looked like a large stone rising to the sky was actually an obelisk of unknown material, marking the location of a partially flooded underpass.

 flavor_magisterium.5.t:0 "Swamp of Sorrows"
 flavor_magisterium.5.d:0 "Within the marsh itself, there are a myriad of stinky charms, punctuated in the peat that appears as the area is emptied of any form of moisture. The permanent relay of various teams of mages and mowers finally revealed an entire part of the sunken city. Although most of these buildings are unusable or worthless, one of them, strangely well preserved, caught the attention of the expedition, which is now directing all its efforts towards this strange building."
 flavor_magisterium.5.a:0 "Onward!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.6.t:0 "Laboratory"
 flavor_magisterium.6.d:0 "We quickly pierced the entrance of this strange, temple-seeming building, and disabled its magic golems. It has turned out to actually be a laboratory, filled with all kinds of curiosities dating from an age well older than anyone here present. With this discovery, the expedition finally comes to an end, allowing the Magisterium to access a whole lot of new knowledge and relics. At first glance, our leading historians suggest that the precursors may have been experimenting on the native Halanni humans?!"

 flavor_magisterium.7.d:0 "Shattering the skies upon its arrival, a titanic sphere, coated with fire and flames tinged with a pearly blue, crosses the sky at full speed, crashing perpendicularly to the center of the altar created for the ritual. The blast of the explosion destroyed all the preemptive barriers set up, shaving plains and hills, tearing jungle and forest, vitrifying the sand, liquefying the rock. But no matter the means employed, the result is there: The largest Damestear deposit on the planet. Radiant with a twilight glow, and defying the beauty of the most beautiful women in Halann."

The strategic position, the economic value, and the cultural heritage of this city do not allow it to remain without a master powerful enough to guarantee its independence. As undisputed leader of the Damesear, it is our duty to present to the Emperor our candidacy as guardian of the city of cities."

 flavor_magisterium.19.d:0 "These crazy Anbenncósters have lost their reason, decadent in their liberal ideals, and have refused our generous offer!"
 flavor_magisterium.19.a:0 "Where's the nearest War Wizard?!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.20.t:0 "Gems Excavated"
 flavor_magisterium.20.d:0 "Our wizards were right, and under the Moonmount there was indeed a huge amount of precious stones. Although their purity is not the best, it remains sufficient to ensure income and materials for our projects."
 flavor_magisterium.20.a:0 "Mine them all!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.21.t:0 "Corinite Debate"
 flavor_magisterium.21.d:0 "There is heavy debate among the magisters as to what to do about the recent upheaval of the Regent Court pantheon. Many magisters have come back from Escann after fighting in the Greentide, providing the majority of the support for placing Corin as the successor to Castellos. Other more traditional magisters, many of the same ones that forbid magisters leaving to fight the Greentide in the first place, still believe that Castellos' son Adean should be their next leader.\n\nAfter much deliberation, taking part over multiple days, the council has decided:"

 flavor_magisterium.25.desc:0 "Born in Vinerick, in the lands of Wex, like many other talented and influential mages, Crovan was taken into the Magisterium to study at the Imperial Academy at a young age, quickly distinguishing himself as one of the most naturally talented student in its history. He would later graduate from the academy and eventually, he was voted to lead it in 1419 at the age of 33 making him one of the youngest leaders of the Magisterium.\n\nCrovan's reign as grand magister began at the end of The Third Lilac War and just one year later after the death of Vincen "the Old Owl" Silmuna and the beginning of the Fourth Lilac War, Crovan would help change Cannorian history. The Silmuna Family halted the election process after the death of Vincen so Adenn "Skylance" Silmuna could rush home, getting there a day before the election. Adenn's Silmuna forces were ambushed by Lorentish and Wexonard forces and betrayed by many of his former allies in The Battle of the Moon Council. It isn't known how much Crovan was involved in the betrayal but many believe that his installment at such a young age and subsequent dealings with the new Wexonard Emperor were likely signs of conspiracy and political maneuvering. Following The Invasion of Damesear and the end of the war Crovan and the Magisterium was granted control over the western half of the Isle of Damesear. \n\nA master of both transmutation and enchantment schools, both Crovans lechery and wealth are vast in equal measure. He has sired numerous children, many who are set to become powerful mages in their own right.\n\nIt seems certain that Crovan's influence and magical prowess has secured the magisterial throne for his prodigious family for years to come."

An abyssal inky void, starless and with only the sound of the shuffling of papers and hushed words to give it any life at all. Weeks of effort sunk into one singular all-consuming purpose; to hide the death of a god. A decision come to after long, long debate between the powers that be within the nation, that this information was too dangerous, too inflammatory. A revelation that could tear Cannor asunder.\n\n It is now, in the depths of this dark night, that the crux of this plan comes to fruition. They will hide the slowly piling evidence, censor it and bury it deep, deep within the capital to rot. A sound plan, to the minds who have desperately devised it.\n\n When [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their cadre of most trusted advisors and confidants arrive, they are shocked to find a haggard looking magister staring back at them. Instantly the magister launches into an explanation, that the magisterium has heard of what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was planning, and has decided to assist them, agreeing with their principal theory. The information is too dangerous, and the Grand Magister insisted on taking the evidence to hide within the depths of the Imperial Archives, never to be found.\n\n Between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the Magisterium, this terrible, terrible secret will surely remain hidden."

It holds the power to shake the faith of the continent to its very core, to break it, even. Thus, in a secret and private meeting, the Magisterium comes to a decision.\n\n Days later, and a Magister returns with satchels full of documents, evidence. The terrible truth, written in plain text. As the papers are stored in the depths of the Imperial Archives, the universal edict is silently passed to each of the highest members of the Magisterium.\n\n No one must ever know.\n\n Despite protests from the Grand Chronicler, our decision stands absolute, and any internal dissent is squashed. Yet paranoia remains. The protest of the Chroniclers makes it apparent that they are the most likely to speak of this, to let the world know of the death of a God. Unacceptable.

We have received an ultimatum - submit to imperial oversight, relinquish our control over ancillary institutions such as the Order of Chroniclers and the Imperial Archives, and cede most of our holdings to imperial princes.\n\nA fierce debate has erupted since news of this affront first spread through our hallowed halls. Should we teach these presumptuous lords and ladies of the empire, the emperor first among them, what happens if they dare to treat us like their peasant subjects? Or is the wiser course of action to play the long game and submit, at least in the eye of the public, and bide our time for an opportune moment to turn the tables and reestablish our hold over the empire?"

 flavor_magisterium.101.d:0 "News of the unprecedented treason committed by the highest ranks of the Magisterium have spread far and wide. Not only have they forsworn their sacred oaths by deceiving the Emperor and noble princes of Anbennar, they have undermined the very foundation their organisation was built upon. In an attempt to censor the mages and hold them accountable for their misdeeds, the Imperial Diet has decided to pursue a harsh course.\nNot only will the Magisterium be stripped of many of its traditional privileges, with control over institutions such as the Order of Chroniclers or the Imperial Archives transferred to other imperial offices, but most land holdings of the Magisterium will be handed out to trustworthy imperial princes – to purge the rot left by mage-rule, and exercise the Emperor’s will.\n\nYet, as severe as these sanctions are, they do little to assuage the concerns amongst our courtiers, who have been swept up in a wave of mistrust towards Magisterium-educated mages. They more or less openly accuse them of being spies for their masters in Old Damenath. This leaves us with a rather delicate choice: Should we follow public sentiment and deprive ourselves of their potentially invaluable services, or should we keep the mages around and risk being tainted by association?"

 flavor_magisterium.102.d:0 "News of the attempted suppression by the Magisterium of any truths considered unpalatable have spread far and wide. The organisation’s highest ranks have leveraged their influence over the Imperial Archives and the Order of Chroniclers to manipulate official records to portray a twisted version of the truth, omitting anything they deemed unfit for eyes other than their own. In their arrogance, they seem to have also made an effort to portray themselves as selfless servants of the empire at the same time.\n\nThis blatant abuse of power can be ignored no longer. If we want to forever end this deceitful practice, control over the Order of Chroniclers needs to be wrested from the Magisterium’s grasp. And so has the Imperial Diet has decreed – from now on the Order of Chroniclers and its associated Imperial Archives shall report only to the Diet and the emperor.\n\nBut as with many lofty decisions, the demon’s in the details. Excising all magisterial influence from the Chroniclers without crippling their ability to perform their duties in the short term is a tricky proposition. Some princes have seen fit to implement the Emperor’s decree in a more measured way, with a gradual, or delayed as some say, separation of those institutions."

 flavor_magisterium.103.d:0 "The news of the Magisterium’s attempted suppression of certain secrets deemed threatening to the stability of the empire, in particular the hints regarding Castellos’ demise discovered in Aelantir, have caused an uproar across the empire. Many call for harsh sanctions, and the severing of their control over key institutions like the Order of Chroniclers.\n\nHowever, the Emperor and the Imperial Diet have decided on a more measured approach. The diet has deemed the admission of guilt by senior members of the Magisterium as genuine – and accepted their protestations that they considered the secrets they suppressed only dangerous lies or half-truths at best, whose propagation would serve no purpose other than destabilising the foundations our empire has been built upon.\n\nWhile deeming it within their remit to judge whether such news should be allowed to spread might be considered an overzealous interpretation of their rights and duties, in the end the Magisterium considered it to be to the benefit of all within the empire.\n\nThus, the Magisterium has been bestowed an official imperial pardon, in return for a public renewal of their oaths by the entirety of the upper magisterial echelons. Not all, however, are content with this decision and the interpretation of events proclaimed by Grand-Magister and Emperor alike. Some call for us to take decisive action on our own."
