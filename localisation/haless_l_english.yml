 haless.1.t: "Harimari Roam Further Afield"
 haless.1.desc: "As supplies are packed and homesteaders  ready themselves for the journey ahead, our expedition leaders find several unexpected faces among the departing throng. Roaming Harimari have proved just as eager to explore new lands as their forefathers were, and seek permission to join the trek to new lands. The need to feed and supply these additional folk might add some strain to the project though.\nHow should our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] handle this new development?"
 haless.1.a: "Please come along! The more the merrier."
 haless.1.b: "Why you ought to be the experts. We’ll let you take the lead. "
 haless.1.c: "We cannot provide this much extra meat for the journey. The costs of feed or salt alone…"
 haless.1.d: "Why I know just what roles in the expedition would suit you."
 haless.1.e: "You may join the journey, but you’ll pay your own way. With administration fees."

 haless.2.t: "Roaming Spirits"
 haless.2.desc: "Reports come from a rural village in [roaming_spirits_province_target.GetName], these villages were impressively pious and had built up stable relationships with many spirits, leaving out libations and offerings to those that travel through and hosting festivals to honour those spirits they met. When they saw a group of tiger headed warriors draped in silk and golden jewellery they prostrated themselves before the strange spirit men, having never seen the Harimari before. While many Harimari hurried through, two of the young Harimari men enjoyed the hospitality of the faithful, drinking and eating through the village stores. When a travelling merchant explained the Harimari’s true nature, a local shaman grew furious and has since taken the harimari prisoner.\nOur priests and our community leaders are up in arms over this. What should we do?"
 haless.2.a: "These harimari boys are fools, but so are the men who believed them. Release them"
 haless.2.b: "If the travellers want their boys released, they will pay to replace what they took."
 haless.2.c: "Let the temples carry out their punishment. We do not mock the spirits."
 haless.2.d: "Send them to the spirits themselves, they will see justice dealt out."
 haless.2.e: "Tell my tax collectors “When someone asks if you’re a spirit, you say yes!”"

 haless.3.t: "Expert Travelers"
 haless.3.desc: "Harimari are famed throughout Haless as especially skilled Administrators, Courtiers and Generals, and many of the Harimari who choose to wander further from their homelands in Rahen and Yanshen bring those skills with them, making a living selling their trade to the rich and powerful who need a little extra help managing particular issues.\nNow a small caravan of these Roaming Harimari have emerged in the capital and offer help with your administration. The established courtiers are wary though, none suggesting that the extra hands wouldn’t help, but none volunteering to be the first to show their books to those outside the department."
 haless.3.a: "These scholars will ensure our censuses are up to date."
 haless.3.b: "These merchants will advise us on the flow of goods throughout the region."
 haless.3.c: "These sellswords will share their knowledge of tactical innovations."
 haless.3.d: "We trust our own above these outsiders. Send them on their way. "
 haless.3.e: "They ought to share all their knowledge, we can learn so much from each other."

 haless.4.t: "Harimari Sellsail"
 haless.4.desc: "While the harimari are feared throughout Haless as warriors and generals, for most the navies are still the domain of men. The larger harimari forms scarcely fit amid the tight confines and dangerous rigging of many sailing vessels. Some however, especially among the Roaming Harimari still take to the sea despite these difficulties, where they prove able to make good captains of themselves, with a particular skill in boarding actions. In the closer confines of a ship’s deck they can rip through smaller sailors before they have a chance to react.\nNow a Vandiphan captain has appeared on our shores, and offered his service as a naval commander."
 haless.4.a: "They will bring their fierceness to the high seas."
 haless.4.b: "The Navy is a poor fit for these folk, and promotion offers will keep our captains striving."

 haless.5.t: "Scholars Beyond the Temples"
 haless.5.desc: "It has long been considered a self evident truth that the high temples hold all the wisdom of the gods and that the proper place for many philosophers and monks is decoding the messages present in the reliefs, designs and geometries of those structures or else pondering and debating the nature of the heavens as explored through pure thought. However, many students and relatives of respected Roaming Harimari scholars have proposed the High Gods left proof of their divine purpose in other places, in the layout of hills and valleys, in the shapes formed by wind and weather. While some claim this as heresy, others within the community support this new philosophy and the leader of one such debate hall has come to ask for your blessing, hoping to bring their followers out of the high temples, and explore the world beyond."
 haless.5.a: "The temples must eternally be our priority."
 haless.5.b: "The High Gods’ influence is not bound to these complexes."
 haless.5.c: "We are familiar with the wisdom beyond the temples, send these scholars to other sites."

 haless.6.t: "New Accommodations Demanded"
 haless.6.desc: "The Roaming Harimari are newcomers to much of their current homeland, and unlike in Rahen or Yanshen they’ve never been an unchallenged ruling class. The codes of law we practise are derived from Nephrite codes or ancient human texts, without harimari having had the chance to carve out accommodations they now claim are necessary. Some of our structures are too small to comfortably accommodate them, and when they are in our care or service we have no obligation to provide them meat for their diet. They are in many easy to overlook ways foreign to us. Now a harimari scholar has come to our court with a list of amendments they claim are necessary to allow them to partake fully in our society."
 haless.6.a: "They deserve them, and their laws have built great empires in their homelands."
 haless.6.b: "We're under no obligation to treat them. The laws of our people have brought us this far."
