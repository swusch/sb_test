Yet the cowardly Sarnavani, thinking themselves safe behind their high walls and unwilling to risk drawing the ire of the Command, prohibited any intercession on behalf of the brave rebels of Sir.\n\nIt is clear to us that Sarnavan is undeserving of the fealty of the brave warriors of Tilathi.

Scattered throughout are relics of a long bygone age that bear a remarkable similarity to the most ancient parts of our sacred High Temples.\n\nIt is only fitting that the heroes of Shamakhad should be the ones exploring this remarkable land, but for this we need a proper foothold beyond the Godswall.

Bundled with the many blessings are also dangers, rare beasts and monsters lurking in the quiet places, remnants of the Dark Master’s foul creations, and hidden alcoves leading down towards the abyssal depths of the dwarven realms.

Restoring the roads, erecting pilgrim’s inns and encouraging the establishment of enterprises catering to the needs of the pilgrims has not only proven to be a boon to the local economy of our cities and hamlets along the pilgrim routes, but has allowed us to showcase our unique Khadisrapuri style of architecture to the wider world."

The courts were packed with guests and lavish feasts, cities celebrated, the lower castes had more wealth than some merchants in less fortunate parts of Rahen and order was preserved by the city guards, while raiding parties took care of external threats.\n\nBut that’s what led to the downfall of the old order: ignorance. They were too blind to see the threats lurking about, and the greedy grins of monstrous hordes who’d gladly see their happiness turned to sorrow. At that time, Khadisrapuri monarchs were looked upon suspiciously and called paranoid for wanting to have a functional levy system. Well, who’s laughing now?\n\nAlas, times have changed: Khadisrapur is now ascendant, and the north is in peace. We have proven to the people of Shamakhad that we can fight, but now it is time to also prove we can make them happy, a time to provide for the weak and encourage the ambitious, a time to shed our bloody clothes and done our party attire, and declare a Second Northern Age!"

According to these construction blueprints, the plans are wild and ambitious – the Heroes’ Guild is trying to construct a momentous central plaza which will surround their main building. This will be a place for heroes and adventurers to gather, rest, collect new quests, create a raiding party or look for a group.

But it can be quite disruptive to the status quo as well, and bring unintended consequences with it.\n\nOne such consequence of our slaying of the chimera has been the utter chaos engulfing the labyrinthine warrens found beneath the serene mountains of the Jade Mines.\n\nWithout a harsh overlord to keep everyone in check, the inhabitants of this underground world have swiftly descended into anarchy, with roaming warbands of goblins, scattered remnants of hobgoblin battalions and even some vengeful dwarven companies out for blood threatening to turn this sunless realm into a desolate wasteland.\n\nWe may not have intended this, but it is nonetheless our duty to put an end to the depredations and restore order."

 R11_eradication_command_title:0 "Eradication of The Command"
 R11_eradication_command_desc:0 "All the most seasoned hunters know that a cornered beast can be the most dangerous, even if wounded.\n\nThe chimera might have been chased from its hunting grounds back into its lair, but that does not mean it was slain. It was merely licking its wounds and biding its time to reemerge and bring chaos and despair to Shamakhad once more.\n\nWho amongst the Khadisrapuri would argue against the necessity of venturing deep into the dark underbelly of the mountains; to hunt down the beast and slay it once and for all?\n\nEspecially now that we are aware that the hobgoblins did not just enslave their orc and human subjects, but their distant kin as well - the myriad goblins dwelling in the caverns beneath, yearning for someone to free them from the hobgoblin yoke."

 R11_bruised_beaten_title:0 "Bruised and Beaten"
 R11_bruised_beaten_desc:0 "The centuries of internecine squabble between the goblin tribes of the Jade Mines have proven remarkably hard to subdue, but we Khadisrapuri do not shy away from daunting tasks.\n\nUnder our firm guidance, and sometimes a swift backhand slap, these myriad grudges accumulated over the generations have been, if not settled, then at least calmed to a degree that allows for a cautious cooperation between our goblin subjects.\n\nLeaving the murky depths of the mountains to those more than suited to it has thus become a real option, and a Jademarch comprised of those goblin tribes under our rule has been set up to rule the subterranean warrens in our name.\n\nThe fact that it would now be goblins lording over their hobgoblin kin, in a stunning reversal of fortune, might have sweetened the deal considerably."

 R11_civilizing_rabble_title:0 "Civilizing the Rabble"
 R11_civilizing_rabble_desc:0 "The goblin tribes of the Jade Mines have for the most part of their history alternated between carving out a meagre existence beneath the deep shadow cast by the dwarven holds, or else roaming the caverns and dwarven ruins as tribal hordes only a half-step above utter barbarism. Their utter subjugation forced upon them by their hobgoblin kin has not helped matters, leaving them scrambling to maintain a semblance of an organized society.\n\nBut all this must change if we are to truly make them a part of our large family of nations and races united under the throne of Khadisrapur. To ensure this, we need to bring the blessings of Raheni culture and civilization, grown over millennia in a much more forgiving environment, to the gloomy halls and crevices beneath the mountains. This would provide an obstacle to even the most determined teacher, yet who but us can live up to this visionary challenge?\n\nBringing the realm beneath the mountain and the lands above together as one is a task that will live on in the legends of both our peoples."

 R11_laws_indenturement_title:0 "Laws of Indenturement"
 R11_laws_indenturement_desc:0 "The hobgoblins have brought indescribable suffering and devastation to both the lands of Shamakhad and their former home beneath the mountain. Enforcing their penance for these crimes is a matter of justice; a correction which will aid them on their long way towards Nitikamarja. But most of those who actually committed these foul deeds have already perished on the battlefield or succumbed to old age. Keeping their descendants in eternal bondage would make a mockery of justice and bar the path towards Purtara for anyone who would enforce this. Instead, the laws of indenturement have been established, ensuring that the hobgoblins work for their redemption and the fruits of their labor are used to repair the damage they and their kin have caused. Those who serve diligently and demonstrate their remorse to eventually finish the terms of their indenture and become a free subject of Khadisrapur."

 R11_god_hope_title:0 "God Lost, Hope Found"
 R11_god_hope_desc:0 "Just like the orcs and goblins before them, the hobgoblins have shown their willingness and ability to become peaceful members of the great family of Rahen, united in their devoted pursuit of Nitikamarja. Who are we to deny them the hope of attaining Purtara? Who are we to cast judgment on them for the sins committed by their forefathers?\n\nLeft to their own devices, they misinterpreted the teachings of High Philosophy and became Godlost, but under our benevolent guidance, they have found their way onto the path of Nitikamarja. Seeing this profound change in a race that only decades ago was feared and pilloried across all of Haless is truly a marvel to behold. It is therefore only right to phase out the laws of indenturement, as they have served their purpose, and ensure that every hobgoblin is born free from now on - a sign of hope for all of us."

 khadisrapur.0.t:0 "The Lone Hero"
 khadisrapur.0.desc:0 "The Last of the First: this is how we are known, after the savage orcs and their hobgoblin commanders smashed their way through the Shamakhad kingdoms in an unrelenting campaign. Only ruins are left after the Command has tired and the dust is settling. Only ruins and… US…\n\nWe, as much as our cousins, enjoyed decades of decadence, as we traded, bickered, and occasionally schemed and fought against each other. But none of those past conflicts were anything like what the Command brought to Rahen. Army after army, settlement after settlement was sieged and defeated and ruined. All pleas and wishes to organize landed on deaf ears, as panic between our kingdoms spread much like the Command's troops…\n\nBut that´s the past now. This defeat is a wake-up call for the last of us. We will rebuild upon the remains and take down the Command! We have a clear goal on the horizon, and revenge burning within our hearts, much like the settlements that the Command conquered. We shall challenge very fate itself! But one question remains, my lord…\n\nShall we challenge fate and fortune alone, accepting our own redemptive burden, or shall we assemble a mighty coalition and defeat the Command with other brave heroes?"
 khadisrapur.0.a:0 "Our people failed to stop the Command once. And our people shall rectify that!"
 khadisrapur.0.b:0 "Only a coalition of heroes can take down such savage power!"
 khadisrapur.1.t:0 "The Return of Himmat the Hero"
 khadisrapur.1.d:0 "During the apex of the hobgoblin invasion in 1434, a number of nobles revolted against the ruling Jamma II Pirvand, rising in support of crown prince Balkevir Pirvand. The younger son of Jamma II, Balke became crown prince when his older brother, Himmat, relinquished his claims to the throne and chose the life of an adventurer. The young Balke was concerned by his aging father's reluctance to aid the faltering kingdom of Raghajandi, whose king was his wife's father. But Balke did not have the support of the army, which remained fiercely loyal to Jamma, and so he, his wife, and their supporters were defeated and sentenced to exile. In this way did Jamma II lose both of his sons.\n\nThat was a decade ago, and Khadisrapur has endured much in these ten long years. Now, though, the elder scion of the royal family has returned. The long-lost Himmat Pirvand has made his way to his father's court and now kneels before his father's throne to offer his services to his ailing fatherland. He is not alone; accompanying Himmat are the many mercenaries and adventurers he befriended in his travels. The man has changed - gone is the flamboyant firestarter, eager to prove himself. Instead, Himmat is now an experienced veteran and a hero of the people. He comes with radical ideas to modernize the military and has only one condition for his aid - that his younger brother be allowed to return to fight by his side."

 khadisrapur.2.t:0 "The Last Princess"
 khadisrapur.2.desc:0 "The tale of princess Kerita Deryajandi is one of dignified tragedy. Born into the bosom of the royal family of Sarilavhan, she grew up surrounded by her parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and a whole gaggle of cousins. Yet the hobgoblin invasion mercilessly culled the Deryajandi dynasty until only Kerita was left, saved only due to her being in the safety of the royal palace in Khadisrapur with her husband prince Balkevir.\n\nNow that we have wrested back control over our ancestral lands from the Command, restoring the princess to her family’s throne is not only the honorable thing to do, but chasing the hobgoblins from their stronghold in Sarilavhan as our next step in the reclamation of Shamakhad is essential for our own long-term survival.\n\nAs there is no other legitimate claimant to the lands of Sarilavhan, establishing Balkevir and Kerita as governors of her former homeland under the throne of Khadisrapur - once the hobgoblins have been vanquished once more - should not be met with serious opposition. This way, we can redress an injustice and expand our reach in one fell swoop."
 khadisrapur.2.a:0 "Don’t worry cherished princess, soon you will be in another castle!"
 khadisrapur.3.t:0 "The Northern March"
 khadisrapur.3.desc:0 "The lands to the east of the upper Yanhe have for the longest time been ruled by the kingdom of Ghatasak. But as with many other former ruin kingdoms, Ghatasak was inundated by the tidal wave of hobgoblins pouring out of their mountains.\n\nOnly by sheer luck did part of the royal family of Ghatasak manage to escape the demise of their homeland and eventually find their way to Khadisrapur. Of course we were honorbound to grant them shelter at our royal court.\n\nNow that the hobgoblin chimera has been forced to retreat and cede many territories they have unjustly occupied, the head of the Ghatasaki royal family in exile has come before [Root.Monarch.GetName] to plead their case.\n\nThey offer to swear fealty to the throne of Khadisrapur and serve loyally as our governors of their homeland, legitimising our control over Ghatasak, if only we lend them the support of our valiant armies and banish the Command from their former lands."
 khadisrapur.3.a:0 "Onwards to Ghatasak, brave warriors of Khadisrapur!"
 khadisrapur.4.t:0 "Southern Comrades"
 khadisrapur.4.desc:0 "Encouraged by our recent successes against the Command and hoping to regain their lost eastern lands, the brave heroes of Tilathi have expressed their fervent desire to join us in our next campaign against the hobgoblin menace. When news of this reached the royal court it was met with enthusiastic approval.\n\nYet it appears that their masters in Sarnavan have other plans and are firmly opposed to any action that might bring the Command’s retribution down on them. So whatever their original intentions, it appears that the stalwart people of Tilathi might have to free themselves from their chains before they can liberate their eastern brethren."
 khadisrapur.4.a:0 "Who are we to keep them from fighting to regain what is rightfully theirs?"
 khadisrapur.5.t:0 "Onwards!"
 khadisrapur.5.desc:0 "Only a scant few years ago it appeared as if the yellow-bellied naysayers and gutless collaborators might be proven right. Khadisrapur, the last, greatest heroic realm of Shamakhad, was pushed to the brink. Yet the flame of true courage never ceased to burn brightly within the breasts of all true Khadisrapuri patriots, and under the inspired guidance of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we achieved what no one but us thought possible - we not only halted the hobgoblins in their seemingly inexorable advance, but we pushed them back and freed many lands whose inhabitants had suffered under their yoke.\n\nOne such land was Sarilavhan, which has since flourished under the gentle yet firm rule of its last princess and her heroic spouse, both of whom have proven their value to our cause over and over."
 khadisrapur.5.a:0 "This is but the first of many victories, we shall not rest until the chimera is slain!"
 khadisrapur.6.t:0 "Voice of Tilathi"
 khadisrapur.6.desc:0 "The brave men of Tilathi have been in a dire situation not unlike ours, having lost much of their homeland to the dread hobgoblin chimera and its minions. Yet fate has blessed us, as we did not have to bear the chains of servitude to Sarnavan as well.\n\nBut their voice still rings out loud and clear, calling upon all righteous lords to join them and bring the fight to the Command. Those with courageous hearts cannot but see the justness of their cause, yet their chicken-hearted masters in Sarnavan have closed their ears to the pleas of those they swore to defend and protect.\n\nThis will stand no longer - the court and the people stand united and are ready to march in aid of liberating our brave Tilathi brothers from their shackles. The only question that remains is whether we should rely upon the honour of Sarnavan’s allies to stay out of this fight, or if we need to apply the considerable prestige gained by our recent victories to shame them into doing the right thing."
 khadisrapur.6.a:0 "Our place is at the side of the daring Tilathi, let them all try to stop us!"

 khadisrapur.7.t:0 "Heroes End Slavery!"
 khadisrapur.7.desc:0 "We have foolishly handed control over our slaves to the adventurers, many of whom believe themselves heroes of the underclass. Now one faction seeks to manumit them by force, while another is okay with paying us for a promise to not enslave more people."
 khadisrapur.7.a:0 "Try it and see!"
 khadisrapur.7.b:0 "We'll take that deal..."
 khadisrapur.8.t:0 "Thunder Strikes, Blood Spills!"
 khadisrapur.8.desc:0 "The Command did not bring only destruction upon our lands, but also orcs – savage tribals from the mountains blessed with strength alone. With no commanders to bark orders at them like dogs, they are lost like puppies too. They barely understand us, barely know how things work around here, and only have a penchant for fighting, following some obscure code of honor we find difficult to penetrate. Poor fools, in short, forced to live in strangers' lands.\n\nAs much as their very livelihoods are sad, we can't let them live in our core lands… but there is hope. Those who are loyal to us, to our cause, and swear upon their honor to stay loyal under punishment by death, shall be given a new home in the highlands of Shamakhad. Those who disobey shall be reintegrated into the very ground from whence they came.\n\nThe decision is final, and we shall message the surviving orcs."
 khadisrapur.8.a:0 "We won't kill you, but you can't stay here..."
 khadisrapur.9.t:0 "The Long March Begins"
 khadisrapur.9.desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the orcs and their few remaining leaders, the entire orcish population within our borders has started to assemble in huge cohorts. Preparations for their march towards the highlands shall start soon. As we have made clear, the highlands are theirs, their new homes. Settling the orcs in these hinterlands should offer some desperately needed space between our and their people, to calm down spirits and prevent conflict.\n\nSuch a journey wouldn’t be easy, at least for us Shamakhadi people. The roads and forests are filled with bandits, wannabe heroes, wolves, and potential spirits. But the orcs? They are hardy people. Both Bloodsong and Thunderfist orcs have shown their prowess on the battlefield. We still had our doubts, but the moment that they heard the promise of a permanent, settled home, they suddenly gained a spark of life within their hollow eyes. A determination to live emerged, and no obstacle will stop them in their long journey ahead. With only a handful of guides, they make their way to their new future."
 khadisrapur.9.a:0 "It's for the best to give them a new home."
 khadisrapur.10.t:0 "The Journey North Continues"
 khadisrapur.10.desc:0 "The march continues, though nothing that the orcs did not experience in the past with the hobgoblins. Wolves are turned into food and pelts, bandits merely combat practice, and the occasional foolish hero is shown his place, either by documents of our guides or the martial strength of the orcs. But the biggest obstacle on their journey is the terrain and the hobgoblin settlements. The highlands offer solid defence to anyone inhabiting these lands, not to mention the undeveloped roads up high, which in their disrepair cause plenty of casualties to the orcs too.\n\nBy the time the orcish cohorts began to arrive in the highlands, our guides were worried about the remaining, well-defended hobgoblin settlements. But unlike the roads and paths up the highlands, the hobgoblins were but a minor annoyance to the orcs. They smashed through the gates of these remote settlements like they were made of paper. The hobgoblin guards were torn to bits by their savage hands, immensely outnumbered. Finally getting revenge upon their past overlords spurred a blissful rage. Roars of hate and joy echoed through the highlands for days and months afterwards as they took over, settlement by settlement."
 khadisrapur.10.a:0 "Seems like it was a wise choice to give the orcs their personal space…"
 khadisrapur.11.t:0 "Orcs in the Land of Rahen"
 khadisrapur.11.desc:0 "Orcs and Rahen make for an odd combination. Same goes for the interaction between Raheni people and the orcs, now that they travel our freed countryside without their shackles. The only thing that they seem to respect and honor are our temples, but even that is at odds with their rather loud ways of paying what we assume is respect, or their odd practice of destroying precious pottery and porcelain as an offer to the spirits…\n\nThe oddest encounters are with orcs and bandits, which can go both ways, as orcs seem to pay most of their attention to strength matches or duels. In one moment, these orcs can help lone Heroes or caravan guards attacking bandits. In some other cases they help the bandits – when the bandit leader takes down the opposing leader, be it a guard, soldier, adventurer or even Hero. Does not matter who it is, but the stronger one is the righteous one in their eyes…\n\nOur advisors are similarly confused about how to deal with them. Some advocate teaching and converting them to our religion to bring understanding and unity between our people. Others recommend letting them continue their orcish practices and perhaps learning something from their religious practices to strengthen our unity. What shall we do?"
 khadisrapur.11.a:0 "Unity through plurality!"
 khadisrapur.11.b:0 "One faith united the people in Rahen, so shall it with the orcs too!"
 khadisrapur.12.t:0 "The Letter of Triumph"
 khadisrapur.12.desc:0 "Several days and nights were spent on writing this letter of triumph over the Command. Careful thinking about each word, each letter, and its impact upon the missive as a whole. More time was spent on thinking alone than writing. Countless pieces of precious paper were wasted. The grandeur, the length, and any errors were harshly dealt with, and yet no words came out from the pen. How could a writer even describe what happened in Shamakhad? How we gloriously defeated The Command? How each battle was carefully chosen, how each siege was planned for days, armies dancing back and forth through our lands? There was simply no way to put all that into one simple and cohesive letter. But after several sleepless days, the message was clear.\n\n“We were the last among the first to be defeated by the Command. Now we are the first to claim victory, I hope you won’t be the last to come and see our triumph.”"
 khadisrapur.12.a:0 "Sincerely, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]"
 khadisrapur.13.t:0 "An Unexpected Reply"
 khadisrapur.13.desc:0 "Among all letters coming into the capital, [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not expect to receive one from the Bloodsong Orcs. At first [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought that this might be a prank or someone jealous of our Heroic victory over the Command. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wanted to toss the letter into the trash, but… curiosity struck the Elephant, and so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got up and took a quick read:\n\n“The only thing first that you guys are is biting the dust on the battlefield! After we come back, we make sure that there will be only dust left in your lands!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] eyes were twitching. Quickly, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] crumbled the letter and tossed it to the side, sitting down. Hunched forward with an annoyed look, they took some time on what to do or reply. One of the many courtiers picked up the letter. His face went pale before turning red with hate as he remembered his home in Tilathimen was burned down by the Bloodsong Clan. “MY LORD!” he barely managed to wrangle out some words, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew already the answer."

There was no rehearsal or special tactics, no unique battle plans prepared. [Root.Monarch.GetName] simply raised the levies and sent them upon the last orc clan whose name still stained Rahen´s map. There was no grandeur, nor insulting speech worthy of them. Bloodsong would be trampled to the very dust with which they had insulted us, and none would record them, as their mention or existence was not worth the historic records nor history itself. Only our footsteps upon whatever lands they owned."

We are the last remaining Ruin Kingdom standing. We did our duty even when we were on our very knees, a mere battle away from being swept under the rug of history and conquest, and yet we managed to endure and rise!\n\nOur battle-hardened troops march across the region, welcomed by everyone; even the orcs give us praise as we finally gave them a home to call their own. Though the land they have been granted is rough, it's theirs alone, and for that they happily fight and defend our cause and name. And Haless? They are all spreading our name, our spirit, and how we defied all odds like the heroes in legends, struggling valiantly against an impossible end.

Yet I would be remiss in my duties if I did not report the worrisome developments that agitate the orcish laborers in your mines as of late. They are an honest and hardworking lot, yet desperately superstitious, and rumours of inexplicable noises and half-seen beings haunting the deepest mine shafts have made the rounds among them, driving them into a frenzy of superstitious dread where some even dare to refuse to enter these parts of the mine. I would have dismissed these reports as fanciful delusions if I did not receive credible reports that other mines in this and neighboring provinces are suffering from similar unrest.\n\nWhile for now the miners continue to do their duty, I fear what may happen if these mysterious disturbances were to persist. As the deepest parts of our mine is filled with clefts connecting them to deep caverns leading to places only the High Gods may know, it is beyond the abilities of this humble servant and his capable retinue of overseers to uncover the cause of these hauntings.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I therefore implore you to send aid; we are in desperate need of courageous heroes who can put an end to these unwanted intrusions."\n--report of Balbir Janda, chief mine overseer, Khuhatamba mining camp, Tamvihar province"

 khadisrapur.17.desc:0 "Later generations of scholars would study the treaty of Sarnihanpur as a piece of political brinkmanship, one that played a pivotal role for the future of Rahen and beyond.\n\nThe traditionally close ties between the royal houses of [rajnadhaga_or_was_rajnadhaga_target.GetName] and Khadisrapur were leveraged by the ambitious rulers of both realms into a binding treaty that divided all of Shamakhad up between the two realms. While at the time of the signing of the treaty, this was more boisterous claim than factual reality, it was a clear declaration of intent that would be realised over the coming decades.\n\nWhile at a first glance the treaty apportioned the lion's share of Shamakhadi territory to Khadisrapur, this was mostly land ravaged by decades of war and oppressive exploitation by the hobgoblin Command. [rajnadhaga_or_was_rajnadhaga_target.GetName] on the other hand laid claim to the rich and comparatively defenseless states to the south, for the most part untouched by the calamity that befell their northern neighbors."

 khadisrapur.18.desc:0 "Aves was born into a modest household, raised by a humble and honest quilter in the town of Taraja, south of Khadisrapur. In his younger years, he proved himself a formidable thrower in the local ball-throwing games, even challenging one of the old Sharaajaghaal champions and nearly defeating him. Yet the life of a sportsman was not his calling, and Aves soon found himself taking on various maintenance jobs for wealthier patrons.\n\nOne day, while repairing a magelight caster for a prominent local mage, Aves had an idea. If these magelights could be stored in some sort of bubble, and infused with enough mana within that same container to sustain the spell, it might be possible to illuminate an entire room using a single, basic enchantment. Intrigued, the mage agreed to let Aves experiment with some of his tools.\n\nAt sunset one evening, near the mage’s unassuming shop in the bazaar, a curious crowd began to gather. After many failed experiments, Aves stood ready, holding a long, thick cord made of carefully woven silk, several shimmering bubbles suspended along its length.\n\nHe tied the string between two pylons, the glowing orbs swaying gently in the air. Stepping back, he gave the mage a small nod. The mage took an unusually long time to cast his spell—but then, suddenly, the bubbles flared to life, bursting with radiant light. The entire square was transformed. The crowd stood in astonishment as new possibilities—vast as the sky—dawned upon them."

Reaching the fabled holds hidden deep beneath the surface to ascertain their current state has therefore remained beyond our capabilities.\n\nWe have gone to some lengths to recruit Amethyst and Peridot Dwarves willing to lead further expeditions into the mountain's depth, but for all their innate affinity for this environment, they are no more familiar with it than our human heroes. Emissaries sent out to the secluded Nephrite Dwarves of Verkal Ozovar, in hope of acquiring ancient maps from the time of the Jade Empire, have returned empty handed.\n\nJust as we were ready to concede defeat and cancel any further expedition into the depths, news of an unexpected offer has been relayed by one of the scouting parties.

Behind this portal an aspiring hero could find a massive complex of assembly halls, training rooms, supply depots and arsenals carrying everything they might need, the quest offices where supplicants both foreign and domestic were matched with adventurers suitable for the task and many other amenities for the visiting guild members. But for Ranjit the only important part, at least today, was the central registrar office, where he could present his credentials and at last begin the process of becoming a full member of the Guild in good standing.\n\nIn any other city of Rahen the guildhall would be considered a palace fit for aristocrats, but here in Khadisrapur it was a point of pride to house their heroes in such a sumptuous environment. As he wandered along the corridors in search of his destination, attempting not to be too obvious staring at the marvels that surrounded him, he noticed traces of the decorations used for the grand opening ceremony only a week prior.

But even the darkest of nights has to end with the glorious rise of dawn. And in the depth of night, salvation came in the form of the valiant Khadisrapuri heroes who dispersed the besiegers and greeted the light of dawn arm in arm with their Tilathi brothers.\n\nThe days of the hobgoblin menace are fortunately long behind us now, but the memory of the sacrifices endured by our predecessors in defense of all of Shamakhad should never be forgotten.\n\nThus, the provincial governor of Naraka has procured an impressive fund to turn the old fort into an enduring monument of the valor shown by these finest of warriors. Unsurprisingly, it has become one of the major destinations for adventurers and aspiring heroes visiting our lands on pilgrimage. Standing high up on the walls of the fort, meditating on the feats of heroism these stones have witnessed, they hope to be blessed with even a modicum of the valiant spirit demonstrated by the heroes of old."

Unlike the orcs that sit on the lower caste thanks to their raw physical might, half-orcs, who also swarm the lower caste along with their parental people, and started to outnumber them too, and unlike the orcs and their natural aggression, are much more refined and tactical thanks to their human side.

As with his architectural aesthetic, he took centuries-old lyrical conventions and poetic style and blended them into something new and inspiring. By taking the sparse poetry of Sarilavhan with its hobgoblin influences and marrying it to the traditional Khadisrapuri epic poem, he expressed the zeitgeist of contemporary Shamakhadi poetry in a uniquely captivating way.\n\nBoth his interest in the architecture and poetry of Shamakhad fuelled the passion that would define his later life - the history of his homeland and the political philosophy he derived from his studies of the ancients. Using the patronage of his aristocratic benefactors he began to gather an impressive collection of ancient texts and historical artifacts and even conducted the first archaeological excavations in Rahen to shed light on the lost history of early Shamakhad.\n\nThe passionate and erudite accounts of his historical findings and the philosophical treatises based on his studies have spread like wildfire amongst our people, no matter which caste they belong to, fostering a sense of unity and pride in their heritage and achievements.

All of this would mirror the practices of the Cannorian powers where he himself received his military education.\n\nThis time however, some dissenting voices can be heard amongst his cadre of promising young officers who have risen in prominence during the implementation of his reforms.

Twirls like duels. Anklets like weapons. Hair flying, feet crashing down in rhythm. Some watched, dumbstruck by grace. Others couldn’t help themselves—rising from their seats, swept into the fever.\n\nChildren climbed onto shoulders. Vendors abandoned their stalls. Foreign guests locked arms with strangers. A minor noble was last seen belly-dancing atop a fruit cart.

There is an additional claim of this mushroom-like substance helping your workers concentrate, allowing for a greater yield in your tithe.\n\n“On the other hand, Plek of Blackstep argues this cave rightly belonged to Blackstep and its people long before the… ‘gem crunching snot for brains’, had any say in the matter. There was a mention of the aforementioned substance and its qualities increasing the pain tolerance of warriors, allowing them to ignore wounds most would deem fatal. Both very promising offers indeed – but only one of you will be granted this plot of cave and that will be the end of it. This dispute has run its course far and wide enough, and quite frankly more important matters need to be addressed.""
