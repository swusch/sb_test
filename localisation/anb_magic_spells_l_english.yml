 magic_spell.800.t:0 "The Golden Child"
 magic_spell.800.d:0 "There has always been controversy around the performance of the rites of conception, owing in part to the great regional variation that accompanies the practice. In some cultures, the rites extend to the imbibing of certain potions and the inhalation of certain smokes by the pregnant party. In others, the rites require the conceiving of twins, one of whom must kill the other in the womb. In the years to come, there will be rumors about the nature of this one's conception and birth. There will be no question, however, as to their magical talent. From a golden-colored pool, the child emerges. Their eyes are already open, peering curiously at you with preternatural sight."

It is as though their life is a grotesque parody of the one they were meant to live. Some cultures practice the rite of conception by conceiving twins and having one kill the other. In this case, it seems the wrong child survived.\n\nThe babe stares one wicked eye at you, and emits a brutish, hacking laugh. My magic was stronger, they seem to say. My magic survived."

All matter of unguents were applied to the [Root.Consort.GetTitle], flesh grafted and rituals spoken that even we half-understood. Now here are the effects of it all: on the date of the birth, when celebrations were being prepared just downstairs, the child delivered itself via bisection, and crawled out of its mother's throat fully-grown.\n\nIt has eyes where it ought to have teeth, and teeth where it ought to have hair. Not a single person present to witness the delivery survived, and the guards are still unable to bring it down."
