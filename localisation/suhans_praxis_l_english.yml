 suhans_praxis_events.1.t:0 "Liberation of the Sexes"
 suhans_praxis_events.1.d:0 ""We do not build the Golden Palace for our own comfort! It is the form and institution in which we are to seek Purtara together, not the mere hall of a Prabhi! Go and ask the lazy husband of his theology, and you will hear that reserved for him is dekhana, ascertaining, and for his wife pichka, pursuing. This is to say, he decides what is to be done and she does it…\n\n"Let me repeat - on the path to Purtara, there is no misstep more profound than to hinder the journey of others. I have said this to you of the commercial slaver, and I say it too of the thousandfold more common domestic slaver, whose victims, perversely, are his very own family. We forget to our peril that only those who lay the bricks will live in this particular Palace.""

 suhans_praxis_events.2.t:0 "Diplomacy of the Gurus"
 suhans_praxis_events.2.d:0 ""Across Haless we rightly possess great respect for those who close themselves away and seek wisdom. You Teleni are a little like this here, maybe, with your city of cloisters! But even Balris said the monk must come down from the mountain. All of you know that we die and are born and live again, that we live myriad lives on our route to Purtara. It is as important to fill our lives with experiences as it is to ruminate upon them.\n\n"Imagine that I had never left Guhe. For one, I wouldn’t be here with you, sweating my head off from Anjar’s delicious phaal… I would be smaller, and not just at the waistline. It is true we cannot be a land of only mendicants, and you’re all much too upstanding to freeload around as I have… but even the next town over has its own phaal mix, and what a shame to live without tasting it.""

 suhans_praxis_events.3.t:0 "Horizons of the Mind"
 suhans_praxis_events.3.d:0 ""Lovely Kharta, wittiest of us all! Always you speak as if I have no love for this place, as if I do not understand the desire to hole oneself up in the grand libraries and never come out. For the irrepressibly curious such as we, this is the true capital of Rahen.\n\n"You believe that I seek to end the philosopher, to destroy his relevance and importance in Halessi culture. The precise opposite is true! Atma is not grain, used up when distributed from the granary. Conceive for a moment the flowering Visvatma of myriad literate millions, hand in hand along the Nitikamarja. Remember the wisdom of the Ghankhedeni, who teach us that he who opens the door is remembered for his welcome.""

 suhans_praxis_events.4.t:0 "Paradigmatic Zeal"
 suhans_praxis_events.4.d:0 ""There is a sickness at the heart of the harimari. We are natural competitors, and we have come to believe that none other may rise without our own descent. Often I have sat in the homes of corporals, usually invited by their wives, and been asked how I expect we harimari to retain power, to go to war, without the strength and prowess imparted by the Unbroken Claw.\n\n"To this I ask: what remains of Harimar’s domain? No harimari rules my birthplace, and it is not for lack of martial prowess. What we harimari continue to miss is the power of belief to defeat authority, the paradoxical unity of a teeming mass of individuals whose atma is, for a universal moment, flowing towards one spot.\n\n"It is a lesson the harimari will learn, or we will perish.""

 suhans_praxis_events.5.t:0 "Debate the Nature of the Praxis"
 suhans_praxis_events.5.d:0 ""The Starry Eye that turns to the heavens must also peer inwards. This is that pesky principle of rumination, the ‘wisdom of the cud’ of which we scholars are always talking. But my people, we are only speaking of the cow, whom you farmers know best of all…\n\n"Those who in their atavistic fear flee from disputation have already fractured the manifold truth of the Darsanasara. They have torn a scrap from a tapestry and claim to still hold the whole thing, and even worse, they won’t let you read the bit they have! I say to you - respect none who will not argue for their convictions.""
 suhans_praxis_events.5.a:0 "Oration Six, Kranakol"
 suhans_praxis_events.6.t:0 "All Walk the Nitikamarja"
 suhans_praxis_events.6.d:0 ""How embarrassing to find so much profound wisdom in the Bulwari solar metaphor, only to tangle oneself in the specific ritual and protocol of Rahen like some fussy seneschal. The Nitikamarja is not a game of dice. We cannot tally up our points and odds and hope to pass over some imaginary numerical threshold into Purtara!\n\n"The possibility which terrifies the philosophers is this: that somewhere in the darkest hole of the Serpentspine, a hobgoblin incapable of writing her own name has peeled away the layers of her soul, revealed its Radiance and stepped into Purtara. That you have, or your wife has, and they, for all their vaunted scholarly discipline, have not.""

 suhans_praxis_events.7.t:0 "Promote the Long Path"
 suhans_praxis_events.7.d:0 ""In this city I weep; in this city I hope. Twenty years ago, when Keo first invited me here - he’s the one hiding next to that statue - I saw the crossroads just next to the customs house, on the way downhill towards the Baashidi Steps. Houses of the Orange Sash, Unbroken Claw and Starry Eye all glowered at each other, and on the fourth corner of the crossroads? A tavern, of course…\n\n"Ours is the path to the tavern door. Behind it we find friend, enemy, savage; the pitiable and the enraging. Each has something to teach us.""
