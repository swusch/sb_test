 noukahi_pantheon_religion_desc:0 "The Nouakahi Pantheon is a loosely connected collection of stories concerning heroic figures to the Vurebindu and Irsukuba people of Horashesh. The religion borrows heavily from neighbouring Fangaula, Nakavy Avo, and Khetist myths, meaning there are very few unifying themes. Instead each tale has different teachings and meanings, often varying depending on the person telling the story."

 HOLY_SITE_5863_DESC:0 "The shattered spire at Lake Kuiziva is so obviously not of this world, and many tales mythologising its true origins exist. For the people of Fangaula, it stood as the furthest point of their once mighty empire, and is said to be a bridge to the moon and a spirits final resting spot. For the people of Horashesh, it was where the warlord Kui announced his divinity. Legend says the spire started to sparkle with the light of the stars as he spoke, proving his status as the god's chosen."
 HOLY_SITE_6599_DESC:0 "In defence of the Vurebindu people, the creator Zuvanofa slayed the king of the genies in battle. However, he was wounded in the process. His consort, Noromhanda, took him to the Temple of Lel to heal, summoning seahorses to help bandage his wounds. As with many of the stories in the Noukahi Pantheon, there’s likely a grain of truth behind centuries of myth, as variations of this story also exist in the Nakavy Avo religion. The Temple of Lel is very real though. It still stands in the centre of Lelanán today, its walls adorned with seahorse mosaics."
 HOLY_SITE_5808_DESC:0 "The volcano Junansuar is home to a former Efreeti palace which has been transformed into a monastery dedicated to the divine blast kiln Mojobaa. Deep within the volcano, legends say Mojobaa forges weapons and tools in a divine workshop to combat God’s and creation’s enemies. Monks known for their exceptional blacksmithing skills tend the holy site, crafting powerful ironwood steel weapons imbued with elemental magic."
 HOLY_SITE_5941_DESC:0 "Lizardfolk are the ancient enemy for the people of Horashesh. Here before Zuvanofa created the world, they are considered an eternal threat to humanity. But that does not mean there is no respect for their culture and civilization. When the Ikilshebe warlord Nyokyora pushed deep into the lizardfolk jungle, his fellow warriors came back speaking in awed tones about the cities they uncovered. In the centre of the great city of Nahzni stood a circle of spires, each almost as large as the Kuiika Gamyi, appearing as though they were hewn from the stars themselves."
 HOLY_SITE_6063_DESC:0 "The first humans to cross the Salahad into Noukahi were led by Ardim, the chosen hero of Zuvanofa. She took them on a great procession across desert, mountain, swamp, and sea, until they landed at Ardim Qarast. There, she founded a great civilisation that stood for millennia, until it was buried by sand and sea. Variations of this story can be found all across Sarhal, although most historians scoff at the idea it could be real. To find this mythical city would upend our understanding of history."
 HOLY_SITE_5481_DESC:0 "Centuries of Kheteratan rule has its impact on one's faith. Certain figures cross religions if their stories are compelling enough, for there is nothing those following the Noukahi Pantheon love more than a good story. That is how Niramhat came to be. In Khetism she is Nirakhet, mother of Elikhet, whose tears pooled at Lake Nirakhet and became the enchanted river of The Sorrow. In the Noukahi Pantheon she is Niramhat, the All-Queen, and husband of Zuvanofa. But the tale of her tears creating The Sorrow is told across both faiths, making Lake Nirakhet a sacred place for both religions."
 HOLY_SITE_6690_DESC:0 "The Echenka are long-lost brethren of the Irsukuba people who never migrated to Horashesh. Instead they lived in the Rakkazi Highlands, on the outskirts of what was once their lush and green homeland: The Shadow Swamp. The legend amongst the Irsukuba people is that the great hag Hireet Gloomweaver offered the queen of the Echenka, Lama Kerac, the ability to revive her recently deceased husband. The spell worked, but in returning color to her husband, the Queen’s body was cursed. Everywhere she stood drained color from the land itself. In an attempt to contain the shadow's spread, she nailed herself to the Shadowroot Matriarch where she supposedly still resides. While the tale has many meanings to the Irsukuba people, the main message is quite simple: Never make a deal with the hags."

noukahi_pantheon.2.t:0 "The Taste of Failure"
noukahi_pantheon.2.d:0 "It is in man’s nature to trip twice on the same stone. We fail and sin, we indulge in vices and crimes, and we do this despite no such action being without fair punishment in due time. To break this cycle of depravity, to pursue virtuousness and emulate the moral paragons that preceded us; that is what the Griots teach, that is the cornerstone upon which the Noukahi Pantheon is built.\n\nAnd yet, it seems these teachings fell on deaf ears for you. When you embarked on this pilgrimage, did you think the heinous actions you would commit, desecrating such a sacred journey, would be without consequence? Did you still believe there would be a reward at the end of your path? Did you hope the Gods would overlook your wicked ways? You were wrong and foolish, and you wasted your time.\n\nNo use now in crying and lamenting. Shame has been brought to your house by your failure and vice, it is upon your shoulders to get up and right your wrongs. Perhaps, as the sting of shame mercilessly torments your heart, the pain will push you to change and improve, or perhaps you will remain shameless in your ignominy, and stay forever sunk in the darkness. Yours alone is the power to choose if the songs of the Griots will remember you with sneering and manifest contempt, or if you will earn a more favorable place in the memories of your people.\n\nIf the latter is your goal, look now inwards and reflect, for to recognize the disease is the first step to extirpate it. Which flaws brought you to failure? How will you right your wrongs?"
noukahi_pantheon.2.a:0 "I did nothing wrong! Misfortune befalls me for no fault of mine!"

noukahi_pantheon.3.t:0 "Gamyi at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.3.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] crests one last hill, a vivid scene unfolds before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]: to the south, Lake Kuiziva stretches out to the horizon, its placid surface dancing with the light of the setting sun; to the north, the rolling hills of the Kuiika countryside rise gently from the coastal flats, shimmering gold in the light breeze; and ahead the object of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s long pilgrimage looms, impossibly tall, a gleaming pillar of light against the deepening mauve of the oncoming night: the Kuiika Gamyi.\n\nWith the setting sun behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], [Root.Monarch.GetName] continues towards the spire. To either side of the coastal road, a profusion of graves and memorials stand - some new, some weathered almost beyond recognition - solemn reminders of the countless battles fought here over the millennia. Ahead, a respectable city clings to the base of the great structure, toylike in comparison. Throngs of pilgrims crowd the streets; merchants hawk their wares. [Root.Monarch.GetName] pays them no mind, transfixed by the looming tower. Belly lurching with vertigo, they press on through the crowd.\n\nAt last they stand before the Gamyi, and, gingerly, rest a palm upon its featureless surface. At first, nothing: a twinge of fear. Then, everything at once: the cosmos flowing through their veins, a kaleidoscope of ages past. Electric. Terrifying. Then, peace. An insight gained. A gift bestowed. With a sense of fullness, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns about, ready for the long trek home."
noukahi_pantheon.3.a:0 "My legions will fight like those of the great Kui!"

noukahi_pantheon.4.t:0 "Lelanán at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] steps ashore to a cacophony of crying gulls, before setting off into the bustling port city of Lelanán. The sights and sounds are overwhelming in their variety and intensity, and it takes all of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s concentration just to stay the course toward the city’s namesake attraction, following the Pilgrim’s Road as it winds its way like a river through the chaotic, colourful, organic city.\n\nThe midday gongs ring as [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally stands before the Temple of Lel. It is surprisingly humble for its fame, and very much of its city in terms of architecture: whitewash walls, a tiered roof topped with an onion dome, bas reliefs depicting marine life banding the exterior. At the behest of a low-ranked halfling priestess, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is ushered in.\n\nThe air is cool within, and laced with a refreshing hint of ozone. Mosaics featuring sea horses, merfolk, araizary and other sea creatures adorn the walls. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is shown into the heart of the temple, a circular room with a perfect half-sphere pool of crystal-clear water at its centre. Stepping forward, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gingerly sets one foot upon the pool: the surface tension does not break. Cautiously, [Root.Monarch.GetName] assumes a meditative pose and tries to calm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind. Imperceptibly, a feeling of peace descends. Minutes pass, hours, until time loses its meaning. When [Root.Monarch.GetName] wakes, it is dark out. Drenched in Lel’s serenity, the night holds no menace. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sighs in contentment, and begins the journey home."
noukahi_pantheon.4.a:0 "Peace and comfort for all who ail."

noukahi_pantheon.5.t:0 "Jununsuar at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.5.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks through the ironwood tree-lined path to the mountain, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cannot help but feel small. Even the great metallic trees are dwarfed by the majestic size of Mojobaa’s home. The great volcano of Junansuar, on whose slopes stands what once was a genie palace, now a great monastery and [Root.Monarch.GetName] destination. At the end of the path, a long and steep flight of stairs rises towards the monastery’s doors. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is out of breath when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] reaches the top, and takes a moment to rest before entering through the immense iron doors, wide open to welcome all pilgrims.\n\nThe first thing [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] notices, even before stepping inside, is the heat—stronger than midday in the desert. Then comes the noise: metal clashing with metal, the ironwood from the strange trees of the Dao Nako hammered into perfect weapons.As [Root.Monarch.GetName] continues onwards, following the pilgrim flow, the sun eventually stops reaching into the immense halls, the orange glow of the forges now the sole source of light. The heat, the noise, the charged air:[Root.Monarch.GetName] feels [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind becoming overwhelmed, lost in itself. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] continues, walking almost unconsciously, as if pushed by an unseen force.\n\nThen [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sees it: a column of clear light. The monastery opens to the air, a wide, gardened circle in the middle of the complex. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] steps inside, the heat, noise, and air cease to be a concern, and a sense of comfort envelops [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. This is where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is meant to be. In the middle of the garden stands a lone ironwood tree, the greatest stand [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen. [Root.Monarch.GetName] places a hand on its bark, expecting to feel the hard coldness of iron. Instead, it is warm, like a mother’s embrace."
noukahi_pantheon.5.a:0 "Make sure to take notes for our smiths at home"

noukahi_pantheon.6.t:0 "Nazhni at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.6.d:0 "For centuries, lizardfolk and men have waged bitter war against each other, a conflict that left both sides little chance to appreciate the other’s architecture, lest it be minutes before being put to the torch. Seeing the great sights of the port city of Nazhni, now open to the Noukahi faithful, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can do nothing but lament that war, as righteous as it was, stood between mankind and this beauty.\n\nNazhni was always a city of artists, of pleasure and comfort, and so it remains. Great colourful buildings adorn every street, functionality a second thought, beauty the priority. From the temples to the great mansions, the resorts for the wealthy, and even the humble homes of the city workers, the whole city sings in harmony with a myriad of colours.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] crosses through the bustling market, avoiding the hordes of merchants offering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] wares from all corners of Halann. The central square of the great city is filled with bazaar stalls, as colourful as the rest. At its centre, a circle of spires rises: replicas of the great Zatsarya that stand across Sarhal. [Root.Monarch.GetName] runs [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand over their delicately sculpted surfaces, upon which the stars of countless night skies are etched.\n\nSome Griots sing that when Nyokyora, centuries ago, had the city razed and toppled every last brick, he did so because his warriors had become so entranced by its beauty that they would otherwise never have left. [Root.Monarch.GetName] understands why. The city is more addictive than the Nazhyn sold in its markets; it enters the mind and conquers it with a symphony of hues. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must leave now, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] soul aches knowing this. Yet, in a way, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will never leave. One can never truly leave Nazhni, for once you enter, your heart is forever dyed with the city’s million colours."
noukahi_pantheon.6.a:0 "A great inspiration for our architects!"

noukahi_pantheon.7.t:0 "Ardim Qarast at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.7.d:0 "The desert of Ardimya is hard and unyielding, and demons most foul populate the endless dunes. The Guryadagga tribes that populate the lands whisper that it was not always so, that once the peninsula shined green and fertile, waterways filled to the brim crossing what now are accursed wastelands. A long-lost paradise whose last ruins lay now between the ever-shifting sands and the scorching sun. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sees now the greatest of these ruins, once a great city of domed roofs and rising aqueducts, now a place where stone slowly dissolves into the sand, the domes long collapsed, the aqueducts run dry.\n\nMany Griot tales deal with the folly of clinging to eternity, for this is a privilege only Gods can enjoy, and even the greatest works of the greatest kings fall to the ravages of time. Yet the wise can learn much from the past, and memories well stored are as incorruptible as the divine. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks through the once empty ruins, now filled with pilgrims, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sees this with special clarity. What once was, now is, as alive today in the minds of the faithful and the texts of the scholars as it once was in the material world. From precious relics rescued from the sands to worn engravings painstakingly replicated in paper, the site is the source of countless materials that will grant the wisest of [Root.GetName] with material for days and days of debate.\n\nYet it is not to practice archeology that [Root.Monarch.GetName] came to these distant lands. Each step through the ancient city brings one closer to heroes long past. To Ardim, chosen by Zuvanofa to deliver humanity from the tyranny of the genies, and who did just that despite, if the Guryadagga accounts are to be given credit, being a Djinn herself. The wind lifts the sand in strange patterns, and in its hypnotic movements, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can see the future and the past, what came and what will come. Walking through Ardim Qarast, one is walking through the sands of time itself."
noukahi_pantheon.7.a:0 "The wisdom of the ages is revealed to us here!"

noukahi_pantheon.8.t:0 "Kunolo at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.8.d:0 "Pilgrimages are not supposed to be particularly fun. Some particularly strict Griots would even tell you any enjoyment and pleasure is a distraction from the sacred duty of reflection all pilgrims have. And despite this, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is having the time of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life in Kunolo: talking to the merchants of the Kekwiw bazaar, who come from all corners and cultures of Sarhal and beyond; sampling the strange and exotic delicacies offered in their stalls, and washing down the meals with reinvigorating Kola nut juice. For an outside observer it would seem like [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is completing ignoring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] task as a pilgrim, but the truth is, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is submerged precisely in the nature of the divine, the way Kunolo perceives it.\n\nThe myriad shrines of the Kekwiw Bazaar fill the place with harmonic divine energy; they impose calm, happiness and merriment in all who visit. Even those who enter the healing temples following regal looking Kiumbanda priestesses seem to be joyous. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has heard the flesh-bending process these holy sorcerers practice is excruciating to the extreme, and yet those that seek a cure to their ailments, or to mold their body in a way that better fits their soul, happily endure the pain to obtain such a reward. Even the most conservative Griots, who would normally be outraged at such practices, dare not question the craft of the Kiumbanda, blessed by the god Kunolo as it is.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] jumps from shrine to shrine, and from stall to stall, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] explores the bazaar. Night envelops the city before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has had a chance to visit even half. Tomorrow [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will leave Kunolo with sorrow in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart, but the memory will remain, a memory of harmony and understatement, in a city that welcomes all."
noukahi_pantheon.8.a:0 "A great opportunity for our diplomats to learn about foreign customs."

noukahi_pantheon.9.t:0 "Niramit at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.9.d:0 "They call it the City of Tears. The waters of the Sorrow gently drift towards the horizon, leaving the sacred lake that sees the river born. [Root.Monarch.GetName] silently watches the river flow, meditating on the origin of the fluvial wonder. The tears of Niramhat, or perhaps Nirakhet, mother of all, the All-Queen. Does she weep for all truly? Even for the wicked and the rotten? Even for the astray and the lost? [Root.Monarch.GetName] almost finds it hard to believe. The Gods are good, but they are seldom ever compassionate, their divine wills enforced without consideration or doubt. That is what the Griots have always taught.\n\nA Khet sunbathes near the lake, lazily chewing the grapes that a miserable looking servant feeds him. Are these capricious creatures also targets of the All-Queen mercy? What about their worshippers, who so tormented Horashesh for generations, seeking to enslave it and erase its people’s cultures in their blind pursuit of wealth and power? How could anyone ever forgive that? How could anyone weep for men with hearts so dark and cold? [Root.Monarch.GetName] can hardly wrap [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head around it.\n\nIt is true, nevertheless, that many tales sing of the virtue of offering a hand to the vanquished foe, of rising above evil-doers by showing them the mercy they did not offer their victims.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] leaves [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] doubts and questions aside from a moment as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] enters the placid waters of the lake. A sense of overwhelming calm and relief surrounds [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], beyond what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has felt in ages. The tears of the mother bring comfort and peace to her children. Perhaps, following her example, one can learn to forgive."
noukahi_pantheon.9.a:0 "May this experience lead us to greater peace and understanding."

noukahi_pantheon.10.t:0 "Sprigi Twani at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.10.d:0 "In the old days, a journey through the Shadow Swamp was something undertaken only by the foolish, the mad or the suicidal. While not all of the dangers in the region have been completely banished yet, the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetName] can, like many other faithful, safely make pilgrimage to the great tree in Sprigi Twani is proof that light is at long last winning in its eternal battle against the shadows.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] admires the strange nature of the Swamp as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walks the paved path carved that now leads to its epicenter. Great Lotunga Pines stand guard, half-choked by Hattiatia coils. Night Blossoms lurk, their pure black color much more distinct in a Swamp that now shines green rather than its old foul grey. From a nearby pond, a great crocodilian stares at [Root.Monarch.GetName], its back home to a buzzing hive of bloodflies, much less aggressive now, although still a common nuisance.\n\nFinally, the Matriarch is in sight. Tall as the tallest mountains, its roots and branches twisting in impossible patters, its bark scarred from years of torture. Yet now it flowers and gives fruit. Its wounds, which once festered and spread rot and bile across the land, now show signs of healing. [Root.Monarch.GetName] reaches the foot of the World Tree, something that was once impossible to do without getting torn to pieces by the undead vegetation it conjured as desperate defenses. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] puts a hand in its bark, and feels the subtle tremble of the fathomless energy within. It beats, like a colossal heart, one which once rotted and now blooms. And from the depths of the tree, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can almost hear the voice of Lama Kerac, the old suffering queen that now can rest easier, the curse brought by her folly soon to be completely undone thanks to the relentless fight of humankind against the dark and evil of the hags. And she says thank you."
noukahi_pantheon.10.a:0 "To fight against the dark in any shape it takes, that’s our duty!"

noukahi_pantheon.11.t:0 "Kheterat at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.11.d:0 "The pilgrimages of the Noukahi natives always seemed like a primitive and barbaric practice to [Root.Monarch.GetName], a senseless and wasteful trek full of risks and absurd trials, just to see the huts that house their false idols. However, for as long as the Compromise lasted, some semblance of respect, even if undeserved, must be feigned, as infuriating as that was. But the Medaka would never stoop so low as to pretend to believe in the repulsive gods of the Noukahi Pantheon. Instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] opted to visit a truly holy site, the great Kheterat, heartland of Halann’s first and most glorious empire, resting place of the divine Elikhet and the home of the Stewardship.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt almost like a child in a toymaker workshop, practically giggling with excitement as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] traversed the streets of the great city. What a delight, to leave those backwards, uncivilized plains and visit the true and only heart of civilization in Halann. To see the waters of the Mother’s Sorrow, calmly passing through the city, and the divine Khet, enjoying a well deserved rest at the shore of the river they so lovingly kept and maintained, as some lucky servants tended to their every need. In the distance, one could see the colossal pyramid that served as resting place for the Great Elikhet. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could spend all day simply gazing at its magnificence.\n\nBut first, some business. The actual reason for this journey awaited. To speak with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] contacts, to secure purses, swords and feathers that could accompany [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] retinue back to Horashesh. Securing reelection was never easy, never guaranteed. But with this, it would be easier. With this, perhaps, it would take less time for Horashesh to abandon its barbarism and ignominy, to leave Noukahi, to rid itself of the Efergezmu and the false idols, to ascend to something closer to this divine city [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] so loved."
noukahi_pantheon.11.a:0 "Horashesh will be Khetist!"

noukahi_pantheon.12.t:0 "Jezarpizu at Last!"
noukahi_pantheon.12.d:0 "The faces of old kings past stare at [Root.Monarch.GetName] as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ascends towards the heights of the Emot Nepas Sedar. A particularly inebriated harpy at the mountain’s foot offers to take [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] flying upwards, although it seems like less of a transportation offer and more of an indecent proposal. Regardless, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gently rejects their offer, as the challenge of the climb is as much a part of the pilgrimage as the travel itself.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ascends, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] passes through more and more faces, first those of the Mezhi of Irkan Eparta, from the most forgettable petty chief to the greatest kings of the land. Then, at a height where the air gets thin and the city of Jezarpizu resembles an anthill from above, the faces take on new features. These are the faces of the harpy matriarchs of the Naléni flock. In a way, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is walking through the carved history of Telekenid. Ascend a bit more, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would find [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the harpies’ roosts, but that’s not [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] destination.\n\nA natural balcony separates from the path, a small shrine in it. As the Griots sing, it is here that Nzeri rescued her husband from the kidnapping harpy Nalayni. This is a shrine to unyielding love, but also to honour, pride and determination. Standing in the cliff, inches away from the sky, [Root.Monarch.GetName] screams at the heavens, and proclaims [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] love, burning and unending. Love for the one that awaits [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] at home? For [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] kingdom? For something, or someone, else? That remains a secret between [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and the Gods, as the proclamation dissipates into the sky. But there is one thing that all know. The ties of love proclaimed above these mountains cannot be broken, they are as eternal and enduring as the faces that adorn the sides of the cliffs."

noukahi_pantheon.100.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] travels in pilgrimage with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue, they come across a patch of desolate land, the fields barren and dry, the rotten carcasses of cattle littering the fields. The nearest village does not look much better, its almost skeletal inhabitants quickly flocking towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] enters the town. “Please, good pilgrims, show these sinners mercy - could you spare some of your water so we can quench our thirst?” Upon questioning, the desperate supplicants soon reveal the reason for their sorry state. Months ago, the townspeople greedily denied water to a thirsty wandering Griot, who promised them they would have their cruelty returned thousandfold. Sure enough, all their wells soon ceased producing clean water, filling with a foul slime that killed plants and sickened those that drank it.\n\nA Griot in the retinue points out the punishment is fair, and the villagers should resign themselves to pray, offer sacrifices and ask for forgiveness until the Gods grant it. The villagers meekly agree, but beg for some water to quench their thirst and make their penitence easier, as they fear they might not live enough to ever be granted forgiveness otherwise. [Root.Monarch.GetName] checks the water containers. There is enough to grant the penitents' request, but it would require purchasing more in the next stop, an unaccounted expense."

Thus, when [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s retinue meets an enthusiastic young warrior in the road, it raises worries among some of the most seasoned pilgrims. The boy seeks to prove his worth by vanquishing a recently emerged juvenile Serpopard, before it can grow in power and threaten the nearby villages. However, being clearly inexperienced and poorly prepared, he could very well end up being the cause of that threat he is worried about.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] considers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] options. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could just leave the warrior to try and prove himself on his own, but to send additional swords to ensure beyond doubt that the threat is vanquished would be greatly virtuous, and the youth would surely be thankful for the support. On the other hand, the boy shows great potential, and perhaps he could be convinced to abandon his altruist cause and seek a comfortable position in [Root.GetName]’s armies.

All I ask in exchange, some mere bread crumbs, some minute amount of gold to feed my poor starving family. Surely a great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] such as you would have no issue sparing those few coins in exchange for the spear of a true hero?“\n\nThe traveling merchant that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has met during [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pilgrimage has been showering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with similar speeches for hours already.

The guide, however, spits on the ground. "These bastards were good for nothing but robbing and killing in life - at least in death they serve as food for the vultures. I feel more sorry for the horses than for these sorry excuses for men." Most of the pilgrimage retinue seem to be in agreement. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows what the Griots teach, that even the lowest of scum deserves a proper burial, so that their soul can reach the afterlife and be properly judged.
