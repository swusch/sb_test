 ung_ready_to_die_title:0 "Ready To Die"
 ung_ready_to_die_desc:0 "The beating of drums echoes throughout our realm. Thousands of orcs have lined up to join our army. They are prepared, carrying family heirlooms and weapons. Who are we to deny them their right to die for their homeland?\n\nFurther afield are the humans in Inner Castanor. They think they can stop our armies with their groups of violent adventurers. Let them come! They shall be ready to die, for no one can stand against the might of orcs!"

 ung_safe_and_sound_title:0 "Safe and Sound"
 ung_safe_and_sound_desc:0 "The White Walls of Castanor are a sight to behold. The walls rise more than three orcs tall and cover almost our entire country. Within these walls was the heartland of the old Castanorian Empire. It was with these walls that Castellyr survived as Count’s League until we conquered them. The most incredible part is that other than a few breaches, it is mostly usable. Should we rebuild some portions of the wall and fortify them along with the ancient North Citadel, we could ensure that no one would invade us. The Walls must be rebuilt if we are to be safe and sound."

 ung_swords_to_plowshares_title:0 "Swords to Plowshares"
 ung_swords_to_plowshares_desc:0 "We own all the land in the heart of old Castanor. While some may say “We do not sow”, we are not those orcs. It is time for our warriors to return home and till the ground. This was what we fought for. We did not fight for Korgus and especially did not fight just to fight. We fought for a land that we may settle down and live in, outside of the nightmare that was the Serpentspine. We must trade our swords for plowshares and start our new farms. Through the harvests, a new orcish people will rise."

 ung_black_sheep_title:0 "Black Sheep"
 ung_black_sheep_desc:0 "Unlike our southern kin, our western kin is hardy and warlike. The orcs in the west have been known to use the Greatwoods and swamps around Balmire to ambush humans and raid them. The western orcs are among the most devout Dookanists and see those in the east as traitors to Korgus’s legacy. While we firmly deny having the same aims as them, there could be something to learn from the black sheep of the Escanni orcs. We could either learn to embody their attributes, training to be fearless warriors, or we could rely on our own methods and keep a diplomatic outlook on Escann."

 ung_issue_of_slavery_title:0 "Issue of Slavery"
 ung_issue_of_slavery_desc:0 "Orcs are no stranger to slavery. Goblins have been slaves to orcs for millennia. In fact, Severed Ear is notable due to expanding slavery to encompass other orcs as well. For many, slavery is a core tradition of the orcs as much as Ozarm’chadash or the clan structure. To many others, slavery is an abomination that can be clearly seen by the scores of orc refugees fleeing north. Tales of beatings, reprisals, and separation of family members travel through our realm. It is time that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a stance and tells the world how Unguldavor views slavery."

 ung_half_orc_identity_title:0 "Half-Orc Identity"
 ung_half_orc_identity_desc:0 "“We are a people without a place to call home or a future. Caught between two natures and belonging to neither.” Half-orcs are a depressing people. They have no place to call home, not national identity, and are treated poorly in most places. Even in Unguldavor, many half-orcs do not feel welcome in clan cities or human-dominated districts of major cities.\n\nWe should work to give an identity to the half-orcs of Unguldavor. They are heirs to the legacy of Arosha and Castanor and they should be proud of it. Lothane “Bluetusk” showed how half-orcs are as much a part of Escann as anyone else. Unguldavor does not discriminate. Half-orcs can embrace an Ungulan national identity just as the orcs have."

 ung_throne_of_empires_title:0 "Throne of Empires"
 ung_throne_of_empires_desc:0 "Castonath, once the city of world’s desire. Now, it is merely a massive ruin. As the last of the orc-eating patricians are captured, we need to solidify control of the city. Castonath is the jewel of Escann as was seen by all the adventurers trying to claim it before our conquest. We must gain control of Castonath if we are to control Escann. And with that, we need to determine if the patrician institution is worth saving or if it should have died with Castanor."

 ung_insecure_homeland_title:0 "Insecure Homeland"
 ung_insecure_homeland_desc:0 "In the lands of Unguldavor, not all places are majority orc. In many, remnants of adventurers make up the majority and have no loyalty to the nation. These present some internal challenges and sets Bloodgorger on edge.\n\nWe have therefore devised a plan. We will resettle some orcs into the human territories while sending some humans to majority orc cities. Through this, we could make all provinces of Unguldavor majority orc and therefore loyal. It is not a pretty solution, but it is a solution."
 ung_insecure_homeland_tooltip:0 "§MAll non-orc/non-half-orc provinces in Inner Castanor must have no separatism.§!\n."

 ung_liberation_force_title:0 "Liberation Force"
 ung_liberation_force_desc:0 "To the west lies the Greatwoods, Balmire, and Cursewoods. While not the best land of the west, it is where the orcs have managed to hold on in the face of human conquest. If we are to free our kin from Wyvernheart and Alenor, we need to build a liberation force. We cannot settle for an equally-sized army. We need to muster the greatest army Escann has ever seen since the end of the Greentide. It is time to rally the recruits and train the soldiers. We march to war!"

 ung_western_march_title:0 "Western March"
 ung_western_march_desc:0 "Our western lands are not exactly the best. Despite the nice farmlands in the areas of Silvervord and Adenica, most of the land controlled by us is some haunted forests and a desolate swamp. Furthermore, the expansion has overextended our realm. It is probably for the best that we hand off the realm to a march, Khozrugan, to handle the administration of the west and muster a large army for us."

 ung_first_clan_council_title:0 "First Clan Council"
 ung_first_clan_council_desc:0 "For our entire history, orcs have almost never been united. Our tribalism always led to clans fighting each other more than others. Even while in the Serpentspine, orcs fought other orcs more than the dwarves. It was only with Korgus Dookanson that the orcs united, only to fall once he died.\n\nHowever, not all is lost. Arosha Oakbreaker, companion of Corin and a venerable old orc nowadays, has come up with a brilliant idea. Instead of unity based on a person, such as either Korgus or herself, unity should be achieved through clans cooperating to bring Escann to prosperity. While not a new idea, perhaps this unity would last longer than one lifetime."
 ung_inherit_limit:0 "§GIf any clan has more than 10 provinces in Inner Castanor, they will refuse to join us.§!\n."

 ung_our_place_in_escann_title:0 "Our Place in Escann"
 ung_our_place_in_escann_desc:0 "Who are we and what is our purpose? Ever since the Greentide, our international reputation has not been great. Are we invaders set on conquering the continent, or merely a people looking for a new home? Many humans, such as those in Marrhold, Esthil, and Rosande, see us as nothing more than monsters. This could not be further from the truth! We should spend some effort in clearing up some misconceptions, which should include deciding our diplomatic stance on conquest and our relation with humans."

 ung_new_clan_capitals_title:0 "New Clan Capitals"
 ung_new_clan_capitals_desc:0 "The transition from a tribal to a settled society is more of a process than a switch. Some of our clans, such as Clouded Eye and Severed Ear, seem to be transitioning quite well. Some, especially Dogeater, resent it and fight against the change. By building new clan capitals in the current tribal capitals, we can help them along with the process. By centralizing power in those cities and giving them the resources to properly run a state, the clans will modernize and help the running of our state.\n\nIt is time to start constructing the new capitals and ensure the loyalty of our clans."

 ung_proclaim_royal_cities_title:0 "Proclaim the Royal Cities"
 ung_proclaim_royal_cities_desc:0 "The clans have always been a pain to deal with. They argued all the time and at other times against their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The worst part was that they controlled most of the population. This had to be rectified. That was when the Royal Cities were discussed.\n\nThe Royal Cities would be a designation given to several cities across Unguldavor and had the following benefits: they would answer to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and not a chief. The children of city dwellers would be subjects of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] instead of a chief. Lastly, the cities would be allowed to flourish and innovate without being stifled.\n\nIt is time to proclaim the Royal Cities throughout Unguldavor and let them prosper."

 ung_unguldavor_academy_title:0 "Unguldavor Academy"
 ung_unguldavor_academy_desc:0 "It is a regrettable fact that most orcs are illiterate, including the chiefs. While [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] would love to build universities to advance Ungulan learning, it was clear the country was not ready for it. Instead, it would be through the children that education needed to start.\n\nCastonath will be prepared for the Unguldavor Academy, where children of chiefs, nobles, and the wealthy would gather to learn reading, math, and basic magic. In time, they would lead us into a golden age. Along with the academy, we could also decide a new name for the city at the heart of our realm."

 ung_breaking_point_title:0 "Breaking Point"
 ung_breaking_point_desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had enough! These clans have been undermining [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule for too long! Chief Borgu Severed Ear, chancellor of Unguldavor, has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a plan. Through this plan, all the clans will learn their place and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will have firm control over the control.\n\nThe process has already begun. Treaties are being rewritten and contracts changed. With Borgu ensuring the loyalty of the clans:\n\n§RThere is no way this can possibly go wrong!§!\n"

 ung_religious_divisions_title:0 "Religious Divisions"
 ung_religious_divisions_desc:0 "“Faith is the heart of a nation as culture is its soul.” That was a quote from Arosha that showcases the problem of our nation. If our heart is threatened, it would lead to the death of our nation. We need to insure religious unity, or all we have worked towards would amount to naught."

 ung_corin_v_korgus_title:0 "Corin vs. Korgus"
 ung_corin_v_korgus_desc:0 "A battle is occurring for the heart of Unguldavor. On one side is Corin, representing the ideals of fighting for justice and equality between man and orc. On the other side is Korgus, representing the ideals of strength and might makes right. Clouded Eye and Severed Ear follow Corin’s teachings, but Bloodgorger and Bladebreaker follow Korgus’s, seeing him as a martyr against the Cannorians whose gods imprisoned Dookan. Now is the time we make our stance. We must either all follow Corin or all follow Dookan."
 ung_corin_v_korgus_tooltip:0 "§GEvery province with a tax building will convert to our state religion.§!\n."

 ung_field_test_title:0 "A Field Test"
 ung_field_test_desc:0 "The alchemists in our realm have come forward with rumors of a new gunpowder recipe and cannonball. Apparently, the cannons would melt city walls and tear through enemy armies. While this sounds like a good idea, there needs to be somewhere to test these cannons so we know that it works. Fogwood seems like a good place to test. It is desolate and full of foothills, so hitting the mountains would not kill anyone. If this works, we will have an advantage over the others in Escann."

 ung_trying_transmutation_title:0 "Trying Transmutation"
 ung_trying_transmutation_desc:0 "Transmutation and alchemy share several similarities. Both have well-defined methods and both are key to an advancing society. Therefore, it is crucial that we begin to harness transmutation to improve our realm.\n\nWithin the woodland in the east, we could test our methods. Hardwood is becoming an important material in construction of weapons and buildings. Should we turn an entire forest into hardwood, we will have the materials to build up the whole of our realm."

 ung_improving_crop_title:0 "Improving Crop Yield"
 ung_improving_crop_desc:0 "The goods in our territory are poor. Grain and livestock may be essential to survive, but we produce more than enough to feed our people. The lands here have soil unsuitable for goods such as tea, coffee, or wine. However, with alchemy, nothing is set in stone. Our alchemists are hard at work making the soil more fertile and suitable for other crops. While we cannot make them grow tropical plants such as sugar or coffee, we can definitely make it suitable for more Damerian climate plants such as cotton, wine, and tobacco."

 ung_birth_of_alchemy_title:0 "Birth of Alchemy"
 ung_birth_of_alchemy_desc:0 "When one thinks of magic that orcs would practice, they would assume shamanry. However, in the woods of Unguldavor, there are many spots that provide both materials, reactants, and locations that are suitable for alchemical labs. We should allow some independent alchemists to build their mage tower in these woods. Perhaps we could derive some benefit from their innovations."

 ung_spine_brace_title:0 "Spine Brace"
 ung_spine_brace_desc:0 "The Serpentspine forms a natural barrier to the northeast of our nation. The mountains protect us from invasion by Grombar, but it is not a perfect barrier. Bladebreaker Pass and Dwarfhope both border our territory, allowing goblin, kobold, and black orc clans to raid our territory. Not only that, but on our doorstep is the hold of Khugdihr, allowing dwarves to launch an invasion on us if we are not careful. We must fortify this border. Khugsroad, Steelhyl, and Fogwood all need fortifications built to prevent the chaos of the Serpentspine from spilling into Unguldavor."

 ung_free_our_brothers_title:0 "Free Our Brothers"
 ung_free_our_brothers_desc:0 "To our south lies the most peaceful of our brethren. Represented by Heartgrinder, these orcs wish to lead peaceful lives on the farm as opposed to fighting wars. However, the south is not a place for the peaceful. The Shackle Kingdoms of Rosande and Marrhold loam there to take them in chains while Esthil seeks to kill them all. We must do something to save our kin, or they will suffer.\n\nBy striking an alliance with one of the clans, we can justify a war to reconquer land for our ally. If we cannot, then we could always just conquer some territory directly. The latter option is less preferable, but if we wait too long, we may have no other choice."

 ung_strengthen_alliance_title:0 "Strengthen Alliance"
 ung_strengthen_alliance_desc:0 "Our southern ally has proven themselves to be a great asset. Together, the humans know the orcs are here to stay in Escann. We have shown the world that orcs do more than wage war. Orcs can build and innovate. It is time to strengthen that alliance. From now on, there will be no Heartgrinder, or Deadfang, or Rotcleaver. Instead, just as the north consolidated into Unguldavor, the south will consolidate into Barumand. Together, we can achieve great things."

 ung_into_the_dark_title:0 "Into the Dark"
 ung_into_the_dark_desc:0 "The Serpentspine is our old home. While no Ungulan alive today has ever lived in the Serpentspine, the mountains are filled with riches as can be seen from the resurgent dwarf holds and the goblins there. We must claim the riches of the Serpentspine to advance our realm. The gold and gems will improve our coffers while the iron, copper, and even mithril will improve our weapons and tools. The riches of the Serpentspine will turn us from a backwater into the seat of power in Escann!"

 ung_reclaim_clan_land_title:0 "Reclaim Clan Land"
 ung_reclaim_clan_land_desc:0 "Even after the defeat of the rebellious clans, most of their lands are still de facto controlled by the chiefs and not the crown. This is unacceptable! We did not lose tens of thousands of soldiers just so the chiefs could keep their unwarranted control! Already, administrators are sent out and courthouses are being built in clan lands. As we do so, we can ensure the lands are under the watchful eye of the monarchs instead of the clans. With this, we will finally have a nation that functions and will not fall into civil war again."

 ung_more_than_allies_title:0 "More Than Allies"
 ung_more_than_allies_desc:0 "Barumand and Unguldavor have been allies for most of their histories. However, it feels as if Barumand is just one war away from being conquered at any moment. During the Unguldavori Civil War, many human kingdoms were close to declaring war on Barumand while our army was distracted putting down the rebellion. If Barumand is to be protected, it cannot be an independent nation.\n\nA new treaty is being drafted, one that will make Barumand an integral part of Unguldavor and the united orcish polity."

 ung_surpassing_old_title:0 "Surpassing the Old"
 ung_surpassing_old_desc:0 "Castanor was the strongest country in the history of Halann, at its height stretching across Cannor and even reaching into Bulwar. Only an alliance of all of Western Cannor and the elves could destroy it. Yet now, we have surpassed even Castanor in riches.\n\nThe lands of Unguldavor are rich and prosperous. In the fields, bountiful crop yields lead to a high population and a lack of malnutrition. In the woods, alchemists experiment and advance the realm with technology decades in the future. In the cities, riches flow from the trade to and from Escann. It is time we acknowledged our ascendance."

 ung_facing_the_abyss_title:0 "Facing the Abyss"
 ung_facing_the_abyss_desc:0 "The worst has happened. Unguldavor has fallen into civil war as clans wage war against the crown. King Grom has seized power to preserve what little hope we have left, but it is a losing battle. Already, Borgu Severed Ear, declaring himself King of Unguldavor, is leading his legion of fanatics and criminals towards Castonath as the other clans vie for independence. This is Unguldavor’s greatest hour. We cannot fall. We shall not fall! Our ancestors did not unite into Unguldavor only to see their descendants kill themselves in a pointless war!\n\nKing Grom has gathered generals and alchemists from across the realm to help him in this war. If we lose here, Unguldavor dies a dream. Should we lose, everything we have done has been for naught and we shall be cast aside as chaff in the wind. But if we survive and triumph, Unguldavor will stand strong, cleansed of all its failing organs and reborn into a beautiful nation for all Ungulans. §MThe time is now!§!\n"

 ung_dust_settles_title:0 "The Dust Settles"
 ung_dust_settles_desc:0 "The chaos of the past decade begins to settle. As rebellious clans fall, Unguldavor is healing from its wounds. Many clan orcs are beginning to rejoin the country, having only fought due to clan allegiance that no longer matters. A new Unguldavor rises from the ashes like a phoenix. Gone are the days of squabbling clans, worries of human disloyalty, and cycle of violence. The clans have been shown their place, the humans have displayed their loyalty to Unguldavor, and no more armies can be levied against the crown.\n\nKing Grom is leading Unguldavor to victory as not just a general, but as a statesman. Perhaps his administrative and diplomatic prowess is what makes him truly outstanding. The Unguldavor he is rebuilding is no longer a chaotic and wild confederation, but a federation united in its diversity. Perhaps he is truly §GGreat!§!\n."
 
 ung_new_capital_title:0 "A New Capital"
 ung_new_capital_desc:0 "The Unguldavori Civil War showed us the importance of a good capital. When the clans revolted, we were kicked out of our capital and had to rely on a Royal City to keep the royal family safe. Administration was in chaos until we reclaimed our old capital. But it also made clear that Royal Cities are perfectly suited for a capital.\n\nWe have many options for a new capital. North Citadel, former Castonath, Ardent Keep, Silvervord, and Ionntras all make great choices. Each has an advantage, but that is something to keep in mind. Our new capital shall be the grandest in Escann and reflect what Unguldavor aims to be."

 ung_fate_of_unguldavor_title:0 "Grom's Legacy"
 ung_fate_of_unguldavor_desc:0 "War is waged across Escann. Witch-kings plot in their towers how to subjugate more of Escann under their heels, slavers salivate at the thought of acquiring more of our kin, and rogue warlords dream of looting the entire subcontinent. To these forces, Unguldavor stands in opposition. In Unguldavor, orcs and humans live side-by-side while civilians are free to live their lives without oppression. Thanks to King Grom the Great, Unguldavor has been a nation of justice in an increasingly unjust world. It is time we stick to his legacy and carry the green banner forth.\n\nAs our armies march across the land, we remember King Grom’s favorite phrase: “A body needs both a heart and mind to live.”"
 ung_fate_of_unguldavor_tooltip:0 "Either the Escanni Wars of Consolidation have started or we have bypassed it."

 ung_fate_of_escann_title:0 "Fulfilling the Dream"
 ung_fate_of_escann_desc:0 "Kingdoms have fallen across Escann. The witch-kings of Esthil, the griffon riders of Marrhold, the plantation lords of Rosande, Silmunas of Rogieria, crusaders of Corintar and Ravenmarch are all now footnotes in history. Where once stood several different peoples, now only one nation stood: Unguldavor.\n\nFounded by a dream that Arosha Oakbreaker had, Unguldavor has shocked the world through its survival. Even as the Unguldavori Civil War threatened to kill the dream or twist it into a nightmare, it persevered. As Arosha dreamed of a world where orcs, humans, and half-orcs could live together while the orcs had a new homeland, we have fulfilled it and more.\n\nAs figures such as Griff the Younger, Varina, the Regent of Wyvernheart, Rogier “the Young Owl”, Lucian, and the Blacktowers become part of history books, figures such as Corin, Lothane “Bluetusk”, Arosha Oakbreaker, and King Grom the Great become icons of the Ungulan national identity.\n\nAnd in the heart of power in Castonath, a new legacy begs to be claimed. The name of Kaztubar."

 ung_mithril_hunt_title:0 "Mithril Hunt"
 ung_mithril_hunt_desc:0 "Mithril, the legendary metal only the dwarves knew how to forge. Mithril is superior to all other metals as clashes in the Serpentspine showed. Mountainshark has been a pain to fight with their mithril weapons and armor. However, if we could dominate the mithril trade, we would gain riches to rival old Damescrown.\n\nThe Ungulan Mining Company must gain control of Mithradium in order to dominate the mithril trade. Once that is the case, Unguldavor will rise ever higher."

 ung_stronger_than_steel_title:0 "Stronger Than Steel"
 ung_stronger_than_steel_desc:0 "When the cannonball melted Samûr’s cannon, he said he needed something stronger than steel. While mithril fits the specifications, it is too rare and has orders filled to make specialized tools with it. However, Samûr realized he could just transmute the properties of mithril to iron. Steelhyl has been left in disrepair ever since the mithril trade dominated Unguldavor. Perhaps to get iron suitable for cannons and bring wealth back to Steelhyl, the whole province could have alchemists transmute the iron into a stronger version of itself. While not as good as mithril, it is still very valuable."

 ung_samur_lab_complex_title:0 "Samûr’s Lab Complex"
 ung_samur_lab_complex_desc:0 "Samûr Ultanuhankar is perhaps the greatest alchemist of our age. When he was a young orc, he managed to solve math equations in Unguldavor Academy that the professors were struggling with. In adolescence, he marketed and sold his first potion to the world, earning untold riches. Even now, he is merely in his thirties and is already the richest orc in Unguldavor with international fame and acclaim. And all this was from a small laboratory at his childhood home.\n\nAs part of the deal to help during the Unguldavori Civil War, King Grom promised to build a lab complex in Esswyck for Samûr and other alchemists. Construction is underway ever since Clouded Eye was reincorporated and soon the benefits will reach our nation."

 ung_fixing_mistakes_title:0 "Fixing Mistakes"
 ung_fixing_mistakes_desc:0 "Samûr has taken special interest in the early experiments with gunpowder and cannonballs. In his opinion, the issue with the old recipe was making the cannonballs too explosive instead of improving the power of the gunpowder. He has already written up equations and sent his apprentices to experiment on some new mixtures to improve the flawed recipe. He feels that he is reaching a breakthrough to finally get rid of the danger of the experimental cannonballs."

 ung_ungulan_alchemy_title:0 "Ungulan Alchemy"
 ung_ungulan_alchemy_desc:0 "In Unguldavor, alchemists are free to experiment with different types of experiments and magics. In particular, the alchemists in Unguldavor have started to experiment with artificery. This new study, learned from the gnomes and goblins, has taken off among the universities and labs across the nation. While some citizens have raised concerns about Ravelian Society conspiracies, they have been safely brushed aside as they are not the predominant artificers. Instead, these alchemists and artificers are seemingly in step with each other.\n\nShould we accept the artificers as equals to the mages or even give them preferential status? Either way, alchemists are sure to play a key role in the future."

 flavor_unguldavor.1.t:0 "The First Clan Council"
 flavor_unguldavor.1.d:0 "In a newly rebuilt amphitheater in [Root.Capital.GetName], leaders of the different clans have shown up. The various chiefs were arrayed on dining chairs surrounding a kitchen table from a nearby inn. While shabby, history was about to be made on [GetDate].\n\nArosha Oakbreaker, an elderly orc now, approached the group and took a seat at the head table. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] bowed respectfully and took the seat next to hers. Arosha cleared her throat and announced, “We are gathered here today to discuss the survival of orckind in a post-Greentide world. As we have seen in the west and south, our fellow orcs are being conquered and enslaved by the adventurers. While some orcs may see their future in full-hearted adopting all Cannorian customs and others may see it in dedicating themselves to conquest, we believe in a different path.”\n\nThe chiefains leaned in to hear what Arosha had to say next. Arosha continued, “For a long time, we have fought each other as much as we fought the adventurers. Severed Ear and Bloodgorger, Clouded Eye and Bladebreaker. However, we cannot survive like this. Though Corintar holds back some enemies, what would happen if Rosande takes them over? These things are not unheard of, like how the Anbenncost Expedition was conquered by those demon worshipping elves before the Battle of Castonath. If Rosande was to conquer us, they’d take us all in chains to work in their fields until our descendants drop dead.”\n\n“That’s why I am proposing a new nation: Unguldavor, Wall of Forests. Just like a forest is made up of several trees to make a strong wall, Unguldavor is composed of several clans. Individually, we are weak, but together, we are strong. It is, henceforth, with great honor that I bestow the title of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Long may [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] reign!”\n\nAll the chieftains rose up and applauded. The terms were then laid out: every clan would be autonomous, answering only to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for peace and defense of the realm. Every chieftain signed their name on the Unguldavor Charter. History would remember this day, but if it is for fame or for ruin is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to find out."

 flavor_unguldavor.2.t:0 "Place of Patricians"
 flavor_unguldavor.2.d:0 "Since the founding of Castonath by Castan the Progenitor, the patricians were the true rulers of the city. As Castanor became the empire it is remembered for today, the patricians grew wealthier, often being richer than most kings. During the era of Chivalric Escann, the king of Castellyr often took orders from the patricians instead of the other way around. Even during the Greentide, the patricians managed to hold out in their forts, sending the commoners of the city to defend them and eat our brethren.\n\nNow, the patricians are at our mercy. The decision is not whether to punish or spare the patricians, for they’re all definitely guilty of eating orcs and undermining our authority. No, the decision is whether to do away with patricians entirely or to replace them with new patricians.\n\nThe suggestion came from Nâzu of Cancered. He argued that the patricians helped with governing a city as massive as Castonath, which had at its peak as many people as several kingdoms. He said that the true problem wasn’t the idea of patricians, but that the patricians became greedy and sought to undermine the authority of their emperors. In his plan, notable orcs, half-orcs, and even some humans would be made into patricians and trained to pick up the tasks required by the kingdom.\n\nAs expected, the current patricians were sabotaging their duties so any replacements would have to first clean the mess they made.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked at Nâzu and said:"

 flavor_unguldavor.3.t:0 "Friend or Foe"
 flavor_unguldavor.3.d:0 "Diplomacy is an art. One syllable could mean the difference between war and peace. Traditionally, orcish diplomacy was straightforward. If a clan disliked another or wanted what the other had, they declared war. If several clans saw a mutual threat, they’d ally together and take it down. In cases where it was suspected someone was lying, an Ozarm’chadash would be held to determine who was telling the truth.\n\nHowever, humans were different. They would cover their intentions with flowery words to hide them and backstab their allies if it was advantageous. Of course, honorable orcs such as ourselves would never do such a thing, but it was so.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was sitting on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, watching as two emissaries argue over which new approach to diplomacy should be taken.\n\nOne of them, Golm, looked at the other and said, “Ahe, you must realize that the point of diplomacy is to convince everyone you are on their side when, in truth, your nation is only in it for itself.”\n\nAhe, the other, crossed her arms and replied, “Golm, what is more important than reassuring words and lies is getting the point across. If we were to declare war on Marrhold and claim it was to keep the peace, no one would really believe it. However, if we justify our gains during the war, we would be seen more positively than if we told a complete lie.”\n\nGolm looks at [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and asks, “My liege, what do you think?”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood up and said:"

Among the humans and half-orcs, Corin remains their goddess as attempts to introduce Dookan to them have failed. Ever more, the clans of Clouded Eye and Severed Ear have both turned away from Dookan to worship Corin as their goddess, with the new Oakbreaker coat of arms using Corin’s shield. The clans of Bloodgorger and Bladebreaker, on the other hand, have remained steadfast in their worship of Dookan and keeping Korgus’s legacy alive.\n\nIt seems as if the battle between Corin and Korgus has never ended. Every month, some zealot of either Corin or Korgus conducts an attack on the other. The Fists of Dookan would burn down Regent Court temples dedicated to the redheaded goddess while the New Corin’s Circle would assassinate orcs critical of Corin.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sent out the decree to preach tolerance and proselytize the [Religion.GetName] faith, it was clear [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had a lot of work to do.

They had proper streets now, though mostly repaired Castellyrian roads. The crumbling walls and buildings were disassembled and used to build new walls and structures.\n\nIn Westgate, the new clan capital was rebuilt to have the White Walls act as the western city wall. Merchant caravans traveled on new brick roads through the gate, paying an adequate toll. In the middle of the city, a manor belonging to the chief of Severed Ear stood. The chief gave us a nod as he entered his home.\n\nIn Elderlan, farms stretched as far as the eye could see surrounding the city. Trees lined the roads as an iron statue of Korgus Dookanson stood in the center of the city. A training field stood outside the walls, where warriors flocked to be trained in the Badram Turyul, or berserker way. While the Bloodgorger chief was suspicious of our intentions, he didn’t stop us from building.\n\nIn Gulenhyl, the Royal Mints were now in the heart of the city. Armored carriages were often seen carrying coins from the mints to the rest of the kingdom. In the main plaza in front of the manor, a golden statue of Arosha Oakbreaker stood atop a fountain. Mother Arosha was the heart of Unguldavor, and we wouldn’t be here without her. The current Clouded Eye chief greeted [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] warmly and invited [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to the manor for dinner, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] politely refused.\n\nIn Steelhyl, the city walls and roads were reinforced with iron. Every day, weapons and armor would be sold to caravans from across Escann, making Steelhyl one of the richest cities in Unguldavor. The chief of Bladebreaker’s manor sat atop a hill overlooking the city. The chief was glad to have our investments in his city, but was stoic enough to not let it show.\n\nIn Dogwood, all [Root.Monarch.GetName] could say was [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tried. The city itself was unique as it was constructed out of hardwood covered in coating to keep the wood from rotting or burning. It was a beautiful city. The only issue was that the chiefess of Dogeater hated it. She took her loyalists and left, leaving it mostly abandoned.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat in the palace in [Root.Capital.GetName], one thought rose above the rest."

If we were to position our diplomacy correctly, we could justify all lands owned by [enemy_country.GetName] with oppressed orc populations being rightfully part of [ally_country.GetName].\n\nAlternatively, we could just lay claim to a vast swath of the south. These claims are, of course, extremely tenuous. However, it would give us land to cede to a southern vassal that would answer to us.\n\nThe choice is ours now.

Fortunately for him, a crowd started forming, composed of clanless orcs, half-orcs, humans, and dwarves.\n\nThe herald opened his scroll and announced, “By the order of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] Royal Majesty, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], a new legal jurisdiction is to be put forth! These are to be known as Royal Cities! A Royal City answers to no clan, but directly to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and has special privileges. Anyone who lives in a Royal City for two years and has a respectable job is to have their clan allegiance removed and answer only to the mayor and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Citizens of the Royal Cities will only pay taxes to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the city, not to their clans of birth!”\n\nMeanwhile, in the city of Ardent Keep, another herald gave her message. “By the order of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], Ardent Keep is to be a Royal City! Rejoice, for your city is one of a select few granted these rights!”\n\nIn Castonath, Ardent Keep, Southgate, Escerton, and Sapphirewatch, people cheered and immediately got in line to apply for citizenship. Commerce centered in the Royal Cities as traders had to only pay one tariff instead of two.\n\nIn the royal palace, however, the scene was much different. Several chiefs were seated in the council room and were shouting over each other. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] took a deep breath before taking a seat.\n\nChiefess Khaara Severed Ear was the first to stand up and shout, “You bastard! You stole our clansmen from us! You built us these nice cities, only to turn around and undercut us later! My father would be ashamed of you if he was still alive!”\n\nChieftess Uroph Dogeater stood up next and shouted, “You’re weakening our people! Us Dogeaters lived for generations roaming and fighting, being proud Ozdan and joining the army! But then you came along with your brilliant idea and have been filling our children’s minds with this Dargom nonsense!”\n\nThe other chiefs took their turns shouting and complaining. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sighed and sat down in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat, graciously accepting the grog from a human maidservant."

The forest canopy blocked out the sun while hills softly rolled by the mountains. It was lightly populated as well, which was exactly the reason why Unguladavor was testing the new cannonballs there.\n\nA bombard and a culverin were set up on one hill and were pointed to a hill across from it. On the opposite hill, several straw targets were set up to test the accuracy and strength of the cannons.\n\nA cart was pulled in by wargs containing several cannonballs. The cannonballs were covered in a white dust and glowed a faint blue color. The rider dismounted his warg and explained, “Be careful with those! That dust is the only thing that kept them from exploding when I hit a bump in the road.”\n\nOne orc picked up a cannonball and wiped off the dust before placing it in the bombard. Another filled the chamber with gunpowder before stepping back. Both stood at the side of the cannon when they lit the wick. Everyone backed up before covering their ears.\n\nThe sound of thunder erupted from the cannon, as loud as thunder striking nearby. Once the dust cleared and the orcs' ears stopped ringing, they looked and noticed that the cannon was now gone, leaving only melted steel in its wake. The other hill, however, was in even worse shape. Captain Flak Clouded Eye wasn’t so concerned about the cannon as he was about the forest fire that had started to spread all across the hill.\n\nAfter weeks of fighting the forest fire that refused to die and the death of ten orcs, it was clear that though the experimental cannonballs were powerful, they were completely impractical for military use as an attack on a position would literally erase it."

In peace and civilization, we found that our culture could adapt. Ozarm’chadash has become more of a merit test than a death battle. Shamans have become teachers and educators, teaching children across the country.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, the orcs there have evolved our culture in a different direction. While we and the southern orcs softened a little as not all of us have to be warriors, the western orcs are hardy folks. They are experts in traversing the Greatwoods, fighting monsters who don’t cross the White Walls. They are warriors and have mastered the warrior spirit, leading foolhardy charges against the encroaching humans.\n\nThere is much that could be learned from the Rugan orcs. We could hone their ferocity and emulate their ways to become true to our heritage. Such practice would improve our will to fight, but would earn the ire of humans. Alternatively, we could make them the Black Sheep of the orcs, not like their peaceful eastern kin.\n\nThe decision is now before us. Do we try to become more like them, or distance ourselves?"

 flavor_unguldavor.10.d:0 "In the newly opened Unguldavor Academy in the heart of the ancient city, a class was being held. The children of various chiefs, nobles, and wealthy members of society were all seated facing the board at the front. The teacher was an elderly orc woman with a stern look on her face.\n\n“As you can see class, Unguldavor was founded in the year 1494 A.A. by Arosha Oakbreaker, who brought together the various clans to form our nation. The clans of Severed Ear, Dogeater, Bloodgorger, Bladebreaker, and Clouded Eye make up our great nation. We secured a home that the adventurers cannot take from us,” the teacher said as she pointed towards a chart she set up on the wall. She looked at the students and asked, “Now, how many of you have completed the reading assignment I gave you?”\n\nOnly three students raised their hands. One student, a lanky half-orc boy, scratched the back of his head and said, “My warg ate my assignment.”\n\nThe teacher glared at him and asked, “Your parents let you close enough to their warg that it ate your assignment and yet did not eat you? And it is not that you just did not read because they have not learned?”\n\nHe chuckled nervously and replied, “You see…”\n\nShe slammed her desk and said, “Your parents paid good money to send you to this school. Unguldavor Academy was built to raise the next generation of alchemists, mages, and engineers by teaching the fundamental skills for a future university. Your grandfather did not sleep on the dirt or fight the humans out of love for Korgus. He fought to give you a future where you did not have to fight! If he did not do that, we would be stuck in the far eastern fringes of Escann, only surviving due to the woods keeping the human kingdoms out!”\n\nThe class was silent for a moment. Then a young orc girl raised her hand and asked, “Can I use the bathroom?”\n\nThe teacher looked at her. “I don’t know. Can you?”\n\nThe girl lowered her hand. The teacher then faced the class. “As I was saying, when it came to naming the city, we decided…"

 flavor_unguldavor.11.t:0 "Ungulan Slavery"
 flavor_unguldavor.11.d:0 "Slavery. It has been a feature of orcish society for millennia. Since the dawn of our kin, we have had goblin slaves who did all the tasks we did not want to. Goblins farmed our crops, cleaned our camps, and served as fodder for our armies. Orcs who fell into debt or wronged someone were often sentenced to slavery to pay off their dues. And as we entered Escann, some orcs started to enslave humans.\n\nHowever, it seemed as if we were not alone in slavery, for the humans have enslaved defeated orcs in mass. Nations such as Rosande own humongous plantations worked on by thousands of orc slaves. Luciande dominates the slave trade to Aelantir while Esthil tries to murder every orc they can find.\n\nA moral dilemma has been raised in [Root.Capital.GetName]. To many, slavery is a way of life and has been since the dawn of time. The strong take from the weak and that’s how things are. However, a growing movement has emerged. As escaped orc slaves have entered Unguldavor and spread their stories, many are shocked and horrified. Scars and bruises are displayed showing the horrors of slavery, with many hearing about families torn apart during auctions. Many, especially devout Corinites, believe slavery to be fundamentally evil and anathema to everything they believe in. In their eyes, no orc, half-orc, human, or even goblin should be enslaved as it steals their fundamental right to fight for righteousness.\n\nThere is also an economic element to it. While the nobility and aristocrats get wealthy off plantations, said wealth does not reenter the economy as slaves do not pay taxes nor spend money. There is no drive to innovate when a slave owner can just buy more slaves. This is the view of a revolutionary new economist, Shador Skullcrusher. He suggests that competition between economic actors on the free market over labor leads to higher wages and more economic activity. His analysis is viewed with suspicion, but perhaps it could be used to weaken the power of the clans, many of whom practice slavery.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors and says when asked about slavery:"

 flavor_unguldavor.12.d:0 "Alchemists from across Unguldavor gathered in [whoops_province.GetName] to begin the ritual. Mage towers had shamans atop them, guiding their spells towards the area. Apprentices created a circle of chalk around the province. As the sun reached its apex in the sky, that was when the spells were fired. If all went well, the trees would be transformed into hardwood trees.\n\nAt first, it looked promising. The trees were hardening and it looked like the spell would be a success. But then the trees exploded, filling the air with a cloud of sawdust so dense no one could see a thing. When the dust cleared, it was fortunate that no one was killed but something else happened. The trees were gone.\n\nThe area in the chalk circle was completely barren, with only dirt and sawdust on the ground. It seemed as if the spell was a total loss. That was when a pleasing scent arose.\n\nRemarkably, some flowers survived the explosion and gave off an aromatic scent. One of the shamans, who showed up as quickly as he could, bent down and sniffed the air. “I know what this is. This is the weeping lily, an extremely rare flower that can be used in some rituals.”\n\nAfter that day, weeping lilies spread across the new field to cover it since no other plant seemed to survive in the circle."

These dark caves were the home of our ancestors and where they spent their entire lives. Yet to us, it was clear they were inhospitable. How our ancestors dealt with living in complete darkness and cramped quarters would remain a mystery to us.\n\nAs the colonists convened in Asra Depths, it became clear that this was not sustainable. Colonists were returning home en masse with entire villages packing up and leaving back to the hills. Some unfortunate orcs even went mad, attacking their fellow colonists. As it stood, unless we came up with a plan, the Serpentspine colonies were doomed to collapse.\n\nCaptain Drok, a seasoned old orc who remembered fighting under Arosha, looked around and said, “When we first returned to the Serpentspine, I expected that we lost the ability to live here. I was right. However, we aren’t the only residents here.\n\n“Take the dwarves for example. Several dwarves have been in our country since the fall of Hammerhome. The dwarves are naturally adapted to living underground. If we send them to colonize the Serpentspine for us, they’ll both be glad to have a place to live and we’ll get the riches of their endeavor.”\n\n“What about our kin, the black orcs?” asked one of the other colony leaders. “Even though we dominated the caverns, many still live in our realm and it’d help us with legitimizing ourselves as the protectors of orckind if we gave them control of the colony.”\n\n“And what of the cave goblins?” asked another colony leader. “Like the dwarves, they are native to these caverns and know how to use those holds like Khugdihr. If we give them a colony to run, we could also repatriate any goblin in Unguldavor proper to the colonies to aid the effort.”\n\n…\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] received the transcript of the meeting and had to make a decision.

In the southwest, technically not a part of the Greatwoods, was the Cursewood. The Cursewood was once the sight of a human kingdom that was cursed, making the woods deadly to humans. In these environments, humans struggled and orcs only did marginally better. But that marginal difference made some of the toughest orcs in Escann.\n\nAs Unguldavor solidified control of the Greatwoods in Escann along with its borders with Gawed and Ibevar, it became clear that the orcs here would have something to say about it. Controlling the Greatwoods would expend a lot of manpower and bureaucratic capabilities. Along with that, many Ungulans didn’t feel like living in these accursed woods.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked over the information and started thinking. The hardy western orcs, whom Unguldavor assumed control over, seemed like a good candidate to hand control over to. Granted, there was always the risk that they would turn their warlike nature against Unguldavor and march on [Root.Capital.GetName]. That was why the March of Khozrugan was going to have some safeguards. Instead of a Rugan duke, an Ungulan governor would be assigned over the territories along with being the only person in Khozrugan who could raise an army. Local viceroys would be assigned to overlook different areas to ensure the needs of the locals were attended to.\n\nAs the Khozrugan March was being finalized, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was pleased with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self over what was done.

They are not welcome anywhere they go. Among human realms, they are seen as little better than orcs and as mistakes by most. Among orc realms, they are seen as useful but untrustworthy. The life of a half-orc is a harsh one, with the only decent realms for them still standing being Rogieria, Corintar, and Stalbor.\n\nHowever, two realms have a different relation with half-orcs. While Grombar became half-orc in the majority of its population on purpose, Unguldavor instead has a large half-orc minority rivaling the human minority in size. In many ways, the half-orcs have become their own people as they often marry other half-orcs of their own volition. In cities such as [Root.Capital.GetName], half-orcs make up a good portion of the merchants and bureaucrats. As they are at least tolerated in enough realms both human and orcish, they are able to travel and sell goods between them.\n\nAs the orcs in Unguldavor have finally gathered a national identity as Ungulan orcs, so too have the half-orcs. For many half-orcs, Unguldavor is their home and they love it. As the shamans teach children in various villages, they talk about how the half-orcs are children of two legacies: Castanor and the Arosha Oakbreaker. They are taught to take pride in both as Castanor was the pinnacle of civilization while Arosha Oakbreaker showed the orcs how to develop their own identity without falling into softness or savagery.\n\nAs such, a new Ungulan Half-Orc identity has emerged. These half-orcs see themselves as citizens of Unguldavor and as much a part of it as Ungulan orcs. As time goes one, perhaps the Unguldavori nation will never perish from Halann."

The forces of Severed Ear, Bloodgorger, Bladebreaker, Dogeater, and Clouded Eye outnumbered his 2-to-1 even with Khozrugan and Barumand coming to his aid. In the terms of his favorite board game, Urath, he had only two commanders and a king against five generals. If he was to win, he needed to gain more pieces and knock out his opponents’.\n\nAs he was deep in thought of different strategies, the throne room doors opened to reveal two figures, one tall and one muscular. The tall one bowed and said with casual ease, “[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom, I presume. I would like to introduce myself. I am Samûr Ultanuhankar, top of my class from Arosha University and descendant of goldsmiths that used to live in [871.GetName]. You may recognize me as the famous alchemist that was able to turn some lead into gold and solved Vincen’s Equation. I think I found out a way to melt castle walls by modifying the recipe for gunpowder. It is not cheap, but I am willing to give you some free shipments in return for promising to build a lab for me in [880.GetName].”\n\nThe muscular one strolled up and crossed his arms. “Commander Krûk Skullcrusher, leader of the Battle of [865.GetName]. I’m the innovator of the musket volley tactics you have seen come to use in the first battles of the war. I’m willing to serve you, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom looked at the two and nodded. He turned to Samûr. “You will receive your laboratory complex, sir.” He turned to Krûk. “And you will lead the armies.”\n\nAs the two got to work on their first tasks, a smile grew on Grom’s face. As war ravaged the country, he realized that this was not just a war to reconquer the country, but to also reform it to make it stronger and more fair."

 flavor_unguldavor.20.d:0 "In the ruined city of Durzobor, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom and his army had Borgu Severed Ear and his lackeys in chains. Humans and half-orcs from the traitor’s territory came out of hiding to look upon Grom, who had a very visible look of disgust on his face as he read through all that Borgu did. Borgu was blindfolded and had his hands cuffed behind his back.\n\nGrom faced the traitors. “We are gathered here today at the conclusion of Borgu’s rebellion. The charges against you are treason, slaughter of civilians, and unauthorized executions. The standard punishment for any of those crimes is death. What do you have to say for yourself?”\n\nBorgu chuckled. “Oh Grom, you naive fool. Do you really think Unguldavor would survive under your weak reign? Look at yourself! You are a lanky young orc who thinks that everyone can just coexist. I do not live in such a fantasy. Korgus knew it was unreasonable to expect to rule over Escann when we make up a minority. He drove them out of this land so we could have a home. And look where we were until his death. We ruled Escann, dominating every inch of it. But it was when his iron fist ended that we almost lost everything. Just because Unguldavor lived did not mean it was not next. This country has been rotting away since Arosha died. I had to lead us back into greatness!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom scowled. “No, Borgu, that was not what happened. Korgus corrupted our kind and made us into monsters. Should he have led a normal invasion instead of his massacre, we would not be enslaved on human plantations or lying in mass graves. Violence and cruelty only begets more violence and cruelty.” He darkly chuckled. “But I have to hand it to you for one analysis. Unguldavor has been rotting away since Arosha died. However, it was because of how decentralized it is. So I must thank you, for you resolved the clan problem by starting this civil war.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom faced the musketeers and said, “You may fire when ready.”\n\nGunshots rang across the city.

That is how many Dogeater warriors were killed in this last battle.”\n\nGrom stood over the bodies and asked, “Why so many? Why did they not just stop? They knew I was going to spare the soldiers.”\n\nKrûk sighed. “That was not doubted. Instead, it was just their way of life. They lived free or died. Those were the only ways. The surviving Dogeaters fled to the Greatwoods. It is somewhere they could roam free without being stopped.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom nodded. “I will not stop them. However, with Sarwood empty, that makes it perfect for the Stonecarvers to move in. There is something else on my mind though.” He looked back towards the west. “Ever since this war began, I believed that there was a better way to address the clans. Perhaps instead of several autonomous chiefs, we could instead take representatives from the clans to debate in a council to govern the country.”\n\nGrom looked at his notes. It would take some time to implement, but perhaps there was an alternative to this disaster. Perhaps the clans could be made into an asset instead of a liability."

The walls had long since fallen to cannons and the streets were empty as civilians fled the chaos of war. In the manor, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom faced the Bladebreaker chief and her family. Chief Atu Bladebreaker bowed and said, “My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I plead with you to spare my people. I led them into this rebellion, so I am the one who should be punished.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom nodded. “From this day forth, Atu and her family are to no longer hold any position of authority in Unguldavor.” He looked at the Bladebreaker POWs and added, “Along with that, it will now be illegal for any subject of Unguldavor to raise an independent army, save for Khozrugan, which is under direct Unguldavori control. All captured Bladebreaker soldiers are to turn in their weapons and vow to never take up arms again.”\n\nAs Bladebreaker soldiers handed over swords, muskets, and axes, Unguldavori soldiers seized control of the armory and arsenal in the city. The forges that belched smoke into the skies were now under national control.\n\nBladebreaker was one of the strongest clans in Escann, but now it has learned its place."

They adhered to orcish traditions without remaining stuck in them. They were a people of scholars and shamans. The first alchemists in Unguldavor often were from Clouded Eye’s territory. Hence why it was such a surprise they revolted.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom met with Khagor Clouded Eye in the manor to discuss peace terms. Grom looked at him and frowned. “Care to explain why you rebelled? There did not seem to be much for you to gain.”\n\nKhagor sighed and looked Grom in the eyes. “My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I did not have a choice. Borgu sent me an ultimatum that if I did not side with him and he won, my family and I would be executed. And since he had convinced every other clan to rebel, I did not believe you had a chance.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom steepled his fingers. “I cannot ignore that you rebelled against me. But on the other hand, you did not really intend to rebel and it was clear with how easy the battle was. So I will make you a deal. In return to remaining in charge of the Clouded Eye clan and retaining certain privileges, you must agree that you will defer to my authority and that you cede the ability to raise an army and mint currency to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty forever. Understood?”\n\nKhagor nodded. “Yes, my liege. I understand.”\n\n“Good, because if you did not, I would have to kill you.”"

Among the fallen was Ghorza Korgusblood, one of the few surviving descendants of Korgus, even if said descent was deeply in question. The war ended the very idea of Bloodgorger as all their warriors and leaders died attempting to defend it.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom marched into the city of Kalantardar with his army and looked around. Half-Orcs and humans were freed from their chains as the Colosseum of Kalantardar was forced to end battles to the death. In the center of town stood a statue of Korgus slaying the last Castellyrian king. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom looked at it in disgust. While the orcs did conquer the lands of former Castellyr, it was not retained through Korgus’s brutality and lies. It was through the wisdom and teachings of Arosha that Unguldavor survived. If Korgus’s ways truly worked, Venomtooth would not have been the first orcs to fall.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom stood in the center of town and faced the crowd. What few orcs remained in the city looked at Grom with distrust. He cleared his throat and announced, “People of Bloodgorger, it is over. The free reign to continue the most destructive of our traditions has come to an end. We shall make new traditions to replace the old! Ozarm’chadashes cannot end in bloodbaths anymore! Duels must be agreed upon by both participants, banning the lopsided duels versus slaves! And most of all, no more killings to restore honor!”\n\nSilence greeted [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Grom as he made his proclamation.

 flavor_unguldavor.25.d:0 "In the streets of old Castonath, crowds cheered as King Grom “the Great” marched down with his army. After almost a decade of war, Unguldavor was whole again. The old system of several petty clans dictating the actions of the state came to an end. Instead of a confederation of clans, Unguldavor was now a true nation with an identity and finally more unified than it was divided. The clans became more regional identities while humans now felt like equal members of our society.\n\nIn the front of the procession were two flag bearers carrying the banner of Unguldavor through the streets. The iconic green flag fluttered in the wind while soldiers blew on the horns behind them. Soldiers marched in formation as riders of both wargs and horses flanked the procession. In the middle was King Grom on his chariot being pulled by two Elikhander desertiers. He waved at the crowd with a smile on his face. These were his people. Despite the attempts of Borgu and his conspirators to destroy Unguldavor and take over the ashes, Unguldavor prevailed and emerged stronger than ever.\n\nOrcs, half-orcs, and humans were all gathered to cheer the victory in the Unguldavori Civil War. Though a hundred thousand died in the fighting on all sides, Unguldavor stood firmer than ever. With all the problems of the state solved, Unguldavor would always last in historical memory even if it fell one day.\n\nThe crowds saw their king and cheered. Many titles were thrown out. “Grom the Preserver!” “Grom the Magnificent!” “Grom the Great!” But perhaps the best one was the simplest. “Grom the Just.” To King Grom, what mattered most was not the glory or the adulation, but the mere satisfaction with bringing Unguldavor back together and ensuring justice and fairness for all.\n\nKing Grom reached the end of his procession and dismounted his chariot. He walked up the podium set up in the city’s massive plaza and raised his hands. The crowd quieted as he began his speech. “Countrymen, lend me your ears! The chaos that threatened to destroy our great nation has been crushed! Unguldavor lives and it will live on past all of us!” Cheers erupted from the crowd.\n\nAs the cheers died down, Grom continued, “We must remember that Unguldavor is more than its [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. It is all of us! From a mighty king to a lowly peasant, Unguldavor is what unites us and it is what makes us strong! And I have one more thing to say to you:”"

While some would argue for creating a capital from scratch, it would be inadvisable considering that we did not have the established state apparatus that made that decision worthwhile. Instead, we should move our capital to one of the major cities of the realm instead of a clan capital as was seen during the civil war.\n\nThe choices were as follows: North Citadel, Castonath, Ardent Keep, Silvervord, and Ionntras. North Citadel was the capital of former Castanor. Setting up our capital there would give us legitimacy as successors to that legacy, helping us govern large amounts of territory. Setting up our capital in Castonath would help us understand the needs of the Dargom in our territory. Setting up our capital in Ardent Keep was an odd option, but it had merits. Ardent Keep was still the strongest castle in Escann and would make our capital hard to capture in a war. Silvervord was connected to both Lake Silvermere and the Alen River, making it easy to use barges to trade with Cannor. Finally, there was Ionntras, which was the capital of Corintar. Whether we worship the goddess or Dookan, putting our capital in Corintar would convince our citizens of our religious superiority.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] desk and looked over the different plans.

If mixed correctly, the cannonballs would still explode on impact, but it would not create a fire that burnt down forests and caused excessive collateral damage.\n\nBy the end of the experiments, Samûr and his group set up a wall and the cannon to set up the test. As gunpowder and the cannonball were pushed into the cannon, Samûr smiled and stepped back. “Firing in ten, nine, eight…” Everyone backed up as he counted down. “Three, two.” Ears were covered as the wick was lit. “One!” Everyone ducked behind the barricade in case it blew up like the first iteration.\n\nBut it never happened. The cannon fired at a normal volume, with the cannonball hitting the wall before blowing up, causing it to be obliterated without too much excessive damage. Samûr uncovered his eyes and shouted, “Success! Now it is… Damn!”\n\nWhile the cannon did not explode, it did melt. The gunpowder was so hot that it melted the steel.

Our traditional reluctance towards most magic and technology was more about worrying about misuse and destroying our way of life. And as could be seen in the rest of Escann, that worry was not misfounded.\n\nEscann was filled with witch-kings. From Nurcestir to Esthil to Wyvernheart, witch-kings subjugated their populaces to torment and cruelty. In their hunger for power, they banned independent magic, fearing its threat to their power.\n\nIn Unguldavor, however, we feared no such magic. Alchemists, inventors, and other mages flooded our realm to experiment in our labs and teach in our universities. Along with this, a new field was burgeoning. Artificery. Combining magic and science, several alchemists have begun practicing artificery, making inventions that could turn the tide of war.\n\nAlready, our universities have become the best rounded education in Escann and lives have been improved.

Mage towers from across Unguldavor pulled magical energy from their provinces and aimed it at Steelhyl. Samûr knelt down on the hill and started chanting. Shamans directed their magical energy towards the hill as the other alchemists poured potions around the province.

Samûr stood at the side as it was prepared. The new iron from Steelhyl had many properties of mithril, but it was now time to test it. Samûr stepped back and let the cannon fire.\n\nThis time, the cannon did not melt. The shot was more accurate while still being destructive. Furthermore, it seemed like the recipe could be used with muskets as well. After all these years, it seemed that Unguldavor now had the perfect secret to use.

Instead of the standard return for a good harvest season, the numbers seemed around the amount collected during a drought with half the population. While unable to prove it, it was obvious that the Severed Ear lords had far more money than the measly amount we received."

 flavor_unguldavor.202.t:0 "Council Chambers Built"
 flavor_unguldavor.202.d:0 "The doors opened on the new council chambers in Lower Castonath for the Council of Clans. Already, representatives from the various clans along with representatives from the Royal Cities entered the chambers. The chambers had room for one hundred seats with five on the second floor to the right and five on the second floor to the left. The seats on the second floor to the right were reserved for the Clan Representatives of Clouded Eye, Bladebreaker, Dogeater, Bloodgorger, and Severed Ear. The five on the left were for Royal Representatives of Castonath, Ardent Keep, and the other cities.\n\nThe first matter of business was the election of a prime minister to consult with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the podium in the front and announced, “I am proud to be opening the new Council of Clans here in one of the oldest cities in the world. While some tried to destroy our nation, it is now alive and stronger than ever! And in order to hear the wishes of the people, this forum shall be used to address grievances and improve the lives of all citizens.”\n\nThe representatives cheered. It seemed as if the clan debate had reached its natural conclusion."
 flavor_unguldavor.202.a:0 "First order of business: coming up with insults to hurl."

 flavor_unguldavor.203.t:0 "New Traditions"
 flavor_unguldavor.203.d:0 "After ten long years, it was done. Where once Ozarm’chadashes left several leaders dead, now it was merely a test of competence that led to nepotism disappearing. Where once bold and pointless charges led to shocking defeats, now orcs fired in formation and were drilled to honor group cohesion.\n\nNew traditions replaced old ones all throughout Unguldavor. Traditions that harmed no one, such as venerating ancestors and warriors, were kept while destructive traditions were abolished. The result was a state suited for the modern world instead of being stuck in the past."
 flavor_unguldavor.203.a:0 "Shedding bad traditions doesn’t mean shedding orcishness."
