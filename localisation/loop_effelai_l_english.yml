  #Effelai Bloom Events
  effelai_bloom.322.t:0 "A question of Faith"
  effelai_bloom.322.d:0 "With the song learnt, many of the people of [Root.Country.GetName] have begun to agree with the ruinborn of the Effelai that this creature is not just a creature. It is a Goddess and the Ruinborn have worshipped them all of these years. There is increasing religious fervour and a growing desire amongst many for us to join the Ruinborn in her worship. \n\nToday a small group of native Ruinborn and [Root.Country.GetRacialCulture]s have come to speak with [Root.Monarch.GetName], bringing to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a question that will shape the nation for decades to come."
  effelai_bloom.322.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] brings the nation together in worshipping the Jungle Goddess."
  effelai_bloom.322.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] calls for the guards."
  effelai_bloom.323.t:0 "A question answered, a question gained."
  effelai_bloom.323.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] agreed with the assorted members of the group to follow the great Goddess of the Effelai. It was then that the different groups began to bicker amongst themselves, arguing over which specific methods of worship were right. [Root.Monarch.GetName] soon took charge of the situation as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] decided that the new faith of [Root.Country.GetName] would be:"

  effelai_bloom.323.b:0 "Senanset"
  effelai_bloom.323.c:0 "Chahinanito"
  effelai_bloom.324.t:0 "The Alianaíarat"
  effelai_bloom.324.d:0 "Our conversion to the veneration of the Goddess was a decision that has had great ramifications for all the people within our borders. The jungle is now integrated into our towns, our cities, our lives. There is not a single person unaffected by this decision and it has brought great boons to all of the residents of our jungles.\n\nThere are those amongst us that insist we should take things a step further and adopt a government predicated upon the rule of the Goddess; a theocracy. With it's primary goals being to preserve each being inside of the Effelai and to expand the influence of the Goddess across all of the Effelai and beyond.\n\nThere are others whoever that resist this, insisting that our [Root.Country.GovernmentName] is already perfectly suited to expand her influence without the need of any change.\n\n§RBeware!§b Becoming the Alianaiarat will lock you to mage only mode."
  effelai_bloom.324.a:0 "We must enact our Goddess' Alianaíarat"
  effelai_bloom.324.b:0 "The stability of [Root.Country.GovernmentName] is more important."
