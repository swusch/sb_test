#Accretive Path Events - By Bromar

accretive_path_events.1.t: "To Tend Another's Garden"
accretive_path_events.1.d: "Your agents bring troubling, or perhaps promising, news from [Owner.gardens_untended.GetName]. Its ruler, [gardens_untended.Monarch.GetName], has turned away from discipline and self-cultivation. Rather than hone [gardens_untended.Monarch.GetHerHis] Chi or govern with clarity, [gardens_untended.Monarch.GetSheHe] wastes his hours feasting on unhealthy food and beverage with donors and toying with games of sport. One agent even reports them trying to reroute a river flood using their quill on a map. In their neglect, vigilance wanes. With their gaze turned away, a window may be open."
accretive_path_events.1.a: "If they will not tend to their land, perhaps we can tend it for them."
accretive_path_events.1.b: "The failures of others remind us to continually cultivate our own Chi."
accretive_path_events.1.c: "Remind our neighbors of their responsibility to their own Enlightenment."

accretive_path_events.2.t: "Where The Path Begins"
accretive_path_events.2.d: "As [Root.Heir.GetName] enters adolescence and comes ever closer to adulthood, the Chi masters of the palace whisper to you that they are one of the most devout children that they have ever seen. Constantly striving to improve and liberate themselves from that which could take them away from their own cultivation, they have come to you with a request: to conduct a formative experience to root their future rule in practice, not just principle. Advisors debate which path to choose: should the heir walk among taxmen, ride with caravans, or train at the side of hardened warriors? Wherever they go, they will carry the teachings of the Accretive Path, and learn something of their own in turn, but you will need to be sure to guard them well."
accretive_path_events.2.a: "Send them with the tax collectors on their next journey."
accretive_path_events.2.b: "Send them with a trader caravan."
accretive_path_events.2.c: "Send them to train with your most decorated general."
accretive_path_events.2.e: "We cannot spare the men to protect them."

accretive_path_events.3.t: "The Monk and the Blade"
accretive_path_events.3.d: "A young peasant monk, conscripted into our drilling army, has quietly humiliated several veteran soldiers in unarmed bouts. Her movements are serene, her blows precise. She claims they have been honed through years of meditative discipline rather than formal combat. Crowds gather to watch her, and whispers ripple through the ranks. While our generals warn that the woman is disrupting order and would pay handsomely to see her removed, others, especially among the common ranks, see in her a living proof of the Accretive ideal: strength through self-cultivation. The question comes to you - do we promote this woman, or stick with the established order?"
accretive_path_events.3.a: "We should not disrupt the status quo."
accretive_path_events.3.b: "This young woman has much to teach us."
accretive_path_events.3.c: "Her training is a testament to her faith."

accretive_path_events.4.t: "An Empty Scroll"
accretive_path_events.4.d: "At a palace art competition, a talented calligrapher from [empty_scroll_artisthome.GetName] presents a scroll of immaculate craftsmanship… with no visible writing. She claims the ink reveals itself only to those who have cultivated their Chi to its purest form. Philosophers debate whether this is a profound spiritual test or an elaborate fraud. As the scroll passes from hand to hand, awe and skepticism ripple through the court."
accretive_path_events.4.a: " ... This is a joke, right?"
accretive_path_events.4.b: "Let the people decide on its merit."
accretive_path_events.4.c: "Surely there’s a way to unlock the writing. I must journey to find it."

accretive_path_events.5.t: "A Garden of Stillness"
accretive_path_events.5.d: "The temple in [ap_stillgarden_temple.GetName] is famed for its beautiful gardens and serene waterways. The sages there are reporting that many nobles are visiting the new grounds - some seek silent meditation and to increase their connection to their Chi, while others use it as a meeting place to share whispered counsel among the shaded stones. Travelers from across Haless have begun to visit, drawn by the temple’s serenity and its growing reputation as a spiritual and political crossroads. Your advisors are concerned that spies from other nations may be able to use the temple as a way to eavesdrop on our affairs."
accretive_path_events.5.a: "Encourage the nobles. Still water reflects all."
accretive_path_events.5.b: "Restrict access to those truly devoted to cultivating their Chi."

accretive_path_events.6.t: "Enlightenment Incarnate"
accretive_path_events.6.d: "A traveling bard from [ap_enlightenmentincarnate_subject.GetName] has composed verses lauding you and your rule as the “Enlightenment Incarnate.” It is beautiful, but also theologically dangerous. The verses hint that you have already reached Enlightenment, and that you have reached the peak of what you could possibly be capable of. The songs are already beginning to spread. How do you respond?"
accretive_path_events.6.a: "Silence them. Pride must not grow unchecked, and I must not stagnate my personal growth."
accretive_path_events.6.b: "Praise the song and the skill of the bard who penned it, but discourage the cult of personality."
accretive_path_events.6.c: "I haven’t reached my peak yet - there’s more out there to conquer."
accretive_path_events.6.e: "That does sound like me!"

accretive_path_events.7.t: "The Sound of Falling Leaves"
accretive_path_events.7.d: "As the leaves of autumn fall in the palace courtyard in [Root.Capital.GetName], a hush is felt over the entirety of the city. The people are content, trade flows, harvests are bountiful. But some are uneasy. One whispers to you, “If the world offers no resistance, are we still growing? If we seek challenge, do we betray contentment?” You wonder how to respond, but there is no easy answer."
accretive_path_events.7.a: "Stillness is its own teacher."
accretive_path_events.7.b: "We must not grow complacent."
accretive_path_events.7.c: "That you are questioning means you are still struggling."

accretive_path_events.8.t: "Monastic Outreach"
accretive_path_events.8.d: "In [ap_monasticoutreach_province.GetName], a sage from one of our temples humbly requests permission to establish a teaching program among the villagers. He speaks of the quiet power found in steady cultivation of mind and spirit, of the way the Accretive Path can root even the most restless souls in harmony on the path to self-improvement. Such a program would be a beacon of enlightenment in a land still shadowed by doubt, but it demands resources from the realm. Your council is divided: some see this as a vital step towards spiritual unity, others warn of overreach and squandered coin."
accretive_path_events.8.a: "Fund the program generously."
accretive_path_events.8.b: "Their path to enlightenment is their own."
accretive_path_events.8.c: "The sage has our blessing, but not our gold."

accretive_path_events.9.t: "Stones in the Stream"
accretive_path_events.9.d: "In [ap_stonesinstream_province.GetName], our missionaries report growing resistance. Sermons are interrupted by children throwing stones, shrines become defaced in the night, and vaudeville acts satirizing our beliefs gather guffawing gawkers. Some advise sending in guards to restore order and protect the faithful from violent escalation. One monk shares an ancient teaching with a gentler view: “A stone settles in a stream - the fish wonders, is it wiser to break it with my body, or allow the current to weather it away for my children’s children?”"
accretive_path_events.9.a: "Post guards. Order will guide understanding, and our missionaries must be protected."
accretive_path_events.9.b: "Our descendents will see the rock worn away."
accretive_path_events.9.c: "The missionaries can deal with some children without our interference"
accretive_path_events.11.t: "Automatically convert to Accretive Path"
accretive_path_events.11.d: ""
ap_stonesinstream_convert_tooltip: "§YOnce you've converted this province to Accretive Path, the guards you've posted will pay dividends.§!"
accretive_path_events.13.t: "Order Guided Understanding"
accretive_path_events.13.d: "The guards that you initially posted to protect the sages in [This.GetName] have been put to work now that the mission to convert the people here is complete."
accretive_path_events.13.a: "Their hard work will guide their path to enlightenment."

accretive_path_events.10.t: "Rusted Blades"
accretive_path_events.10.d: "The nearly full barracks of [ap_rustedblades_province.GetName] should echo with drills, meditation, and long discussions of purpose. Instead they are filled with an idle hum, while our soldiers are lazing about, meandering without direction. The general corps petition your court: “In times of peace, steel can rust. Some soldiers are concerned about their chi and path to enlightenment while we stay at home. But steel can be sharpened, and rust can be polished. We propose the ‘Quiet March’ - a series of rotating deployments to aid in harvests, train the body and mind, and remind our people that peace is not passive - and our soldiers the benefits of hard work in this life and the lives after.” The proposal is ambitious. Some worry that soldiers roaming the countryside will sow disquiet among the peasantry."
accretive_path_events.10.a: "Let the March begin. Our swords must walk among our people."
accretive_path_events.10.b: "Your training should be what sharpens your steel. Remain at your post."
accretive_path_events.12.t: "The Quiet March"
accretive_path_events.12.d: "For the past several months, you have been working with your generals and advisors to prepare for the Quiet March, discussing logistics, the travel path, and how to keep your army ready in case of sudden attack from your neighbors. As the troops file out of the barracks in [ap_rustedblades_province.GetName], several soldiers are heard grumbling about the hard work ahead, while others are reverently excited for the opportunity to embark on a new path of self-improvement. There is only one question remaining: As discipline can take many forms, what shall be the focus of the March?"
accretive_path_events.12.a: "Aid in the harvest and share the work of the land."
accretive_path_events.12.b: "Focus on recruitment and martial demonstration."
accretive_path_events.12.c: "Protect the roads, caravans and merchants."
accretive_path_events.12.e: "Teach the values of the Path - self-discipline, self-refinement, striving to master your craft."
accretive_path_events.12.f: "Speak to travelers - learn the quiet truths of Haless"
ap_rustedblades_war: "§RThis modifier will be lost if you go to war!\n§!"
