 H35_lights_in_shadow_desc:0 "Too long have we found ourselves defenseless against the sharpened spears and wicked witchery of the rune warriors. If we truly wish to forge a holy empire to stand against not only the witch and the wizard, but the shaman as well, then first we must follow in the words and actions of our Lady and pick up our swords and shields. To this end, we must create a militia of men of the utmost faith and training. Soon then, may we strike back against our innumerable enemies."
 H35_beginning_sentries_title:0 "Beginning The Sentries"
 H35_beginning_sentries_desc:0 "For too long have we suffered such grievous abuses at the hands of the rune warriors. They saw fit to attack us with their foul magics and slaughter a third of our number before our feet had even found our soil; we shall repay the favor tenfold. Let us arm our men with the finest weaponry, forge them the strongest armor, and imbue them with the most righteous spirit, and let us charge into the dwellings of the savages and let none — no woman, man, nor heathen child — survive. We will flense their witch-drawn scribbles clean from their hide, if we must."

 H35_organizing_leadership_desc:0 "While our grand Sentries are not in want of weapons or training, we lack goodmen wizened in the ways of warfare. From our stock, let us pull those with the most righteous fire held within their hearts and name them leaders. Just as we devote ourselves to the Martyr, let our Sentries devote themselves to their new leaders; through fire and war shall they lead them."
 H35_land_redistribution_title:0 "Land Redistribution"
 H35_land_redistribution_desc:0 "It has become abundantly clear to us that the savage river-worshippers simply have no clue how to farm. The crops they grow are diminutive in size and lack flavor; famines and plagues wrack their countryside every winter. Clearly, the degenerative and disinterested attitudes of their kings, no doubt encouraged by their retinue of witches, has caused this rot to spread throughout the countryside. We will seize this land and redistribute it to goodmen who wish to help their fellow man, and know the proper Corinsfielder ways of farming. The previous owners will be allowed to stay, of course - the farms will need labor, after all."
 H35_breadbasket_of_aelantir_title:0 "Breadbasket of Aelantir"
 H35_breadbasket_of_aelantir_desc:0 "For the first harvest in centuries, nary a goodman has starved. Our experiments in crop rotation have ensured that our people are fed, year-round; even throughout the most dire of winters, our stockpiles remain bountiful. With the end of famine, the Crimson Reverend can finally proclaim one of the nation’s oldest enemies as good as dead. Our children grow healthier, and healthy children develop into fine soldiers and righteous priests - the better to fight our eternal enemy."

 H35_banks_of_corynn_desc:0 "Through persecution, pursuit, and plague, we have persisted. From our ruined homes in Escann, to the cruel seas and the sheer cliffs of the Ruin, to the savage rune warriors of these plains, here the Martyr has finally guided us to bountiful fields, to rolling hills of red poppies and green grass. Here, we will survive — no, here we will thrive, and never again shall we be crushed under the iron boot of wizardry, be it sorcerers or shamans.\n\nNever. again."
 H35_securing_veykoda_title:0 "Securing Veykoda"
 H35_securing_veykoda_desc:0 "We are not alone. Our vicious rivals, the rune warriors with their foul magics and savage dispositions, are not our only competitors for the throne of Aelantir. Cannorians have infested our holy plains, bringing with them the foul wizards of the old world. First amongst them are the hedonist halflings of West Tipney, too preoccupied with pipeweed and pumpkins to realize that their enemies aren’t the humans who siege their homeland but the mages who control them; second amongst them are the dwarven smiths of Argezvale, absorbed within their folly that they can befriend the savages; last amongst this unholy host are the bandits, sinners, and ne’er-do-wells of New Havoral, who preach that all are equal, long as they can pick a pocket or slit a throat. We must save them all from their foolish notions."
 H35_raising_defenses_title:0 "Raising The Defenses"
 H35_raising_defenses_desc:0 "Just as the turtle was gifted a strong shell to protect itself from ravenous predators, we too must protect ourselves from the destructive impulses of wizardry. It is no secret that all other nations, those cruel mageocracies, wish us to be crushed underfoot. Let not a single soldier pass into our nation; let watchful eyes guard a fort in every town. Let Corinsfield become a grand stone turtle unto itself, to protect our nation, our companions, and our faith forevermore."
 H35_safe_at_last_title:0 "Safe at Last"
 H35_safe_at_last_desc:0 "The Veykoda has been united under our grasp; travelers can venture from Poppyspring to Havorton without fear of savages, bandits, or magic. Now, we must look inwards. Families must grow large and happy, the Sentries must grow strong and disciplined, and the Inquisitors must continue their holiest work of burning out the vile stain of witchery.\nWe will bide our time.\nYes, we will grow.\nAnd once we have grown…\n\nMay our faithful strike terror into the hearts of all mages."

 H35_further_farmlands_desc:0 "“For goodness without action means nothing,”\n“And from nothing the roots of evil will fester,”\n\nWe have sat idle for long enough. We have built a strong nation of neighbors and a bulwark against witchery and all who would oppose us. Just as Corin struck her sword into the heart of the dread mage Dookanson, so shall we destroy the center of maleficarum in Aelantir! March, goodman, onwards! Today, we liberate the Ynn!"
 H35_dams_and_dome_title:0 "Dams and The Dome"
 H35_dams_and_dome_desc:0 "One of the most essential parts of the reeducation of the Ynnic peoples into Corinsfielder society is the destruction of the heretical garbage they hold dear. Without these idols most unholy to guide them in their worship, confused and dazed, they §Gwill§! turn to the Martyr of Escann for strength and willpower; from there, the majority of our job is already complete.\n\nThe only stickling point here is how, exactly, to deal with these monuments. To destroy them would be righteous, yes, but they are of immense value; perhaps our most righteous efforts could turn a profit, as well."
 H35_crimson_cathedral_title:0 "The Crimson Cathedral"
 H35_crimson_cathedral_desc:0 "Now that the previously heretical Ynnics have seen the light of the Crimson Lady, they need another monument to look towards and admire, somewhere for their hearts to wander in times of need and despair. That goes for the common folk as well, all need her light, all need her blessing.\n\nSo it shall be done, with faith and hope in our hearts, we shall construct a monument worthy of her grace!"
 H35_settlement_surveys_title:0 "Settlement Surveys"
 H35_settlement_surveys_desc:0 "If we wish to master these lands, first we must understand them. Leave no nook unmapped, no cranny undiscovered, and no stone unturned. We must know our neighbors, and verily we must hate them, for any nation held under sway of magery is thine own enemy in our heart of hearts."
 H35_maleficar_sympathizers_title:0 "Maleficar Sympathizers"
 H35_maleficar_sympathizers_desc:0 "Hundreds hiding amongst the newly conquered peoples have been marked for death. These foul wretches, the witches and warlocks intermixed within their towns and forts - all must be forced out and put to the noose or the pyre. None with the potential can be suffered to live; even a single one has the potential for untold tragedy. So, righteous men of Corinsfield, with the holy flame of our Lady in your heart, order yourselves as to find these witches and put them to the sword — put the ones hiding them to the sword, and put their mothers and brothers and sons and daughters to the sword. Never again shall the mages rule us."

 H35_anti_mage_weaponry_desc:0 "Corin bless our rifles, for no mage can stop a volley of righteous shots\n\nCorin bless our armor, for no fire or lightning can pierce our steel\n\nCorin bless our cannons, for our cannonballs will crash their towers to nought\n\nCorin bless us, one and all, and may mages forever fear our faithful zeal\n\nFor we are Corinsfielders, from our buttons to our stitches\n\nOnwards we march, to the ruin of all witches!"
 H35_ban_sex_title:0 "Cultural Crackdown"
 H35_ban_sex_desc:0 "The Ynnics cannot be permitted to continue to languor in their degeneracy. We must go in with flame and sword and purge all elements of magery within their number. It may be bloody - but their children shall thank us. By the Martyr, the savages will be brought to heel and shown proper civilization - no matter how many must be sent to her."
 H35_safety_from_sin_title:0 "Safety from Sin"
 H35_safety_from_sin_desc:0 "Aelantir has been freed from the malevolent forces that have strangled it for far too long. Magery, witchery, shamanism - call it what you want, for it is now a vague memory in the minds of most. Our enemies have been detoothed and declawed, and find themselves completely at our bountiful mercies.\n\nFamilies want not for food nor faith; every home has bountiful supplies of bread and cheese, and every young mind has been matured and shaped by our schools.\n\nThe fools of the Veykoda and the savages of the Ynn have been fully pacified and converted. Any whelp, be they halfling, ruinborn, or Havoralic, know of our Lady, our Father, and our mission.\n\nIn Corinsfield, all is well. All is good."
 H35_father_and_daughter_title:0 "Father and Daughter"
 H35_father_and_daughter_desc:0 "Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there was a young man who lived happily with his beautiful wife and their beautiful daughter. Then plague took his wife, so the man took his daughter and moved to what seemed to be greener pastures. However, what malady began, maleficarum finished, and the man found himself bereft. Every day for ten long years, the old man awoke at the crack of dawn to search for his daughter.\n\nOne day, he found her.\n\nAnd that’s when he realized that there was no recompense for witchery but death."
 H35_first_mage_trials_title:0 "The First Mage Trials"
 H35_first_mage_trials_desc:0 "The single greatest talent of the witch is betrayal. The witch is not always some cackling old hag who lives in a fetid swamp in a great hut made of the bones of children - they might be your trusted neighbor; greet you early, and then curse your cattle to starve your family after the sun drops from view. They could be your beloved wife; kiss you goodbye in the morn when you go to tend the fields, and steal the life from your beloved child whilst you are away. They could even be your beloved child, waiting for their chance to strike with a poisoned blade into your heart whilst you drift off to sleep. So love thy neighbor, cherish thy family — but always remember they could be traitors to your country, your home, and your God. Our newest order of inquisitors, men of the most righteous faith, shall hunt these vermin to no end - until we are free."

 H35_liturgical_literacy_title:0 "Liturgical Literacy"
 H35_liturgical_literacy_desc:0 "In order for our nation to function, we need learned men. Faith and righteousness will only get us so far - if we wish to truly understand the commandments of Father and Martyr alike, then we must ensure our couters can not just read, but understand. This has not been a problem in Poppyspring, or the areas surrounding it; however, the rural areas where we have not exercised such control have fallen to the wayside. A grand center of learning shall we build, then, and encourage these righteous goodmen from the borders to attend. Investment in them can only benefit us down the line."
 H35_common_corin_education_title:0 "Common Education"
 H35_common_corin_education_desc:0 "No longer shall we continue like the heretic ilk of Cannor; let not the most exclusive knowledge of the world be held so greedily by our rich. No - unto the heads of each and every goodman of Corinsfield shall the most inspired knowledge be imparted. We shall teach them their letters, we shall teach them their abilities, and - most importantly - we shall teach them in the matters of unbreakable faith. Let the torches of knowledge and faith be lit in tandem, and let their blinding flames burn away the false knowledge of heretics and heathens."
 H35_corinspoppy_compact_title:0 "Corinspoppy Compact"
 H35_corinspoppy_compact_desc:0 "Let us declare a great companionship between all the good people of Corinsfield. In the name of our Lady we shall give our lives. We shall not suffer the rule of neither tyrant king nor greedy merchant, but instead let our faith alone guide us. Let each town be administered by the gentle hand of their spiritual guides, and from amongst themselves let these holies name one Crimson Reverend to speak for all the nation. As the bountiful Corinspoppies bind our feet to our soil and our souls to the Martyr of Escann, let this contract bind each and every neighbor forevermore."
 H35_piety_of_masses_title:0 "Piety of the Masses"
 H35_piety_of_masses_desc:0 "The venerable amongst us have begun to depart for the more hallowed planes. Soon, very soon, there will be few amongst us who have trodden in the verdant grasses of Escann. However, this may not be a bad thing. With our new homelands come new ideals, and sooner, rather than later, the worthy boots of these worthy holy men shall be filled once more - now, by goodmen who believe wholeheartedly in our most divine mission since their birth. Furthermore, we shall do away with needless stratification altogether; little need have we for greaves, bevors, or helms when all men are equal in death."
 H35_in_proper_company_title:0 "In Proper Company"
 H35_in_proper_company_desc:0 "To some, the death of a child might be a tragedy. However, it must be questioned by the goodmen; what is the death of one child compared to the death of hundreds, from pointless wars or cruel experiments? Verily, the ending of one life then is not that cruel a price to pay. Thereby must we live, as Corinsfielders. Let the foul little witchings be dashed upon the rocks to save thousands of worthy children later. Lo, verily let the eye of suspicion fall upon the mother if her mourning be so great, for one who does not understand the small sacrifices we all must make for the Martyr of Escann is as dangerous to our people as a witch."
 H35_blessed_book_title:0 "The Blessed Book"
 H35_blessed_book_desc:0 "For too long, our holiest doctrine has been under the foul sway of a most terrible thing - tradition. If we seek true righteousness, we need total uniformity in our faith. Else, the poor common man finds his mind open to the malefictions of witches and mages and heathens - this will not do. Our most learned goodmen and the good Crimson Reverend shall convene; from our scattered books of hymns and the memories of our beknighted ancestors we shall forge a book for all good Corinsfielders to hold close to their heart, knowing they shall never stray from the path."
 H35_father_godwin_title:0 "Godwin's Dream"
 H35_father_godwin_desc:0 "The most virtuous society that our Father once dreamed of has nearly been achieved. The stain of Witchery has been uprooted in every town of Corinsfield, and every goodman, goody, and child of Corinsfield reveres the Martyr just as they should. We have even struck into the heart of heathenry and sorcery and seen its inhabitants converted and contained. No longer must we focus on our center; now, it is time for us to launch a crusade the likes of which the world has never seen. Let all mages, sorcerers, shamans, what-have-you, fear us - for the righteous fury of the sons and daughters of Corinsfield shall drag them to hell."
 H35_corin_country_title:0 "Corin's Country"
 H35_corin_country_desc:0 "The most faithful aims, once thought totally impossible, have been achieved. The magery of the surrounding nations has been purged, totally; the nations’ peoples may not be satisfied with the killings, but they will see the necessity in time. As the decaying mageocracies of Cannor rip each other apart in the names of vanity, gluttony, pride, and sin, let all in Aelantir prosper in the absence of witchery most foul."

From the first night when we set foot in the plains of Veykoda, they have hassled us to no end - slaughtering a third of our number of most righteous Corinspilgrims and stealing our most valuable supplies of food and water. Most offensive of all, however, are their tattoos - onto their very skin do they inscribe their magic, ensuring that each and every one of their number is granted the insidious and hideous power of the witch.\n\nNo longer shall this be permitted to continue. By the Martyr, once we have finished our righteous mission, these vermin will be naught but stories to scare children with in the darkest times of night.\n\nSo, goodmen, march forth - let our campaign of annihilation begin."

A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, armed with torches and swords and spears and guns, clad in uniforms drenched red in the blood of their enemies. They march in the night, believing that they are not expected. Their enemies are used to this trick - they used it too many times on those who couldn’t fight back, and now those that can know it all too well.\n\nChieftain Rapanach holds up his hand. Behind him are all the men he has left. Brave fighters, hundreds in number, dedicated entirely to their families and their tribe. Few of their sabertooth cats remain - much like their owners, most have been hunted down and skinned by the Fieldsmen. Today, every warrior here will die. Each and every single one of them. He can scarcely make eye contact - even though each and every man knows this. What remains of the Veykodans have fled their home. The Chieftain and his men are the last of the fighters, left behind to ensure the escape of the rest. Where they will escape they do not know; the only direction they know now is away, away from the savages in their tall hats with their hymns and their guns. For now, at least, this is still their home. And they will fight. Let them at least take down three krahnorians for every Veykodan that falls.\n\nThe red glow of the torches, red like blood, grows closer. The last of the Veykodans ready their spears and raise their arms, their side illuminated by their glowing tattoos. Those who have guns, as loot from the dead or from trade, raise them and aim at the oncoming horde.\n\nThe first shots ring out."

Known for his mastery of tactics in open battle and his ability to attain the great respect of his men, the common soldiers of the Red Sentries cheer on his ascension.\n\nHowever, some of the high-ranking Red Sentry brass have concerns about him - specifically, his peculiar obsession with “honor”. On his record are multiple cases where he was flogged by his superiors for defying orders to attack Veykodan camps where “innocents” such as women and children - innocents, bah! - had not yet fled. They fear that if a cunning enemy were to employ underhanded tactics against Roose, his defenses would crumble."

Such excess for the dead while the living are left to starve and rot is sickening - however, a large section of couters greatly protest disturbing the dead, even if they themselves do not believe in these pagan rituals.

The great lands held by the nobles have been confiscated by Red Sentry and Inquisitor alike and given back to the people over whom they once held dominion and thus, destitute and starved, is their hold broken.\n\nNow, however, comes the logistically difficult issue. The Witch. While we were able to purge witchery from our former conquered neighbors, halfling and dwarf, they weren’t as… entrenched as the water mages of Ynnic society. They still hold the minds of many of the common folk - poor savages - and are unwilling to fall without a fight.

They were some of the first converts to the Martyr of Escann’s good faith - Godwin himself being one of the very first of the couters, the priests who dedicated themselves to the Martyr’s worship - and there they lived a good life.\n\nA plague that swept the countryside tore his wife away from him. So, seeking greener grass, he took his daughter and moved to the neighboring kingdom of Esthíl, which offered generous grants of land to any Corinite pilgrims who wished it. There, they made a new home and found a community in their fellow pilgrims in a small village long since forgotten.\n\nOne day, late in the night, Godwin heard screams. He could open his eyes and look about, but found himself unable to move his limbs - a man paralyzed. All he could see from the dark edges of his vision were cloaked figures dragging out a sack. In the morning, his daughter was gone.\n\nEvery day he would go stand in the streets of their village and cry for help. But, even though the man and daughter were part of the village, none ever stopped to assist him. Even as more and more of the young people of the village seemed to go missing, the community never banded together to help one another. That was the way of things until one day when a strange man, clad in the same cloak he saw on that fateful night approached him. The man introduced himself as Calas, and told him one simple statement.\n\n“I know where your daughter is.” And so, he brought Father Godwin to a small building, far from any homes. In it, rickety wooden stairs led down, down, down, into the dark.\n\nGodwin opened the doors at the bottom of the staircase. There, he saw bodies - hundreds of them. Sickly, pale covered in scars and bruises, with most being mutilated in some way. Some missed their arms and legs, some had spare arms and legs crudely sown on. Each and every single body had the glazed over eyes of one long since dead, and yet their breath shallowly drew still. Occasionally, a scream, shrill and piercing, would cry out. Some had veins running to clear sacs filled with strange fluids, brightly colored and violently bubbling.\n\nNot a single body seemed to be older than thirty years. Here were the missing.\n\n“The lords of Esthíl seek power,” was the only explanation provided by Calas, “and they have forsaken whatever humanity they had.”\n\nOff to the side of the room is where he found her. She drew breath, but no longer resided in the land of the living.\n\nIn an instant, it was as if a tinder struck within his heart. Father Godwin heard a voice speak to him. A woman’s voice - he wondered at first if it was his daughter, but dismissed the thought in an instant. No. The voice was the Martyr of Escann, and she told him words that he would remember until the end of his days.\n\n“Look upon their works, good Father, and know that the only recompense for witchery is death.”\n\nThe next week he returned, now accompanied by the rest of the village. They had to see what had been done to their children. And they, too, needed to learn the truth.\n That the only recompense for witchery is death.\n\nThey decided to burn the foul building and put the miserable wretches out of their misery. Watching the flames rise, Father Godwin prayed to the Martyr. His thoughts lingering on his daughter’s twisted form, he knew in his heart - the old world is irreparably stained by the foul taint of magic. Their future lies in the new world."

He peered over his bench. “You stand accused of weaving vile enchantment into the songs you sing to your flock, and further witchery in your methods of leading them away from Corin.”\n\n“Goodman, if you would only allow me my lute, I could show you my methods of praising Corin, and how they have brought the ruinborn to worship-”\n\nProudfoot was cut off by a shout somewhere between the words of a man and the growling of a beast.“You have spoken too long already! Every moment you dare to sit here as if there is a possibility of your innocence is a moment this audience is being corrupted by the illusions you are no doubt weaving at this very moment!” Proudfoot was struck by the sudden thought that the judge’s face appeared to be turning the exact same shade of red as was used on the flag of Corinsfield. “IF YOU THINK I WILL ALLOW A HALFLING, AND A WITCH HALFLING BESIDES, TO COME TO MY COURT AND LECTURE ME ON THE PROPER WORSHIP OF CORIN, YOUR ENCHANTMENTS HAVE FINALLY HOLLOWED OUT YOUR FEEBLE BRAIN!” The judge paused to take a gulp of air as if this would be his last chance. “There will be no trial today, for the danger to this community is too great as it stands. The witch is guilty. Burn this witch in the town square but before you do so, have his vocal cords ripped out and displayed to his disciples, so that they might see what his witchery has earned him and they may be returned to the faithful.”\n\nThat appeared to be the trial, then. As Proudfoot was led away, he dwelled for a moment on an old saying of his mother’s."

The jeering of the villagers seemed to drain away as in his mind’s eye he was taken back to happier times. \n\nWas it five years ago? Ten? He had spent all day pumping the bellows, but he could stay pumping for another day, for he knew this attempt would be the one. The walls were lined with failed ladles. The first was more a chunk of metal than any kind of serviceable implement, the second did not have a scoop, the fifth did not have a handle, the seventh… On down the line it went. \n\nHe pumped and pumped, until he realized that the sound of hammering had been replaced with the sound of a final quenching. He stood then, and almost bumped head first into his apprentice. Her face was dripping with sweat and its color seemed to match the flaming red of her hair, but in her hands she held a ladle and her smile stretched from ear to ear when she said to him, “Are you proud of me?”\n\nHe was, he was proud beyond words. He scooped her up into a great embrace, and then into the shop came Silas Goodhope, the baker’s boy. Rebecca let go of him and ran to Silas, holding her ladle aloft, and Thomas could not help but notice the way he looked at her then. Silas and Rebecca had been friends since she came to his shop for her apprenticeship, but the air between them seemed different recently, and he hoped they would be happy with each other.\n\nThe splatter of a tomato against his face jolted him back to reality. The magistrate was reading now. “Thomas Clarke! You have been found guilty of witchcraft, and you have been sentenced to burn in the same fire you used to craft your foul magicks. Were you to give up the location of the known members of your coven Silas and Rebecca Goodhope, your sentence might be lightened.” The magistrate paused, and when he received no response he motioned to the firestarter to ignite the pyre. \n\nThomas was crying. The tears evaporated on his face, and his skin began to warp, and under his breath only to himself he was chanting, and the words were:"

Only the debauched mind of a witch could imagine such a thing. The gaunt body of the damned, the claws of a beast, and the head of a deer - an animal we all know to be associated with foul magics.” The crowd murmured in assent as they looked at the accused - and the accused returned a hollow look, their mouth chittering.\n\n“But now, we shall reveal this witch to all, so they will truly answer for their crimes in slaughtering a village of Corin-fearing goodfolk! Bring forth the blessed water, so we may douse them and reveal their true form to all!” Praise-Corin shouted, as a pail was brought forward. He muttered a prayer, and the water was thrown over the witch.\n\nAnd nothing happened.\n\nThe crowd and Praise-Corin looked shocked. Even if blessed water wasn’t, well… wholly effective, usually freezing cold water was enough to knock some sense back into a witch. But this meant that… \n\nThe beast shook against its bonds. It let out a guttural screech at the crowd, and many stepped away in fear. Praise-Corin gulped, before regaining some composure.\n\n“This, this… Witch’s familiar, yes! It must have been separated from its dark master in the chaos of its wanton slaughter. Its master shall be found, but for now, we shall punish the servant nonetheless. I declare it guilty, and sentence it to be burnt at the stake! Guards, take it away!”\n\nPraise-Corin said his words triumphantly, but any surety in them left as the beast was dragged out of the courtroom. His eyes followed the beast, as it struggled under its bonds, howling and gnashing its fangs. And all the while, its eyes remained fixed on him."

Yet you, sir, most assuredly have not, and have brought the greatest evil on Halann to this hallowed land! WHAT do you have to say for yourself, Talvyr, what possible defence could there even be for these HEINOUS acts?”\n\nThe inquisitor, throwing these words at Talvyr in his harangue, receives little in the way of a response from the Sardan. He clutches onto the stand, steadying himself as he blinks to try and return to the room. Talvyr turns, with a grin on his face, towards the inquisitor.\n\n“Can you… hmm… remind me of what exactly I said I could do…?” Talvyr slurred. The inquisitor glanced at the audience with a raised eyebrow, as - unusually - some muffled giggles emerged from the crowd.\n\n“Well, of course, if you need your GUILT proven even more than it already is! You claimed that you could control the winds, use them to cause FOUL MAGICAL ODOURS to disrupt our good town… That you could POISON OUR WELLS with but a flick of your finger… and… and… why is everyone laughing…?”\n\nThe room was in uproarious laughter, and Talvyr himself was laughing. As the inquisitor stood there, flabbergasted, he began to cough, and covered his mouth from the foul smell emanating from Talvyr. That caused everyone to laugh even harder.\n\n“And now, my dear audience, I shall show you all how I will poison your waters, using my mighty witching wand!” Talvyr crowed, and the laughter rose in volume as he started to undo his trouser button.\n\nRed in the face from embarrassment and anger, the inquisitor grabbed Talvyr by the scruff of his collar. “You drunken buffoon! You dare make a mockery of me, of this court, of our righteous fight against witchery and its evil? Guards, prepare the pyre for this fool!”\n\nThe roughness of the guards and the unmitigated fury of the inquisitor stilled the laughter in the court hall.

This Trollsbayer - already by dint of his origins a reason to be suspicious - had come with a troupe of performers to their little town, promising a night of wonder to the locals. The only wonder was that it had taken until Milner saw the performance to notice the foul air about it. The stench of something not quite right… of magic. And this performer at the centre of it - promising to make objects disappear, to bisect another performer and put them back together?! He is lucky the town was so bewitched by the display that they did not carry him to the pyre before a proper trial could be conducted!\n\nMilner interrupted the performer. “Ah, yes, part of the circus? So you have no explanation for your strange acts that you performed before this very crowd! They all saw the witchery for what it is, didn’t they?”\n\nHe swept his hand in a motion towards the crowd, and they all shouted and screamed their agreement in response. He laughed obliquely as the performer shrunk in the face of their anger. Perhaps a little of their theatrics had sunk in - but Milner dismissed that thought. He would never let magicks influence him, and that is what was at stake here.\n\n“We-we just wanted to put on a little show for you all, bring a little joy and entertainment for an evening. We didn't want to offend or cause any problems…” The performer’s voice shrunk in the stand, losing his nerve. Milner smirked in response, and turned to the crowd.\n\n“So the witch has no defence, no explanation for their acts. For the threat they pose to the goodmen and goodwives of this town! And so, what should we do with him?” He shouted to the crowd, goading them to provide the only response they knew to give.\n\n“The pyre! The pyre! BURN THE WITCH!”\n\nMilner, ever eager to please his audience, banged his gavel, confirming the verdict of the crowd, and handed the sobbing performer over to the bailiffs."

Around the child and her family was a crowd - a shouting, jeering, baying crowd. Calling for violence, for blood, for justice. So were her parents, her father only stopped by her child’s question.\n\n“Because my dear, this witch was found in the haunted woods, living alone in a hidden shack. No-one who lives in such a cursed place, far away from good Corinites, can be planning anything good or wholesome.”\n\n“But, but, father, don’t we collect nuts and berries from that forest?

Don’t you know what befell your friends? He coaxed them to visit, so he could curse them!”\n\n“But how did he curse them?” The child asked.

While only Corinite couters can hold positions of power, there are no restrictions on becoming a couter besides the nomination of the prior. While this does seem as if it would lead to nepotism, such as a couter nominating their own family, this is held at bay by the strict social taboos of their community. The Crimson Reverend must be chosen by two-thirds of the couters, and from there they must be able to recite five Corinite hymns from memory."

From there, the assembly votes - a new law or state action requires a two-thirds majority, and the presiding Crimson Reverend has the ability to veto laws they view as unjust or blasphemous.
