 apikhoxi_show_of_force_title: "Show of Force"
 apikhoxi_show_of_force_desc: "Our plowshares may bend to the earth, but our spirits stand unbowed. While we seek peace above all, we must show that the humble farmer can defend their own lands against predators both animal and sentient. The sight of our militia drilling in the morning mists serves not as a threat, but as a reminder that we are not the docile sheep Ormam would like to view us as."

 apikhoxi_better_a_warrior_title: "Better a Warrior"
 apikhoxi_better_a_warrior_desc: "In an ideal world, we would tend only to our gardens and crops, but our lands are not blessed with such peaceful tranquility. The Apikhoxí Guard shall evolve from a simple militia of farmers into a professional force, pioneering new methods of warfare that value each soldier's life. Using specialized armor and coordinated battle groups, we will create an army that fights smarter, not harder - protecting our people while still maintaining devastating effectiveness against threats like the Amgremósi raiders."

 apikhoxi_the_anger_of_a_calm_people_title: "The Anger of a Stoic People"
 apikhoxi_the_anger_of_a_calm_people_desc: "Though we are peaceful, our anger when roused is like a summer storm - terrible and cleansing. Though we wish for nothing but to enjoy our modest lives undisturbed, we cannot stand by idly while Amgremós continues its brutal slave trade. Our anger, like the furious summer rain washing away all traces of a long drought, will be unleashed against those who chain and torture their fellow kin. The pirates of Amgremós shall learn that even the most stoic people, when faced with such unrelenting evil, can see their cold anger stoked into an all-encompassing wave of violence."

 apikhoxi_brothers_in_exile_title: "Brothers in Exile"
 apikhoxi_brothers_in_exile_desc: "From chained convicts to schemers in shadows, Besolakí has carved its own path, but we do share the bitter memory of Kheionai bondage. While they play their games of daggers in the dark, we offer something more substantial: the means to fund their damestear project and seize the island prizes they covet. After all, who better to trust than fellow survivors of Alecandi heavy-handedness?"

 apikhoxi_little_league_title: "Little League"
 apikhoxi_little_league_desc: "The merchants of Eneion still speak with pride of being the first Nékhei colony, their dreams of controlling the Eneionam as grandiose as their ancestors'. With Degakheion's grip weakening, we could offer them more than a mere alliance - a chance to seize Serigastisi and form a league with us, under our distant and understanding guidance, of course."

 apikhoxi_calm_and_reasonable_discussion_title: "Out by The Roots"
 apikhoxi_calm_and_reasonable_discussion_desc: "While our fields flourish and our granaries overflow, the merchants of Ormam demand ever more. As stewards of the Devandi breadbasket, we must remind our overlords that even the most fertile fields can turn barren under poor management. With our growing strength in both arms and agricultural expertise, perhaps it is time for a pointed renegotiation of what it means to be their Nékheis."

 apikhoxi_time_to_harvest_title: "Time for Harvest"
 apikhoxi_time_to_harvest_desc: "The wheat stands golden in our fields, and our resolve has ripened with it. Just as each stalk bends with the weight of its grain, so too must our old loyalties give way to new freedoms. Ormam will find that the seeds of cruelty that they have sown are finally ripe for the harvest."

 apikhoxi_share_the_bounty_of_freedom_title: "Share Freedom's Gifts"
 apikhoxi_share_the_bounty_of_freedom_desc: "Having cast off our own yoke of servitude, Apikhoxí will not stand idly by while others remain enslaved. Filled with solidarity and defiance, we shall share our liberty with all Nékheis willing to stand against tyranny, in an uprising to throw off the shackles of the wealthy Kheions. Callous despots whose prosperity is built upon our suffering."

 apikhoxi_chains_for_grains_title: "Chains for Grains"
 apikhoxi_chains_for_grains_desc: "Throughout Alecand and Devand, thousands are unjustly enslaved, tirelessly toiling in fields and growing crops yet never enjoying the fruits of the harvest. Elves who would gladly welcome the opportunity to farm their own crops for their own benefit. Well, we have both the demand for labor and the spare land to offer. We simply need to bring these unfortunates here, whether by underhanded methods or not."

 apikhoxi_mind_our_own_gardens_title: "Mind Our Own Gardens"
 apikhoxi_mind_our_own_gardens_desc: "The valleys have their guardians, and the plains have their farmers - each tending to their own sacred spaces. We shall respect the Mteibhar's ancient covenant with their valley spirits, just as they respect our connection to the open fields. It is a hallmark of civilization to recognize where your garden ends and your neighbor's begins."
 mind_our_gardens_tt: "\nIf you should conquer a Mteibhar province, or change a province to Mteibhar culture, you will lose this!"

 apikhoxi_ride_the_river_road_title: "Ride the River Road"
 apikhoxi_ride_the_river_road_desc: "The Xiktheam shall become more than just a source of water for our fields - it shall be the great road that binds our homesteads together. Our barges and riverboats will connect every farm along its banks, carrying crops, goods, and people swiftly through our heartlands. By developing embarkation stations along its course, we will transform this mighty waterway into the bustling artery linking every hamlet and township in the nation."

 apikhoxi_specialty_farms_title: "Specialty Farms"
 apikhoxi_specialty_farms_desc: "More than adept in growing simple wheat and vegetables, our farmers now dare to dream bigger - as fields of sugarcane and tea plants rise alongside our oceans of golden wheat, we celebrate each neighbor bold enough to reach beyond necessity and diversify their harvests. The first Kylakas Day festival will remind us that true prosperity means having the freedom to grow what delights, not just what fills the belly."

 apikhoxi_sweet_deal_title: "A Sweet Deal"
 apikhoxi_sweet_deal_desc: "Keyolíon's single-minded pursuit of the perfect sugar cane has caught our attention - as has their longing gaze toward Vothelisí's shores. With our agricultural proficiency and their specialized expertise, we could forge a mutually beneficial arrangement: they shall join our flock, in a partnership with rewards as sweet as their beloved crop."

 apikhoxi_field_of_the_free_title: "Field of the Free"
 apikhoxi_field_of_the_free_desc: "From blood and chains, the people of the Devand have risen to become free farmers on their own soil. Not by conquest or inheritance, but by the sacred right of those who nurture the land. Our fields stretch to the horizon, and every furrow, every fence, every farmhouse stands as testament to our hard-won independence."

 apikhoxi_widen_the_door_title: "Widen the Door"
 apikhoxi_widen_the_door_desc: "While the wealthy Kheions see their slaves and poor as burdens, we see tomorrow's free farmers. We shall trade our harvests for their unwanted - the barges containing grain shipments will return with those they deem worthless. The so-called refuse from the gutters of their vaunted cities will in time become our new neighbors and fellow farmers."

 apikhoxi_down_by_the_river_title: "Down by the River"
 apikhoxi_down_by_the_river_desc: "We wave to the transports, each carrying our hopes and future upstream. With our river fleet establishing regular routes, we lay claim to all lands along its banks up to Lake Mteidhan. These ferries and riverboats will be but the first step in weaving our nation together through this mighty waterway, creating a transport network that will serve farmer and trader alike."

 apikhoxi_livestock_of_the_sea_title: "Livestock of the Sea"
 apikhoxi_livestock_of_the_sea_desc: "Our ancestors taught us to nurture the soil; now we must learn to nurture the sea. By constructing docks and marketplaces in the fishing towns along our coast, we will gain access to a new kind of field, hidden beneath the waves, for our people to harvest. These carefully tended kelp forests full of sea slugs, clams and crustaceans as well as the fishing banks along our shore will feed our people and help satisfy our overlords' endless hunger."

 apikhoxi_no_slaves_among_us_title: "No Slaves Among Us"
 apikhoxi_no_slaves_among_us_desc: "The markets of Empkheios stain the waters of the Axehead Gulf with misery and torment. Their independence was a chance for genuine reform, yet they squandered it in their greed for profit. We have assembled our fleets and armies - they will accept our terms for abolition, or face the deserved consequences for their choices."

 apikhoxi_fertile_earth_title: "Fertile Earth"
 apikhoxi_fertile_earth_desc: "This blessed land holds more wealth in its soil than any gold mine could offer. Where others see a feral wilderness waiting to devour them, we see untamed gardens waiting to bloom. Through understanding and patience, we shall coax forth abundant gifts from the soil that would make the noble and merchant alike weep with envy."

 apikhoxi_fertile_minds_title: "Fertile Minds"
 apikhoxi_fertile_minds_desc: "Minds, like good soil, must be carefully prepared if they are to bear fruit. Our new Schools of Immigration and Agriculture will teach freed slaves and refugees not just how to farm, but how to live as free people in harmony with the land. In Gapóueion they will learn our customs and how to exist within our community, while in Apikhoxí proper they will master the sacred arts of working with the earth rather than against it. Each graduate becomes not just a farmer, but a good neighbor and citizen."

 apikhoxi_fertile_fields_title: "Fertile Fields"
 apikhoxi_fertile_fields_desc: "Our ancestors' wisdom of working with the land, not against it, has finally been codified into proper treatises, genuine treasure troves of practical knowledge. Even our nobles maintain these sacred traditions, tending experimental fields alongside common farmers. Through careful cultivation and respect for nature's rhythms, we can now coax sustenance from a soil that others would dismiss as barren."

 apikhoxi_fertile_waters_title: "Fertile Waters"
 apikhoxi_fertile_waters_desc: "The ancient philosophers spoke of the elements in harmony, and we have found the truth of their words of wisdom reflected in the subtle rhythms between fish and water, plant and soil in Lake Mteidhan. Through careful cultivation and wisdom, we have transformed the lake waters into Serigagothan - a vast emerald tapestry of life that shall sustain us all. From the halls of Geneltham's new School of Aquaculture, scholars shall learn to read these waters as others read books, preserving the delicate balance that makes such an abundant bounty possible."

 apikhoxi_spring_of_a_new_people_title: "Spring of a New People"
 apikhoxi_spring_of_a_new_people_desc: "Like seeds scattered on fertile soil, our people take root and flourish in this new home of ours. Each generation grows stronger, more adapted to this soil, more attuned to its seasons. The Apikhobhen are becoming something new - neither of the old world nor of the wild, but a people of our own making."

 apikhoxi_feast_of_the_devand_title: "Feast of the Devand"
 apikhoxi_feast_of_the_devand_desc: "In every corner of the Devand we see plenty - golden wheat fields stretching to the horizon, prized herds that make foreign kings envious, and a thousand delicacies unknown beyond our shores. From the honey-cured freshwater squid of Serigagothan to marbled beef fed on summer flowers and mountain herbs, every farmer brings their own pride and joy to the Feast of the Devand, this grand celebration. What began as a simple market festival has bloomed into a magnificent celebration of our land's bounty. The Feast of the Devand is a marvellous proof that all our power stems from the harmonious union of soil and soul."

 #Events by SecretCalder
 flavor_apikhoxi.1.t: "Form the Apikhoxí Guard"
 flavor_apikhoxi.1.d: "It was a rainy day in Apikhoxí. Heavy droplets beat a steady rhythm on the roof of the manorial veranda. Seated in his chair, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed across the town square, to a busy construction site. The workers did not mind the rain, it seemed.\n\n"You summoned me, my lord?"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] nodded and turned his head. The one who spoke was Filinara Ironhand, the steward of his army. Or his militia, rather. It was a strange surname, one given to her, since she had no surname of her own. He made a mental note to ask about it some day.\n\n"By my estimate, the barracks will be complete before month's end. You will have lodgings as befit the brave soldiers of our city. As you requested."\n\nFilinara nodded. "You will not regret this, lord."\n\n"I hope not. It would be an expensive jest, and mine masters in Ormam will take it poorly when they learn of this... guard of mine."\n\n"It is a choice that makes us all stronger. Of course they will take it poorly. Better to prepare for it."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] shook his head.\n\n"You have a fierce temper for a slave. No wonder they sent you here."\n\n"They had no use for me. It is well that you struck my chains. Their loss is your gain."\n\n"So it would seem. You promise much of this guard."\n\nThe ghost of a smile appeared on Filinara’s visage.\n\n"I do. As I am loyal to you, they will be to me. I will take those who Ormam thought had no use. They will serve this city well. This I promise you.""
 flavor_apikhoxi.1.a: "“I believe it, coming from you.”"

 flavor_apikhoxi.2.t: "Our Calmer Brothers Have an Offer"
 flavor_apikhoxi.2.d: "Fate favors our southern sibling. The Nékhei of Apikhoxí has recently thrown off the fetters of their decrepit lords in Ormam, leaving them free to pursue their own destiny. Apikhoxí straddles the mouth of the Xiktheam river, and holds dominion over the best farmlands in Devand. Therefore, it is perhaps to be expected that they have grown both wealthy and powerful since their foundation.Today, an envoy from Apikhoxí came to Besolakí, and made [Root.Monarch.GetName] an offer. They will invest in our city in general, and put their best and brightest mages at our disposal for our damestear projects. In exchange, they request our fealty. Not in the feudal sense, or so they claim, but by our recognition of their status as “first among equals” of a new league that will one day stretch across all of the Devand, according to their plans.\n\nIt is a daring request, and since we have only recently thrown off our own shackles, it would perhaps be unwise to jump from one lap to the next. Even so, Apikhoxí is closer to our home, and we have far more in common with them than with any lord of distant Alecand across the sea. Perhaps cooperation in their league is the way forward.\n\nHow shall we respond?"
 flavor_apikhoxi.2.a: "Their terms are fair. Make it so."
 flavor_apikhoxi.2.b: "We won't squander our freedom by shackling ourselves to these fools!"

 flavor_apikhoxi.3.t: "Changing the Deal"
 flavor_apikhoxi.3.d: "It was a warm day in Apikhoxí. The sun-kissed streets were crowded with people, busy with the day’s labor, or simply taking in the fair weather. An ornate goblet sailed through the air, whirling majestically and spilling droplets of purple wine on all and sundry, before shattering on the cobblestones. Some faces turned to the item's source, a window in the city hall, from which spilled loud voices, but alas no further glassware.\n\n"Your fury grows costly, Galendhos, I was fond of that goblet."\n\n"You will find the cost of your pride far greater, when Ormam puts you in fetters for this... suggestion." Galendhos, whose fair blue complexion had turned indigo with rage, glared knives at [Root.Monarch.GetName], who sipped from his as of yet surviving goblet. Then he sighed, and looked out the window.\n\n"Forgive me. T'is a... daring plan. Too daring for my blood."\n\n"Clearly."\n\n"Have a care, old fool. You may find a way to live through Ormam's ire, but I have nothing past this place. Your terms are fair, and were I the lord of Ormam, I would take them and be thankful. But these old men are spiteful, and see our rise with envy. Some would see grave insult in the mere fact of your offer."\n\n"Some." [Root.Monarch.GetName] cleared his throat. "But I still have friends in Ormam, who think much like I do. My words are penned with care, and I am confident that in the end, our noble overlords beyond the sea will see the gain in loosening our fetters. And I have faith in my peers - their greed has a fiercer grasp on their souls than their spite."\n\nA smile touched his lips. Galendhos knew it well, and he also knew that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was probably right. Probably.\n\n"Fine. Give me your bloody letter. I will be off to Ormam with the tide.""
 flavor_apikhoxi.3.a: ""And deathwind take you, if your peers take ill to this deal of yours.""

 flavor_apikhoxi.4.t: "Outgrown Our Shackles"
 flavor_apikhoxi.4.d: "It was a cold day in Apikhoxí. Bare were the streets, safe for a few mulish merchants, bedraggled clerks, and their equally stubborn patrons. Most who could, stayed inside, or huddled around guttering braziers. And today, as on any other day, the drilling chants in the guard barracks rang out across the city square, a steady song though with less of an audience than usual to pay it mind.\n\nEven [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s office had a pervasive chill to it, despite the best efforts of a diligent hearth. Iserana Zimisces, a merchant from Ormam, warmed her hands by the fire, her brow furrowed in thought.\n\n"You look thoughtful." [Root.Monarch.GetName] offered, sat behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] desk.\n\n"The message you would have me bring provokes thought. I suspect the lords of Ormam will feel much the same."\n\n"But you are no lord of Ormam."\n\n"I am a daughter of Ormam. Your break with them will do us harm. And I have built my life on trade, on taking your wares to their markets."\n\n"Then this can be no surprise to you. The wares only ever flowed from here to there."\n\n"And people from there to here. No, it is no surprise. Merely... there was a place for you, under Ormam's banner. In raising your own, you set yourselves against them. This I fathom, will not go unchallenged. But I am just a simple soul. I saw you prosper together. To me, it is presumptuous to think that now you are better off alone."\n\n"Pride, or hubris, hm?"\n\n"Yes. Pride or hubris.""
 flavor_apikhoxi.4.a: "I suppose we will soon know which..."

 flavor_apikhoxi.5.t: "East Versus West"
 flavor_apikhoxi.5.d: "A plain, overcast day found Apikhoxí warm, but not so humid as to drive the people off the streets. This was a blessing to the more conceited members of the Apikhoxí guard, who had taken to drilling in the town square. Most onlookers found the display suitably impressive, and not a day had gone by without at least some applause for their performance.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] found the backdrop of the battle-chants a suitable rhythm for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] work, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] penned [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] letters on the veranda. These were letters of war, after all. Not declarations of war, naturally - Apikhoxí was not a bellicose city. But she did have neighbors, who were being unjustly exploited by the lords of Alecand to the west. And since Apikhoxí had won her independence, it had only grown more glaring just how little real power Alecand held across the Cleaved Sea.\n\nSo [Root.Monarch.GetName] penned [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] letters, and the Apikhoxí guard drilled in the square, all in preparation for an inevitable war. They were letters bearing promises of support, to any Nékheis who could find the courage to break their bonds with Alecand, and chart a course towards a brighter future with Apikhoxí instead. For where Alecand took, Apikhoxí would give. Weapons and men to wield them, of course. But more importantly, food. For Apikhoxí had grown rich and prosperous, and any who chose her hand in friendship, would never starve again.\n\nIt was a simple promise. But, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided, far more than any lord of Alecand could offer. And more importantly, it was true. The other Nékheis knew this, as did the lords of Alecand."
 flavor_apikhoxi.5.a: "Soon, all of Devand would be free."

 flavor_apikhoxi.6.t: "In League With the Farmers"
 flavor_apikhoxi.6.d: "Fate favors our southern sibling. The Nékhei of Apikhoxí has recently thrown off the fetters of their decrepit lords in Ormam, leaving them free to pursue their own destiny. Apikhoxí straddles the mouth of the Xiktheam river, and holds dominion over the best farmlands in Devand. Therefore, it is perhaps to be expected that they have grown both wealthy and powerful since their foundation.\n\nToday, an envoy from Apikhoxí came to Eneion, and made [Root.Monarch.GetName] an offer. In exchange for our fealty, they will support our own ambitions for hegemony over the Eneionam, by military support if need be. Furthermore, they will recognize and support our claim to the isle of Serigastisi, as control of this island would benefit us both due to all the wealth and increased security of our shipping lanes this would bring us.\n\nIt is a daring request, and since we have only recently thrown off our own shackles, it would perhaps be unwise to jump from one lap to the next. Even so, Apikhoxí is closer to our home, and we have far more in common with them than with any lord of distant Alecand across the sea. Perhaps unity is the way forward.\n\nHow shall we respond?"
 flavor_apikhoxi.6.a: "Their terms are fair. Make it so."
 flavor_apikhoxi.6.b: "Absolutely not!"

 flavor_apikhoxi.7.t: "Insincere Acceptance"
 flavor_apikhoxi.7.d: "Kelodios wondered, as his callused hands put seed to soil, what sort of depraved lowlife he had been in a previous life, for fate to scorn him so. These lands had been his lands, after all. And his fathers lands before him. He knew these fields well, having spent all his years surrounded by them. And when his years were spent, he would happily rest in them.\n\nOr so Kelodios had thought. The last few years had changed everything. Not for anything he had done, for he had lived a modest life, no vices to swallow his meagre earnings. Yet the prices of grain had fallen, year after year. Imports from Devand were cheaper. Soon he had fallen into debt. Then into slavery. Now strangers kept Kelodios' hearth, and had him work in fields that were no longer his. These were bitter thoughts, yet every day it seemed, Kelodios' mind could find aught else to pass the time. \n\nIt was enough to drive a man to...\n\nA tap against his back. The overseer, and a robed woman.\n\n"You've a visitor, Kelodios." the overseer said. Then he turned his head to the guest.\n\n"Ten minutes. We've plenty of work to do." She nodded. He left. Kelodios stood up.\n\n"Kelodios? My name is Selussa. I come from the city of Apikhoxí."\n\nHe spat at the ground. Selussa smiled.\n\n"Your tale is one well known to me. I would make you an offer."\n\n"I've little to trade, Selussa. Not even time is mine to give."\n\n"No, you belong to another. But they care not for you, and would sell you to me. We have a need for folk like you in Apikhoxí, who would work the earth with us."\n\n"As a slave."\n\nSelussa shook her head, her smile gone.\n\n"We have no slaves in Apikhoxí. You would be a free man. That is why I came here. To ask you, not some... lord in the city." Selussa spoke the word "Lord" akin to a curse. Kelodios liked that. "
 flavor_apikhoxi.7.a: "“Where do I sign?”"

 flavor_apikhoxi.8.t: "We Love the Kylakas Day!"
 flavor_apikhoxi.8.d: "It was a rainy day in the Devand. Not a torrent, but a drizzle, filling the air with moisture. Many of the farmers in Apikhoxí celebrated such weather, for the Devand had long, warm summers, and a bit of rain took the edge off the heat, for both them and their crops.\n\nOne such farmer, Keladora Kelodades, was also grateful for the weather, though she was engulfed by another task. She and her brother Ivranes were assembling a great stage for the first We Love the Kylakas Day. Overseeing their toil was Selussa, who had been demoted to overseer, being plainly unfit for practical work, and a clear and persistent danger to herself and others with hammer and nails.\n\n"I do feel rather useless." she lamented.\n\n"I think you will find your use later, no? Considering you’re one of the speakers." Ivranes offered between hammer blows. \n\n"Besides, none of this would be possible without you. I don't think there's a household in sight of the Xiktheam who isn't in your debt." Keladora chimed in, her voice harder than her brother.\n\n"Dora, not thi-..."\n\n"No, I... She is right." Selussa interrupted. "I think I know every house by the riverbank. And there is a debt there, it is true. But I am not sure where it lies. Not from them to me though, this I know. I tried to help them-..."\n\n"And you did." said Ivranes.\n\n"But we resent that we needed help in the first place." Keladora hummed, scratching at her hammer with a fingernail.\n\nSelussa nodded. "And it was truly unjust that you all were driven to require it. I think that is what I need to... well, want to do here. Make a big party, something about what we are making here, not how we got here."\n\nKeladora nodded."
 flavor_apikhoxi.8.a: ""I think I like the sound of that." "

 flavor_apikhoxi.9.t: "A Sweet Proposition"
 flavor_apikhoxi.9.d: "Fate favors our southern sibling. The Nékhei of Apikhoxí has recently thrown off the fetters of their feeble overlords in Ormam, leaving them free to pursue their own destiny. Apikhoxí straddles the mouth of the Xiktheam river, and holds dominion over the best farmlands in Devand. Therefore, it is perhaps to be expected that they have grown both wealthy and powerful since their foundation.\n\nToday, an envoy from Apikhoxí came to Keyolion, and made [Root.Monarch.GetName] an offer. It is an unusual offer, to speak plainly. The usual niceties, military support, recognition for our claims to Vothelisí, but… Most interestingly, an offer of knowledge exchange, and research grants for a new field of study - Sakkharology. The scientific understanding of sugar, its cultivation and applications.\n\nIt is a daring request, and since we have only recently thrown off our own shackles, it would perhaps be unwise to jump from one lap to the next. Even so, Apikhoxí is closer to our home, and we have far more in common with them than with any lord of distant Alecand across the sea. Perhaps unity is the way forward.\n\nHow shall we respond?"
 flavor_apikhoxi.9.a: "Their terms are fair. Make it so."
 flavor_apikhoxi.9.b: "Not a sugar cube's chance in a Kaydhano!!"

 flavor_apikhoxi.10.t: "Land of Peaceful Fields"
 flavor_apikhoxi.10.d: "It was a cold day in the Devand. Brisk winds blew from the south, and a bite in the air made it a good day for people to stay inside and enjoy the company of those nearest and dearest to their heart. This was no less true in the bustling city of Apikhoxí, where the streets were busy as always, and the urgency of the people compelled by their duties to be outside was given a sharp edge, as every single one amongst their number would really rather be inside, warming their feet by the fireplace.\n\nDaerpos Ivranes Munakliades was one of these unfortunate souls, and found today especially bitter. He had made good time for this meeting, departed early, setting up a truly generous timetable for himself. Now some blockage in the street ahead had ground this entire district to a halt. The Apikhoxí guard was on site, and made an admirable showing of trying to keep knots of onlookers away from what had apparently been a wagon collision. This then had predictably devolved into a fistfight between the drivers, before becoming a more general brawl as unwary bystanders were caught up in their dispute. Ivranes huddled in his cloak, wanting nothing more than to be home. Yet he also knew that today's meeting was one of import. It was one in a series of meetings outlining and detailing the future of the league of Devand. Besolakí, Eneion, Keyolion, Empkeios... even Amgremós, those accursed pirates.\n\nAnd Apikhoxí, of course. First among equals, some would say. Ivranes would agree, but only because they had taken the first leap, and started the conversation. Not about war, or conquest of their neighbours, but about unity. Not a unity born of conformity or fear, but of listening to the tale at the core of each city... even Amgremós, and weaving them all together, into something greater. No blood, and no chains.\n\nBut peace, perhaps."
 flavor_apikhoxi.10.a: "Ivranes sighed, and looked to the sky. He was going to be late…"

 flavor_apikhoxi.11.t: "Opening the Door"
 flavor_apikhoxi.11.d: "It was a quiet day in Apikhoxí. The winds were still, the air was dry, and the weather was neither hot nor cold. Even the usually busy streets were hushed, with the hectic bustle of buyers and sellers reduced to a gentle murmur.\n\nThe silence extended to the Kylakas' office, where [Root.Monarch.GetName] was entertaining the delegate from Degakheion. The delegate in question, Filinas Rhadinos, was a merchant of substance in his home city. He was also a major slave trader, which made him uniquely useful to the Kylakas. At this moment, he was sitting, brow furrowed, reading the contract in his hand, not for the first time.\n\n"It is a peculiar contract, Kylakas. I have bought and sold kith all my life, yet never delivered them to their freedom. I daresay I should feel some professional resentment."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] shook their head, and sipped from a cup of purple wine.\n\n"Then perhaps it is time for a change in profession, hm? You have seen it with your own eyes, the rise of our fair city. There will be no room for slavers in the future we build. But liberators? That is another matter entirely."\n\nFilinas sat back in his chair, and sighed heavily.\n\n"And if your masters in Ormam discover your plot?"\n\n"Then ours will be a brief friendship. But why would they?"\n\nA pause. Filinas furrowed his brow. The silence reclaimed dominion over the room, for a time. Then he leaned forwards, and signed the document. [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled gently."

 flavor_apikhoxi.12.d: "It was a sunny day in Apikhoxí, and if one looked out from her port to sea, one would find a perfect blue sky reflected in the ocean, blue upon blue, merging on the horizon. Even the seagulls riding the gentle swell appeared to be sunbathing, the waves rolling languidly across the water in the scarce wind, only occasionally broken up by the bobbing hulls of fishing boats.\n\nUltaris peered over the side of one such boat, and found the gaunt face of a young boy with a serious stare reflected back at him. Gaunt, but less so than last time he looked. It had been a very different face, the first time he had seen these waters. Ultaris couldn't remember much before then, and in truth he didn't care to. He had lived in a city. Not Apikhoxí, this he knew. He knew he'd been hungry and cold. And then one day, he had been taken off the street, by people that he didn't know. Thinking back on this made his chest ache, so he closed his eyes, and thought of what came next. How he'd been put on a ship, with maybe fifty other children, stored in the hold like cattle. This was a better memory, but not by much. The passage a miserable affair he gladly dismissed from his thoughts.\n\nThe arrival at port had been something else, though. And the person the slaver sold him to had been different. Warmer. He had gotten washed, fed, and introduced to Shiavera. An older lady, who had asked him for his name and whether he'd like to come and live with her and hers.\n\nIt first seemed like a particularly strange dream. There had been this instinct, that Shiavera was a genuinely nice person, and not something worse. So Ultaris had gone with her, and found that she had a house, a hearth, and even a child of her own, named Tanelia. They had been a family of fishers - Well, kelp farmers in truth. Ultaris had thought it strange then, and part of him still did. But he didn't care. He had never gone hungry since, and every day he spent in the water, he felt better than the day before. It was a good life, he decided.\n\nA weathered voice called Ultaris from his thoughts. The voice of Shiavera, on her way into the water, and to the kelp fields hidden beneath the waves."

 flavor_apikhoxi.13.d: "It was inevitable. From the moment that the Nékhei of Apikhoxí began to base their realm on notions of freedom, equality, and the abolition of slavery, we were bound to be mortal enemies. At first, there was a profit to be made of course. After all, what a buyer does with their property is their business. Selling slaves into freedom is strange, but so long as the buyer pays, what is the harm?\n\nThen the raids began. Freedmen on small ships, plying our waters, ambushing our traders, and burning our plantations, leaving emptied slave huts behind. Striking the shackles of our property, and stealing our people. All with the tacit support of Apikhoxí. Perhaps we should have crushed them then. Now it is too late.\n\nThe Apikhoxí navy is outside our harbour, and their armies are at our gates. An envoy has brought [Root.Monarch.GetName] a written ultimatum, signed by the upstart village council that passes for a government in Apikhoxí.\n\nSubmit, or die.\n\nThere are more terms of course. Abolition of slavery, promises of monetary support to ease our transition. But it is an ultimatum. War, or peace.\n\nHow shall we respond?"

 flavor_apikhoxi.14.d: "It was a rainy day in Genaltham. Not a harsh rain, but a persistent one, born from thick clouds rolling in from the northern peaks of the Harbrayn-Datl. It smothered the town like a blanket, and since Genaltham was a sleepy town, this state of affairs seemed to suit the citizens just as well.\n\nThe exception to this were the hard-toiling, much-abused students of the Genaltham School of Aquaculture. This school was a public institution, built and funded by Apikhoxí and Genaltham in concert. Tuition was free, but there were examinations to be passed in order to gain admission. Seats were fought over with typical Kheionai ferocity, and though there had been no known fatalities, this did lend a certain urgency to the daily routine of the pupils. They knew, by and large, that they were expected to perform. And since they were almost all the children of new homesteaders - Rural folk with a great deal of knowledge, but little wealth - they had no intention of bringing shame to their family’s door with mere mediocrity.\n\nEboria, the philosopher of Aquaculture, was quite proud of her class. They were eager. Hungry, even, for her knowledge. She listened to the music of quills on paper, the sniffs and coughs of bodies with minds hard at work. She swore she could almost hear the brains of her students swell in their skulls. She had taken a pause in her lecture, for notes to be taken and for her voice to rest. She sipped a glass of water, and looked out through the thick glass window behind her, that made up the rear wall of her stage, and granted a panoramic view directly across lake Serigagothan, its clear waters revealing a forest of kelp, swarms of fish... The bounty of a miraculous lake, turned into the cornucopia sustaining her people. She was proud of this place.\n\nEboria cleared her throat."

 flavor_apikhoxi.15.d: "It was a windy day in Ormam. To the south and west, the sky was blue and clear. To the north and east, the sky was painted blue as well, but it was a markedly different kind of blue. Rising from the water like a wall, clouds and banks of every hue, from pastel blue to indigo, were rapidly approaching.\n\nThe Kaydhano in all its merciless glory.\n\nCaptain Amarien of the Ormami punitive fleet had ordered the fetters struck from the oarsmen, so that they might choose their end. Most had abandoned ship, either in panic, or in the knowledge that the cold embrace of the sea would be preferable to the alternative. Some brave few were splayed across the deck, having taken their own lives, or having had a friend on hand to aid them in depriving the storm of a victim. Amarien looked down at her sword, slick with the blood of her first mate, who lay crumpled by her feet. She had not expected to die this morning. Her fleet had set out to bring Apikhoxí back into the fold, by force if necessary. The weather had been fair, she had undertaken every reasonable preparation. And no one had seen the approaching Kaydhano. She smiled, despite herself. Big old thing to miss, but then again, many had probably seen the Kaydhano. But there is seeing, and there is living to speak of what you saw.\n\nCaptain Amarien turned to face the storm, and felt the wind blow in her face. She felt the innumerable pinpricks of particles, like needles in her skin. Then burning like salt beneath it. She stared up at the Kaydhano, even as her vision began to swim and darken, as she felt her eyes begin to burn. Her every nerve began to sing, as Amarien felt her body rise in revolt against her, twisting and bloating as fine blue dust settled upon her and within her. To a theoretical onlooker, it would seem that Captain Amarien collapsed quickly, her misshapen legs giving out from under her. Even her screams were soon cut short, as lungs torn ragged by the fine blue dust fell silent.\n\nPerhaps it was a quick death. Certainly it was a death. As the Ormami punitive fleet fell silent, the Kaydhano rolled west, towards Alecand..."

 flavor_apikhoxi.16.d: "It was early morning in Apikhoxí, the sun peeking above the eastern mountains to shine across the Xiktheam riverbank. It promised to be a warm, dry and pleasant day, perfectly suited to basking in the sun and enjoying the weather.\n\nThe billowing clouds of ash and smoke, rising heavily from the acres of burning fields, therefore formed a sharp contrast. Olorises watched the inferno from the relative safety of his riverboat. He had been lucky and smelled the smoke on one of his nightly walks. Olorises had always enjoyed the quiet time just before dawn, when the whole world seemed asleep. Now it seemed that others had taken the chance to make a jab at... someone. He was not quite certain who.\n\nHe knew that someone had planned this. The fire had spread too quickly for it to be an accident, and as Olorises looked to the other side of the river, he saw a similar scene unfold. Despite the water surrounding him, he felt the heat of the flames. He and his kith had been good neighbors, and had run to wake anyone they could reach. Most homesteads had made it to the river, but Olorises knew that not everyone would be so lucky.\n\n"Feels just like home, hm?"\n\nOlorises looked to his wife Iserana, and found that he admired her more than usual at this moment. He had given the warning, but she had organized the house, and it was by her word that their children had run to their neighbors. He knew that her family were Karkares from Degakheion, and it would seem that she had brought the Degabhen wit with her.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n"Hard to look at. Whole harvest's going up in smoke."\n\nIserana hummed.\n\n"I wish I could be as calm as you, Sera."\n\n"Someone struck at us. But it is easy to burn a field, and harder work to plant one. It follows that those who plant, grow stronger than those who burn." "

A good sign.\n\nOn the grain square, the city was busy as always, the murmur of innumerable people in motion interrupted unusually by the rhythmic beat of a hammer affixing nails to wood. Posters had been put up across the city, each one written by hand. An unusual occurrence, the gathering crowd observed to themselves. Most Apikhoxí could read to some extent, and in this case, a charitable soul had taken the time to read the proclamation aloud for those who could not.\n\n"Honored citizens, farmers and freedmen of Apikhoxí.\n\nIt is with great honor that the Apikhoxí Synkletos presents the newly founded Apikobhen School of History, a public institution specializing in Kheionai history, culture, and the distinction between our fair Kheion of Apikhoxí and those of our esteemed peers, in the Devand and Alecand.\n\nClasses are free of charge, but seats are limited, and examinations to determine admission will begin in seven days time in the following locations..."\n\nThe crowd murmured in approval, perhaps feeling a stirring of national pride. The idea that they were Apikhobhen and not Ormabhen was certainly a new perspective. And yet, some faces in the crowd seemed thoughtful. Some, even exasperated. "

The grain square was full to bursting, for today was an important day.\n\nThe malefactors responsible for what the historians had named "The Great Burning of the Xiktheam" had been apprehended. As soon as word reached the capital, the Apikhoxí guard had sprung into action, widely supported by the outraged civilian population. Ditches and firewalls had been dug and raised, every mage in Apikhoxí had been rallied to apply their craft, and the roaring blaze had been contained. Those who could be saved had been, and then it had simply been a case of waiting for the fires to die down.\n\nThen came the investigation, the interviews with survivors - of whom there were thankfully quite a few -, and the building of a case. Eventually, the guilty parties had been found. A gang of younger Kheionai, most of whom were men, who had been offered a large sum of money from a secretive benefactor in Alecand. A confession was given, and as the case was pursued across the Cleaved Sea, all that now remained was to determine how Apikhoxí would punish these criminals.\n\nLegally, this was difficult. The number of victims was close to a hundred, and more bodies were found every week.The damage to property was vast enough to be uncountable. As a result, every citizen of Apikhoxí agreed on a severe punishment, and the Apikhobhen were largely united and unanimous in their consensus of..."

With a smile, he passed a plate of the balls to a young child behind him, who stared wide-eyed at the food. This was for all of them, after all. \n\nThe construction of the Devand's new capital was a salute to all its peoples. Slow-cooked boar from the Mteibhar, fresh fruits from the gardens of Besolakí. Fragrant coffee at the start of the feast, to show that the Devand, too, excelled in the cultivation of the new crops arriving from Cannor. The tables groaned under a banquet open to all. At the tables of Apikhoxí there was neither lord nor slave, soldier nor farmer. Instead, this feast was open to all, where any may eat their fill. \n\nMore struggles would come in due time, of course. But the Devand would face all those struggles with open arms and open hearths. \n\nMock the sons of slaves and serfs if you wish, but if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."
