 cannor_monument_flavour.1.t:0 "The Dilapidated Court"
 cannor_monument_flavour.1.d:0 "Decades had passed since the Northern Citadel fell to the orcs during the Greentide, yet the dispersed remains of the slain Castellyrians continued to vividly depict the savagery which befell them on that fateful day. Walking through the courtyard was an act of desecration as human bones, concealed under the tall grass, crumbled and cracked with each step taken. \n\nAlthough parts of the Northern Citadel had been repaired by Castellyr, the palace, which did not serve a military purpose, had remained untouched since the Battle of Trialmount centuries ago. In the few places where light reached the ground, vegetation tightly clung to marble, providing only small glimpses of the intricate masonry and faded artwork gracing the formerly splendid court. In the dark fungi thrived, feasting off the fabric of ornate tapestries and fine cloth. \n\nOn the side of the palace facing the Trialmount rests the Great Departure Hall, from where countless aspirants to the title of Castan had ascended the mountain over the centuries to take the Trials of Castan. Those who failed are lost to history and those who succeeded were immortalized with marble statues carved into the very pillars which held up the structure. Yet, hundreds of pillars still were uncarved marble chunks, with the Great Departure Hall having been designed to accommodate a thousand statues of Castans that would rule Castanor for millennia to come. The thought had never occurred to its builders that a world without Castanor could exist. \n\nAlthough the North Citadel remains intact, the question whether any nation can restore this monument to its full potential, to a state worthy of its legacy, remains unanswered."
 cannor_monument_flavour.1.a:0 "Through diligence, the Citadel may prosper."
 cannor_monument_flavour.1.b:0 "This was once the center of one of the greatest empires, it can be so again."
 cannor_monument_flavour.1.c:0 "The Citadel is a relic of a bygone age, our efforts should be focused elsewhere."

 cannor_monument_flavour.2.t:0 "The Prosperous Duo"
 cannor_monument_flavour.2.d:0 "Castonath and the Northern Citadel were once the center of the world. From the Northern Citadel ruled generations of Castans, never disconnected from the empire they ruled as the City of World's Desire always remained in view. While Castonath prospered under the watchful gaze of the Northern Citadel, it remained safe in the knowledge that even as its cityscape changed many times since antiquity, the citadel atop the distant mountain remained constant. \n\nThe two giants' survival is a testament to their sturdiness and importance, as not all of Balgars Wonders remain. The aqueduct which once connected the Northern Citadel and Castonath lies now as a hollow shell of its former glory, with the centuries-old marble plundered by desperate scavengers and ambitious sculptors alike. While the Southern Citadel, the palace of dreams and luxury which dwarfed the opulence of rival courts across the continent has long since fallen, Castonath and the Northern Citadel stood the test of time. \n\nAlthough those glorious days are long gone, the prospect of mutual prosperity between the Northern Citadel and Castonath has once again become an achievable goal. For the first time since the chivalric kingdoms, our state possesses the resources to restore some fragments of Castanor’s magnificence."
 cannor_monument_flavour.2.a:0 "Focus on the imperial court of the North Citadel."
 cannor_monument_flavour.2.b:0 "The two are inseparable, invest in both equally."
 cannor_monument_flavour.2.c:0 "Castonath has always been Escann’s crown jewel, it should be treated as such."

 cannor_monument_flavour.3.t:0 "The Northern Citadel, Heart of Conquest"
 cannor_monument_flavour.3.d:0 "Since the earliest days of Castanor, the Northern citadel has served three primary functions. The first function was as an impenetrable fortification which ensured that supplies flowed into Castonath even under siege; those who wished to take the city would first need to conquer the goliath fortress atop the mountain. Its second function was as the heart of Castanor, a lofty place of tranquility from which the Castans managed their vast empire. \n\nSince it fell into decay centuries ago, all those who knew of the Northern Citadel’s third function and old colloquial name have long since passed away. Yet with our restoration of the citadel to its former glory and the war room reawakening, people shall know the name ‘Citadel of Conquest’ once more. \n\nGenerals and members of the court now congregate around a topographical map of Escann and Cannor, with scale models of the Walls of Castanor and all of Balgar’s wonders built with exquisite detail. Every military detail - regardless of significance - is updated daily and marked with stone pieces representing armies, navies, and fortifications. Junior officers keep track of friendly and hostile logistics routes; meticulously mapping out the routes of supply trains that must follow our armies in case of war, while also keeping track of the enemy's logistical situation so our generals may never be surprised during their campaign. Bureaucrats burn into their mind the landscape they will govern, while cartographers painstakingly create hundreds of meticulously detailed maps so that no leader is left blind to the peculiarities of their environment. No detail escapes the scrutiny of the war room, for if the old adage ‘information is power’ is true, then there is no mightier place in Halann than the war room."

 cannor_monument_flavour.4.t:0 "The Mages Within"
 cannor_monument_flavour.4.d:0 "‘When does a mage flourish?’ \n\nAn imprisoned mage stumbles through the maze-like structure of Bal Vertesk, desperately looking for a way out. Knowing he can’t waste his one shot of freedom he doesn’t stop to ponder why his room had such a convenient escape route to begin with. \n\n                                                            ***\n\nAn inmate hangs from a noose with just enough clearance that the tips of his toes touch the ground. He struggles for air standing on the tips of his toes until his muscles give in and he endures suffocation for agonizing moments until he can rally his strength to once again stand upon his toes. The cycle repeats hundreds of times as the mage slowly suffocates over the course of hours.  \n\nSubject failed to conjure an elemental servant to free himself. Test unsuccessful. \n\n‘When does a mage flourish?’ \n\nA couple of caged starving rats are placed directly upon an inmate's bare chest. As the rats begin to feast upon his skin and flesh the mage screams in ever increasing agony. Yet the exterior of his body proves to be insufficient sustenance for the ravenous vermin and as the mage feels a rat burrow into his body he finally faints. \n\nSubject failed to enchant a couple of lowly rats. Test unsuccessful. \n\n‘When does a mage flourish?’ \n\n                                                            ***\n\nHours of wandering later the inmate unknowingly turns the final corner, yet he is not greeted with freedom but by the sight of men adorned with the crest of the Magisterium. The most ornately dressed man speaks in a cold emotionless tone: ‘Subject escaped the maze without the help of his divination magic. Test inconclusive, Re-administer the test.The ground rumbles as the maze walls begin to shift, the escapee frantically running towards the closing gap but failing to make it in time. His desperate plea for mercy echo throughout the maze but it is of no use. \n\nSubject failed to use divination magic to escape the maze. Test unsuccessful."

 cannor_monument_flavour.5.t:0 "Vertesk, City of Eternal Vision"
 cannor_monument_flavour.5.d:0 "People tolerated them in the beginning, seduced as they were by the alluring promise of greater safety and security provided by the artificial eyes floating above them. Yet what started as a few observers aimlessly flying around in search of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, increased in ever greater numbers even as crime vanished. \n\nEven as the sound of fluttering wings grew omnipresent people still overlooked their presence, after all the flying eyes only tracked criminals and if you had nothing to hide you had nothing to worry about. \n\nSeemingly innocent families were suddenly torn apart and disappearances continued to grow, yet the eyes continued to swarm out of the Black Tower. The artificers’ invention had removed the cover of darkness, rendering sun and moon indistinguishable. The extermination of crime was not their true objective, but a convenient consequence of the security apparatus which scrutinised every second of the lives of the Vertesker citizenry. \n\nAny wrong word, any suspicious movement, any incriminating emotions, any perceived dissidence and the eyes would latch onto your every move until your eventual disappearance. Not a moment of reprieve is afforded from this unceasing surveillance. There is no salvation, only conformity, the new normal must be embraced not because it is just, but because it is a prerequisite for your survival."
 cannor_monument_flavour.5.a:0 "The light is the night’s answer to the looming shadow of the day."

 cannor_monument_flavour.6.t:0 "Marshes and Will-O’-Wisp"
 cannor_monument_flavour.6.d:0 "Bodies preserved beneath the marsh for centuries peer out from beneath the swampy water, their glassy eyes peering into the sky forevermore. Their souls cling on to the world with rage, festering with malice as they seek a revenge they cannot obtain. Yet the magic of the one they hate lingers on, allowing the souls to pervert the landscape little by little. When a sufficient number of souls converge, they intertwine corpses, flora, and mud into a shambling abomination, for a while acting upon their fury with this vessel they have merged into, only to then disintegrate back down into their constituent parts. This cycle continues until the souls have lost all concept of who they once were, a void filled only with rage. Once cleansed of their mortal past, an abomination which only knows rage is born and roams the marshes seeking an enemy they no longer recall. \n\nBal Mire was once one of the greatest fortifications in Cannor until Zaamalot the Black burned down the fortress and made it his lair. Centuries after his death the lands surrounding Bal Mire remain tainted by an unknown magic which only powerful mages may cleanse. The influx of settlers, however, precipitates a novel approach as even if a patch of land is purified, if the village is wiped out the marsh will consume what it has been forced to give up for a while. \n\nBal Mire itself is not tainted by this corrupting magic and if rebuilt can become an oasis of tranquillity from whence the reclamation of the surrounding bogland can truly begin."
 cannor_monument_flavour.6.a:0 "Bal Mire holds immense potential. It must be rebuilt in all its glory!"
 cannor_monument_flavour.6.b:0 "Dangers loom in the marshes, but rebuilding the fortress is worth it."
 cannor_monument_flavour.6.c:0 "The marshes of Balmire are of little value to us."

 cannor_monument_flavour.7.t:0 "Adapting to unsettling life"
 cannor_monument_flavour.7.d:0 "There is a certain tranquility that Bal Mire brings to otherwise brutish marshlands. Within a sea of perilous marshes it represents a beacon of hope, a testament to how the indomitability of will can persevere even in the most hostile landscapes. Although abominations continue to lurk in the marshes and wretched souls contort the landscape to trap unsuspecting victims, with sufficient experience the darkness of the marshes can be traversed. \n\nEven as growing numbers of settlers continue to establish their homes within the shadow of Bal Mire, there is still much work to be done. If our progress is any sign of what we can accomplish, one day those restless souls will finally be put to rest and these tainted marshlands shall be freed from the grasp of twisted silence."
 cannor_monument_flavour.7.a:0 "The light of Bal Mire comforts all."
