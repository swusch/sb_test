 z18_fridas_preaching_desc:0 ""It was one of the few times that Brasûr was not off on some campaign – crushing dissenters and ensuring loyalty – that the discussion took place. Well, I say discussion… Most discussions between the two were icy at best, and full blown arguments at worst. This was more an argument, about what he had heard of Frida's preaching about Esmaryal. Causing concern amongst the tribes, demanding she stop. She fired back, saying that he wasn't just the warchief of Gray Orcs anymore - and besides, he couldn't deny that her work was helping the burden of governance…\n\nSo that's why you're seeing more of those priests of Esmaryal about. What do I make of it? I'm just the queen's bodyguard, I'm no theologian, unlike her… But I must say, the priests have done a lot to help. We share this land now, much as some on either side are bothered by that, so we got to respect each other." \n -Bosun Bloodbite, Frida's bodyguard, recorded in 'Tales of the Graytide"

 z18_our_new_avatar_desc:0 ""Esmaryal was created to care for the gods. She was born so that they might have a mother looking after them, providing for them and seeing to their needs. She has cared for us, provided us with the warmth of the hearth, the bounty of the harvest, and the joy of starting our own families. Her purpose is to provide for the Gods and for us, and for that, we worship her.\n\nFrida did much the same for us. As a mother gives of her womb, she rebuilt our homes, so that our hearths may burn once more. As a mother gives of her milk, she cleared our fields, so the crops may grow again. And as a mother gives of her blood, she showed us all the sacrifices she was willing to make for her family. She cared not for herself, only for her people. She gave her body to Brasûr, that we might find peace. And she stayed her brother's hand so that peace could be maintained.\n\nHow can one learn of her and not recognize an Avatar of Esmaryal?"\n-Sermon delivered by a priest of the House of Comfort"

 z18_cult_of_the_gentle_dawn_desc:0 ""When we half-orcs came of age, there were but two choices before us - we could join the military, as many did, bolstering the ranks and earning our place via war. Or, we could remain in the Cult that raised us, and become its servants and priests. Though I chose the latter, and my sister the former, we both still carried the teachings of the Cult of the Gentle Dawn with us. Where I converted via care and teaching, she proved our strength in the crucible of war.\n\nThus through us the cult spread, first to our fellow half-orcs, and then to our orcish parents and siblings. Many chose for pragmatic reasons - our temple provided for them, gave them care where it was needed and services when required. But I like to believe there was a deeper conviction, too - that they had entered a new land, and that they must find a new faith to suit it."\n-From the Journals of Morik Mintirley, Priest of Esmaryal"

 z18_embrace_new_gods_title:0 "Embrace New Gods" #Palks
 z18_embrace_new_gods_desc:0 "As our rule has stabilized and our people adapted to life alongside the White Reachmen, we have had to adopt new cultural practices and ways of thinking. This has not remained limited to matters of dress and style; the Cult of the Gentle Dawn, espousing Esmaryal and her virtues, has spread rapidly across our lands. The Cult's message has cut across species lines, with Reachmen, orc, and half-orc alike following the cult and its teachings.\n\nThis has put Brasûr and his closest advisors in an awkward position, made even more awkward by Frida's constant demands that he give his official patronage to the church. But now that the Cult is entrenched and the Old Dookanites hold little power, the time seems ripe to proclaim the Regent Court as our faith. While it will cause issues amongst those who still follow the old ways, it shall help us to integrate with the Cannorians and have them accept us as something more than monstrous invaders."

Even with this, I have not suffered as much as others have. Our people have been put through the hardships of war - injury and loss of family, the loss of their homes, the deprivation of their livelihoods. Though it has been more than a decade since the Graytide, our people still suffer.\n\nBut they shall no longer. Esmaryal has provided me with a goal, to found the House of Comfort. Together, under her guidance, we shall bring peace and unity to these lands. We shall care for the new children of this changed kingdom. So that even if we face renewed conflict and suffering returns, those that follow will know peace in the loving embrace of Esmaryal."\n-Text attributed to Frida Vrorensson, in the archives of the High Temple of the Gentle Dawn"

Unfortunately, being consigned to farming feels to many orcs like a great dishonor, the stripping of warrior's rights. In the guise of compassion, Brasûr has hit upon a plan: orcs injured in battle will be granted plots of land to work, or Moskaran, starting with the marginal but promising forests of Southern Vrorenwall.\n\nMany will still object to the dishonor being forced on them, preferring the doomed honor raids which were the traditional lot of maimed orcs, but the clever Warchief has every confidence they will become accustomed to the comfort in time. Such wounded warriors may yet serve to form the basis of a new orcish aristocracy."

His doomed attempt at restoring the Vrorenmarch has failed. While pockets of resistance amongst the rebellious Reachmen who joined the usurper are still being dealt with, the bulk of his armies have surrendered and the rest have fled back across the water to Adshaw.\n\nBreaking with the typical orcish traditions, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been persuaded by our loyal Reachmen subjects to show some degree of clemency. While the ringleaders of the rebellion have been swiftly executed for treason, the troops that simply followed their Lord's orders into battle have been allowed to live – on one condition. Each of them must individually swear an oath of loyalty to the Warchief of Frozenmaw. If the Reachmen claim to take their values of honor seriously, then such oaths shall be sufficient in subduing any further rebellious thoughts. And if they are not, then the fear of the potential consequences of another rebellion will perfectly suffice.\n\nThe victory against this insurrection has garnered great legitimacy for Frozenmaw in the eyes of the Reachmen, by terror if not by respect. With stability now ensured in the Reach, our ambitions can start turning to the vast lands in the east."

In the south, along the frontier with Escann, where goblin bandits once freely burnt crops and fields, stand forts and outposts proudly flying the banner of Frozenmaw, filled with loyal and experienced warriors who guard our heartlands from Escanni ambitions. In the east, within the vast untamed wilderness of the Northern Pass, explorers map the lands and mark prospective locations for new settlements. In the numerous orcish tribal camps and settlements, newly erected shrines of Esmaryal preach Frida's word to the converted as orcs from all walks of life embrace the Cannorian religion. And in the great cities of the Reach, once stagnant from internal conflicts, humans, orcs, and half-orcs alike, who all live together in peace and work towards a shared future.\n\nBrasûr's ambition has been realised. In Bal Vroren, a council has been called with key leaders of the Reachmen nobility, orcish tribal chiefs, and the newly formed half-orc noble class. All parties agree that the rulers of Frozenmaw are now the legitimate rulers over the former lands of Vrorenmarch. Yet the transformation of the Reach under the stewardship of Frozenmaw necessitates a new outlook on what kind of state we rule. While such debates take place, one thing is clear. The prestige and recognition we have gained has earned us our place amongst the kings and queens of Cannor. No longer shall we in Frozenmaw be ruled by a mere tribal chief. Instead, a new king, a Gray King, shall lead us forward into prosperity!"

It stood untested for over a century, when it was partially ruined by invading giants, then restored again by the last giant, Kranmas the Chained.\n\nIn subsequent centuries, Bal Vroren would serve as a staging ground for Castanorian pacification of the north, a home for Dragonwake refugees, and, briefly, a roost for Elkaesal. This last occupation of the legendary citadel left it wreathed in magical ice and filled with corpses, and with a lasting reputation as cursed ground.\n\nNow, our conquest of Vrorenmarch has left us the stewards of the citadel, or more accurately, of its rubble. We should secure our legitimacy, and our capital, by restoring the citadel to its former glory. More to the point, who knows what treasures may turn up in the ruins?"

One by one the kingdoms fell, each victory making more of our own people question whether it was truly the right choice not to follow Korgus' call. Yet they say that patience is a virtue, and ours certainly has paid off. For the false prophet lies dead, slain by a human god – if the rumors are to be believed. The once united horde of our indoctrinated Green Orc relatives lies shattered and warring tribes now fight for the scraps of a devastated land.\n\nIn the chaos that has followed Korgus' death, many former goblin slaves have also amalgamated into their own clans and settled across Escann. Two of these clans exist along our southern borders: the Hideguzzler Clan in the Gulletpeak Mountains and the Headwearer Clan along the northern bank of the River Alen. Aside from the nuisance raids on our southern farms that have drummed up support for military action, word has now reached us of numerous so-called "adventurer bands" warring amongst the tribes and clans in an effort to re-establish human rule over Escann. We must conquer and subjugate the goblins to establish a defensive march and better protect our heartlands against the ambitions of these would-be adventurer kings."

 z18_crush_the_traitors_title:0 "Crush the Traitors" #Pakman
 z18_crush_the_traitors_desc:0 "Despite the masterful efforts of Warchief Brasûr, the Gray Orcs still stand divided. Following the failed rebellion of 1435 - 1440, the surviving traitor clans of Broken Jaw and Doombringer retreated east into the Giant’s Tears. Since then, the clans have been a thorn in our side. Both human and orcish messengers from our villages bordering the Giant's Tears have reported a new, lethal kind of raid: traitor orcs who emerge from the forests, strike fast, and then disappear before any local militias can respond.\n\nOur orcish chiefs have already begun preparing their hosts and are eager to crush these traitors once and for all. The human nobles of the Reach are, unsurprisingly, less enthusiastic. However, some have been swayed to our side by the claim engendered by Brasûr's union with Frida Vrorensson, and many more by practicality: they prefer the Gray Orcs inhabiting their ancestral lands be beholden to an orc whose excesses they at least understand. A few token baronetcies promised on the Chillsbay coast to eager human lordlings have sufficed to cover the balance of enthusiasm needed to see their hosts support our own. Soon the Gray Orcs will no longer be fractured and the Frozenmaw Clan will lead our people united under one banner."

 z18_ruins_of_an_empire_desc:0 "The Alcarssons of Eskerborg have in their possession several sets of a strange looking armor which shines and deflects blade attacks unlike any other armor we have seen. When pressed on how they came to possess such valuable equipment, they shared with us some of their ancestral tales. Centuries ago, they were once subjects to an ancient dynasty of reaver-kings from the north. These so-called "Ebonfrosts" were not only lords over the Reach but in fact were the final rulers of the fabled human empire of Castanor. After the empire fell – in the wake of a devastating war of magic and sorcery – the surviving Ebonfrosts retreated north to their ancestral homelands in the Urviksten Mountains, where they established a rump-state that remains to this day. According to the Alcarssons, that is where forges still supposedly produce these strange sets of armor, smithing them from a material they call "Ebonsteel".\n\nOur warriors and chiefs are eager to launch an invasion of Urviksten to seize more of this Ebonsteel armor and weaponry. To the leaders of the Frozenmaw clan however, the objective is clear. History will have it be known that the final dynasty of Castanor was not snuffed out by mere petty squabbles amongst the Reachmen and Gerudians. Instead, the Gray Orc people will be remembered by all of Cannor as the ones who conquered the final holdout of the ancient empire."

If humans are good and orcs are bad, then what am I?\n\nWhy did Mama and Papa marry if their people are enemies? I know it wasn't for love, as they're never together. I ponder this.\n\nWhen Nanny arrives, she tells me that soon, all this will change. A man will come to make things right again and put people like Mama in their place again. She says I shouldn’t worry – that despite having their blood, he'll treat me well.\n\nMama says to tell her if anyone says anything bad about orcs, or anything treasonous about Cousin [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Will the man still treat me well if I'm loyal to [Root.Monarch.GetName]?"

The sight below him was enough to bring a satisfied smile to his face. The shipyards were brimming with activity as hundreds of newly acquired goblin laborers worked under the watchful eyes of orcs and their Reachmen construction advisors. As overseer of the Sarmozd shipyards, his job was about to get a lot busier.\n\n“You called for me, Chief?” – the voice of Borba Deadeye, Takra’s lieutenant, somewhat breathless from the climb, issues from behind him. Without breaking sight of the shipyards, Takra responded. “Admiral Droga has requested no less than three dozen new raiding vessels to be sea-worthy by the next full moon. I do not intend to disappoint. However, as you can see, we will need more labor if we are to succeed.”\n\nBorba hesitated for a moment. “Chief, the tribal council in Bal Vroren has repeatedly said no to our requests for more goblins. They say that-”\n\n“Then call in some favors,” Takra interrupted. “I personally know some of the chiefs who subdued the goblins in Gulletpeak. I can assure you that there is plentiful goblin labor available. We will need hundreds more for this project. So I suggest you don't waste any more time and get to work.”\n\nBorba nodded and left the overseer where he was standing. Takra continued his observations. One way or another, the goblins would earn their place in this new society. But for now, Takra would ensure that the price for their freedom would be paid in full."

No one has seen him using a weapon, he has never taken part in raids, he looks older than his age – and frail at that. But what he lacks in physical strength, he makes up for with the gift of a silver tongue and the capacity to read people. He speaks little and prefers to listen, but a handful of his words have solved dozens of conflicts within the clans. He has ended deadly feuds that spanned centuries in just one afternoon, with all sides somehow happy with the outcome.\n\nPerhaps, then, Bakram Winterwind is a new kind of Orc: his fights happen not on the field of battle but in the fields of politics and diplomacy, where he can show his ability. Though a Shaman, he has dedicated little time to the religious rituals, preferring to get into the problems of the material world, and as Chief Shaman, this attitude has begun to rub off on Brasûr, who now entertains the idea of giving other faiths equal weight to the Dookanism of his forefathers."

The smith's habitual gray robes lay empty on the ground; they disgorged puffs of snow when cautiously booted aside. Atop the robes sat the source of the cold: a sheathed blade with a scroll wrapped around the hilt.
