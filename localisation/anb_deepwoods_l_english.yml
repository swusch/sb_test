 I45_cluster_1_title:0 "Lake Grove"
 I45_cluster_1_desc:0 "The Silent Lake of Clan Elyn has long been known as one of the most tranquil groves, at least along the shores. Elynáyle, the traditional capital has long been a place for elves to live out nostalgic memories of days in the remnant fleet. Its inhabitants have long spent their days sailing across the placid waters and fishing the bountiful waters to their hearts' content. Despite what one would expect of the Fey Forest, the open waters of the lake itself hold no significant threats to life or limb.\n\nThe southern shore is noted for a swampier character, with looming mangrove-like leviathans towering from the waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the open waters. The southernmost part of the grove, near Sáwelahain has long been a goblin stronghold, though the lake's shore has remained elven since the initial conquests."
 I45_cluster_2_title:0 "Mountain Grove"
 I45_cluster_2_desc:0 "The Mountain Grove of Clan Myna has long been appreciated as the one place where the land pierces the heavens, breaks free from the oppressive darkness of the forest's canopies. Their proud mountain home is carved from the caves in which the frightened elves, trapped within the forest first sheltered. Its caverns and slopes hold numerous hand-hewn dwellings that have been continuously inhabited for nearly the whole of the elves' tenure in the wood.\n\nThe Myna have long stood as a beacon of the Wood Elves' culture, above the rest in both valor and elevation. The woods of the grove are largely unremarkable, more peaceful than most thanks to their proximity to the forest's edge. Though it should be minded, "peaceful" may be quite a different measure in the Deepwoods."
 I45_cluster_3_title:0 "Thorn Grove"
 I45_cluster_3_desc:0 "The Thorngrove of Drennen lies at the center of the Deepwoods. It stands as perhaps the most overtly menacing part of the forest. While brambles and spines are nothing unusual in any part of the wood, even the trees take on a warped and thorny appearance this deep in the groves. While quite thoroughly cleansed of goblins and other rivals to the elves, the region was perhaps one of the most tightly held by the Fey. The spirits' sway has long been quite firm with pathways, and even whole villages seeming to phase in and out of the material plane on a whim."
 I45_cluster_4_title:0 "Bone Grove"
 I45_cluster_4_desc:0 "The Bone Grove has long been the home of Clan Cenág, one of the least numerous but tightest knit of the elves' clans. Though every wood elf quickly learns to navigate the tangle of roots and ferns that make up the Deepwood's paths, in the Bone Grove, they are forced to also learn to keep their balance when discarded femurs and tibias are added to that mix, and to mind the dens of bones and skulls at the center of many a clearing. Despite the danger of the bone-hoarders that inhabit these strange dwellings, this grove also has long held one of the greatest concentrations of goblins remaining in the forest."
 I45_cluster_5_title:0 "Flower Grove"
 I45_cluster_5_desc:0 "A name like the "Flower Grove" would surely put the mind at ease… Wouldn't it be one of the loveliest of the wood? With those softly glowing bulbs lending it light, with the vibrant colors of the ever-blooming flowers. The Scotha would call it lovely indeed. But who doesn't adore their home? Few others would, as the flowers were important enough to earn the grove's name only thanks to the great danger they pose.\n\nEvery inhabitant of the grove need make themselves a botanist, perhaps even an alchemist for the ease with which one could find danger in its beautiful flora. From friendly-looking fruits that can rot the gut, to pollens that set all manner of strange hazes over the mind, even a poorly judged step can find thorns filled with Cannor's most potent toxins ripping through the sole of a traveler's boot."
 I45_cluster_6_title:0 "Hunter's Grove"
 I45_cluster_6_desc:0 "The Hunter's Grove is home to the mightiest, most twisted beasts of the Deepwoods. Those who dare to try and tame it soon grow into warriors that rival even the forest's orcish invaders in their might. Providing they survive, of course. Home to Clan Fealgarn, the grove provides perhaps the most sporting hunts in all of Cannor. The giant malformed pets of the Fey crash through the woods, splintering the ancient trees as they stalk their prey with venomous claws, with rows of teeth so numerous that one could hardly take count before they're taken into them. "
 I45_cluster_7_title:0 "Arrow Grove"
 I45_cluster_7_desc:0 "The Arrow Grove of the Ayeth's exact etymology is disputed. Is it for the fine wood employed in the crafting of arrows? Or is it the fact that arrows have long been the only reliable weapon, when a single misstep upon the treacherous ground could send one plunging to their demise? The limestone caverns beneath this part of the wood have eroded the forest floor into a maze of caverns, tunnels and gullies too treacherous for navigation.\n\nIt's far safer to traverse the canopy, bounding through the branches, swinging along vines, than to risk the treacherous maze below, where one misstep could send you down as long a fall as one from the canopy to firm ground. Even most of the Fey are reticent to trespass the treacherous earth of the grove, for the horrors that lurk beneath it promise some of the most torturous fates that the natural world offers outside the Effelai Jungle."
 I45_cluster_8_title:0 "River Grove"
 I45_cluster_8_desc:0 "Perhaps the most sincerely tranquil and pleasant of the groves, at least in days past, the River grove Ahain was, until the coming of the Greentide, a rare bastion of natural harmony in the Deepwoods. Elves, goblins, and some of the Woods' most prominent populations of satyr lived peacefully side by side. It is even rumored that a few remaining ancestors of the centaurs had been sighted living peacefully there, from time to time.\n\nThe region long held some of the least ireful of the Fey, resulting in the land's disposition to groves of bountiful fruits, and rivers teeming with an abundance of fish, around which most settlements were clustered. As the forest recovers from the orcish assault, one can only pray that this peace and abundance might return."
 I45_cluster_9_title:0 "Shadow Grove"
 I45_cluster_9_desc:0 "Ghul, the Shadow Grove. Home to the clan of that name, this remote corner of the forest had long been the black sheep of the Deepwoods. Shaded by the embrace of the Serpentspine's towering peaks on two sides, and an impenetrably thick canopy of black leaves above, the region was pitch black, with even the Jorkad river's headwaters wholly shaded in their flow, not a ray of light to be seen along its desperately rushing waters.\n\nThe grim elves of Ghul are rumored not only to appease the Unseelie, in their perversions and dark whimsy, but even to take travelers in appeasement of the viciously misanthropic Ashentree Fey, their dark practices a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."
 I45_securize_the_border_title:0 "Secure the Border"
 I45_securize_the_border_desc:0 "Following the emergence of the Greentide, many of the gladeways leading into the Deepwoods were abandoned. We must remedy this by establishing control over the outward paths. In doing so, we will ensure the safety and security of the Deepwoods from other potential outside invaders."
 I45_the_oak_guard_title:0 "The Oak Guard"
 I45_the_oak_guard_desc:0 "Having assumed control of the outer gladeways, we should re-institute the Oak Guard. This unit will maintain a constant vigilance upon the paths leading into the Deepwoods, thus ensuring that our lands will be adequately defended from any who would dare try to trespass into our wooded homeland."
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_title:0 "Cyranvar Renaissance"
 I45_cyranvar_renaissance_desc:0 "The decision to improve the capital has proven providential. Even now, throngs of traders and other peoples from across Cannor have begun to engage with our realm en masse. We should ensure that this engagement will be beneficial for the state by adopting any of the customs or institutions that the outside world has innovated upon."
 I45_develop_infrastructure_title:0 "Develop Infrastructure"
 I45_develop_infrastructure_desc:0 "The destruction wrought by the Greentide has left the Deepwoods devastated. If we are to having any hope of creating a state capable of withstanding the threats that surround us, we must reverse this. Develop the realm so that our ancestors might be proud, and our enemies wary of thinking about thoughts of invasion!"
 I45_promote_education_title:0 "Promote Education"
 I45_promote_education_desc:0 "The ever-growing needs of the state require an almost inexhaustible amount of well educated bureaucrats. In order to ensure that our population is able to fill this demand, we will establish institutes of higher learning throughout Cyranvar."
 I45_only_the_best_title:0 "Only the Best"
 I45_only_the_best_desc:0 "Our decision to pursue a policy of enforced isolation is predicated on maintaining a highly elite standing army. While everyone is expected to undergo military training so that they might be called up in times of dire need, only the best among us are fit to serve in the standing army. This ensures that we have a serious military edge over our rivals, but this also means that filling our ranks to replace our fallen soldiers is difficult."
 I45_a_safe_country_title:0 "A Safe Country"
 I45_a_safe_country_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing policy of isolation, leading figures in our military establishment have called for the adoption of a strategy of preemptive engagement. They argue that striking beyond our borders to quell rising threats is superior to a policy of reactive defensiveness. The veracity of their argument has struck a chord with the High King. We must crush whatever threats emerge before they can harm our homeland!"
 I45_the_model_elf_title:0 "The Model Elf"
 I45_the_model_elf_desc:0 "In deciding to pursue isolation, our state has needed to thoroughly educated the populace about the benefits of this. Part of this education is rooted in a policy of mandatory service, known colloquially as the "Model Elf" program. Our citizens know that only by being wholly devoted to Cyranvar will the state prosper,and the security of the country be preserved. This ensures that we enjoy certain economic and military benefits that most states lack."
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_title:0 "Demand the Oak Oath"
 I45_demand_the_oak_oath_desc:0 "The destruction of the orcish invaders has put us in the position of foremost prominence among the remaining Wood Elven states. We shall demand an oath of fealty from the remaining Kings in order to unite our people for the first time in history. Any who might foolishly decline this generous offer will be brought to heel by force."
 I45_a_capital_city_title:0 "A Capital City"
 I45_a_capital_city_desc:0 "As Cyranvar coalesces into a true state, our capital is sorely lacking compared to the other great cities of Cannor. If we are to truly assume a new found position of importance, we must renovate the capital to reflect the future orientation of our glorious state."
 I45_toward_the_future_title:0 "Toward the Future"
 I45_toward_the_future_desc:0 "The unification of the Deepwoods and the establishment of the Oak Monarchy affords our King the unique opportunity of deciding upon the direction of the Wood Elven people. Hardliners among us advocate for a policy of strict isolation to ensure that something like the Greentide will never happen again. Those with more liberal attitudes see the wonders that Cannor has to offer and argue for the adoption of a more open policy. Both directions will have serious consequences for the future of Cyranvar, choose wisely eminence!"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_title:0 "Remember the Fallen"
 I45_remember_the_fallen_desc:0 "As Cyranvar continues to develop, we mustn't ever forget our ancestors. Through their selfless sacrifice were our people saved. If not for them, then the Greentide would have destroyed us. As the kingdom develops we must commemorate their bravery through great works erected in their honour."
 I45_economic_boom_title:0 "Economic Boom"
 I45_economic_boom_desc:0 "Food on every table! Our economic policies have proven to be a resounding success. The economy has reached levels of prosperity we thought impossible, and the state will greatly benefit from this!"
 I45_silvar_ishu_title:0 "Silvar Ishu"
 I45_silvar_ishu_desc:0 "In choosing to isolate ourselves from Cannor, we have come to develop a relationship rooted in equilibrium with the Deepwoods. All of the actions of our Kingdom are rooted in respecting the limits and boundaries of our forested homeland. This has greatly deepened our ties with the feys and spirits of the land, who have taken to calling us the "Silvar Ishu" or Children of the Forest."
 I45_to_another_forest_title:0 "To Another Forest"
 I45_to_another_forest_desc:0 "In the last thousand plus years, elvenkind in the Deepwoods has never seen such prosperity. With wealth this comes new ambitions. New desires to push boundaries. Such boldness has led one adventurer to a place no elf has been... the heart of the Deepwoods."
 I45_under_the_canopy_title:0 "Under the Canopy"
 I45_under_the_canopy_desc:0 "Beneath the shadowed canopy of the Deepwoods, our people thrive! Centuries have passed since the devastation of the Greentide, yet thanks to our beneficent rule, Cyranvar is now the envy of Cannor. Our economy is burgeoning, trade continues to blossom and none would dare to challenge our military might! Never again shall the Wood Elves suffer under the yoke of foreign invaders, for we have assumed our rightful position among the peoples of the world!"
 I45_toward_unification_title:0 "Toward Unification"
 I45_toward_unification_desc:0 "While Cyranvar is by far the most dominant realm in the Deepwoods, we have yet to exert full control over our homeland.

 I45_a_united_deepwoods_title:0 "United Deepwoods"

 I45_the_keys_to_rule_title:0 "The Keys to Rule"
 I45_the_keys_to_rule_desc:0 "With the progression of time, and the evolution of political and cultural attitudes, our state now finds itself at a crossroads. Serious division has arisen among the people over the nature of the Oak Monarchy. Some advocate for the High King to assume a position of absolute authority, ensuring that the state remains strong. Other suggests that a parliament or some other delegative body be established, lessening the power of the King and handing over authority to elected officials. They argue that this would ensure the monarch remains legitimate, and will allow for the development of a more dynamic state. Regardless of the direction the King chooses, a decision must be made now."
 I45_develop_artisanat_title:0 "Develop Artisanat"
 I45_develop_artisanat_desc:0 "In choosing to pursue a policy of openness, we must ensure that our economy doesn't become dominated by our neighbours. To avert this potential economic slavery, the kingdom will intervene wherever necessary to ensure the development of a strong, thriving Cyranvar no matter the cost."
 I45_centralize_money_printing_title:0 "Centralize Money Printing"
 I45_centralize_money_printing_desc:0 "Our policy of supporting the Artisanat has been a resounding success. Yet despite this, private money suppliers exert an undue influence upon our economy which is a growing concern. We must exert our control by becoming the sole supplier of currency. This will ensure that money continues to flow, though we may run into some challenges..."
 I45_one_of_many_title:0 "One of Many"
 I45_one_of_many_desc:0 "In pursuing a policy of openness, our people have come to value trade and production above all else. As a result, the influence exerted by the mercantile classes has led to a qualitative change upon our culture, this is most evident in military affairs. In times of war, all are expected to serve and to do their duty, yet no room is afforded for bravado or individual greatness. Every soldier is but one of many."
 I45_expert_artisan_title:0 "Expert Artisans"
 I45_expert_artisan_desc:0 "The skill of our artisans is incomparable. Nowhere across Cannor can one find individuals of comparable quality. The Artisans have proven to be a resounding success, as the future generations are able to continue to improve upon the skills inherited from their masters."
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_title:0 "The Cosmopolitan Elf"
 I45_the_cosmopolitan_elf_desc:0 "Our ancestors traditions proved incapable of adapting to the rapidly changing world around us. In seeking to open our borders and engage with the continent at large, our economy has thrived and a more egalitarian society has developed. No longer shall any individual feel beholden to time honoured traditions. Instead we are a truly cosmopolitan people, willing and able to adopt the best practices of all cultures."
 I45_internal_trade_title:0 "Internal Trade"
 I45_internal_trade_desc:0 "The opening of the Deepwoods has seriously hindered our ability to profit from the fruits of our labour. If we are to have any hope of seeing trade thrive in our land, we must limit the ability of foreign merchants to exploit our resources. We must adopt whatever means necessary to advantage our merchants and limit the ability of predatory foreign merchants to exploit us."

 I45_a_protectionism_approach_desc:0 "Our measures to protect internal trade have proven to be inadequate.

All that they could recall was waking in the middle of the night, determined to find the source of the whispers that filled their minds. \n\nIn that determination, a single step had turned into ten thousand. And at the end of the journey, long after the familiar forest had given way to this strange and otherworldly place, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found themself before the Whisperer. No, they had a name. One that the wind itself barely dared to murmur, the Blackened Prince.\n\nThe Prince was unlike any other creature the [Root.Culture.GetName] had seen before. They were regal, slender and poised. Beautiful did not quite capture their visage for they did not stir of the mind or the loins, but rather the heart. It instilled in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a sense of awe and the chill of fear. Perhaps it was only natural. The Prince's very presence radiated power. Their gaze pressed upon [Root.Monarch.GetName], smothering them.\n\n“Ah, so one hast finally heard mine call\nSteady enough in spirit, mighty enough in body\nTo venture before mineself.\nCurious.”\n\nA small smile slowly creeped itself upon the Blackened Prince.

Yet in all that time, we’ve worked to avoid straying too far from trodden paths. Stories passed down from grandparent to grandchild have cautioned against taking one step too far.\n\nThey were stories well told. We were a scattered people without hardly any comprehension of what the Feyrealm even was. Our relationships with its Fey denizens were… still being established. Simply put, we were not ready for extra-planar exploration. But, now? We are one people with generations of experiences with our neighboring plane. Its inhabitants are no longer seen as fickle and impetuous, but understood as flexible and eager.\n\nAnd now one of our own has found a new path.\n\nThe adventurous Wood Elf known as Vucras Siubálrn (‘’Vucras the Traveler’’), has discovered a reliable means through the Feyrealm. This path appears to lead to another forest, one in our own plane! This has caused quite a stir in the court and has led to courtiers urging us to officially fund expeditions with Vucras at the lead."

For today carries a story not of wondrous discovery but of mortal squabbles.\n\nThe mysterious Feyrealm-connected forest holds elves just like ours. But they are… different. With their exotic skin colors, strange tongues and bizarre customs, it seems like we hold more apart than together. Indeed, perhaps for that reason, these elves are intensely hostile. Our intrepid explorer has reported that skirmishes with these wayward elves are increasingly common."

Upon the butterflies landing on trainees, the glade was soon filled with the plagued screams of tortured souls. Where the butterflies rested, multiple pustules erupted with fountains of blood. Moments later, their teeth began to rot as their eyes… no, I shall not desecrate their bodies further by describing the horrors.

Indeed, during the time of the Verdant Veil, the fey seemed to have moved the freest there, able to pass from their maddening realm into ours at will. People could also move the other direction, and there are many tales and records of travelers accidentally slipping through into the Fey realm. In the most extreme cases, entire villages would simply disappear without a trace, buildings and people all.\n\nWith the Verdant Veil gone, there were some who had hoped such events would cease. These hopes were dashed, when reports came in that multiple settlements have seemingly vanished in [deepwoods_disappeared_villages_province.GetName]. The shock of these disappearances has come down hard on relatives of the missing, and search parties were sent out to look for any signs, but the vanished hamlets have left no trace - the ground where they once stood is now wild woodland bearing no signs that anyone ever lived there at all."

Almost exactly where they had disappeared, the villages have returned. Once again small cottages can be found nested atop the dense wood and the sounds of rural life once again hum alongside the quiet tune of wildlife. \n\nThe joyous news swept the surrounding countryside, and people flocked to the lost villages - some to gawk, others to search for lost loved ones. Celebrations quickly turned muted, however, when differences began to be noticed . To start, not everyone seems to have returned, and those who have returned have been described by their former friends and relatives as… different than before.

In the dark depths below the surface, the miners claim that there are terrifying fey beasts and whispers that torment the mine, and it was impossible to stay below for extended periods.\n\nRecently, several new caverns have appeared that hold great promise. After a cautious exploration, our people have returned excitedly to announce they are full of rich silver veins waiting for exploitation - if only we bring the tools and light the dark tunnels.

This alone has made the grove unpopular and sparsely populated. However, our administrators have far more serious concerns about the provinces there.\n\nLurking beneath the dark canopy of the Shadow Grove are a group of fey who are known as the Ashentree Pact. Vengeful and territorial, they were once worshippers and adherents of the World Tree that once stood in Oldhaven before the Castanorians burned the tree millennia ago. The destruction of the great tree turned the fey towards bloody vengeance, and as a group the Ashentree have a single-minded obsession with punishing humanity for their transgressions against the wood. To this end, they have sought to use any and all tools, including the mortal inhabitants of the Deepwoods, as weapons in their crusade. \n\nIt has been some time since the Ashentree have troubled us directly, but a small group has recently appeared to the governor of [Root.Province.GetName] with a message for our government.

However, on occasion, parts of the grove can be found picked clean of any bones. If one were to foolishly search for where these bones went they would find Bone Towers, bizarre towering structures made up of nothing but bone. After which, one would spot the tower’s creators, the Bone-Hoarders.\n\nIndescribable in shape or size, Bone-Hoarders are fey whose very presence can shatter the psyche. This is because mortals that come close to Bone-Hoarders are subject to repeated intrusive thoughts of self harm and death. If exposed for too long, the victims often act on these thoughts.\n\nIt is for this reason that the governor of [deepwoods_bonehoarders_province.GetName] is distressed to report an unusually large gathering of Bone-Hoarders.

Today is proof of that.\n\nFor today, on the shores of Silent Lake, throngs of elves from across the Deepwoods crowd and teem. Forgotten are any clan feuds or rivalries. Instead, the air is charged with excitement and energy. \n\nAnd on the lake itself is an ecliptic mix of dinghies, canoes, and yachts. None of these diminutive vessels can compare to any of the ships that brought their ancestors across. But, strangely when taken together, the hodgepodge does strike a vague, miniaturized, resemblance to the Remnant Fleet.\n\nAs a horn sounds. Moments later, the various vessels set off.

Moon elves became Wood Elves and Ciranmyna expanded to meet the needs of these new peoples. When space atop the mountain ran out, the elves turned to gently weaving new buildings into the rock itself. And with each new spurt of growth, Ciranmyna was woven further and further across the mountain. The effort was always both time and resource consuming, but it was always worth the effort.\n\nNow some local elves have decided that it is time once more to expand Ciranmnya. Plans have been drawn, workers and mages contracted, and now there is just the matter of paying for all of this. \n\nWe can rest assured that the city is rich enough that the locals can fund it themselves. But, the extra tax won’t make anyone happy. On the other hand, we could aid them in the effort. The locals rather zealously promised the benefits would be worth the cost."

Not only this, but the land is also rather arid, with the sun’s heat becoming particularly unbearable by midday. Unprepared for this, the expedition had begun to falter. Disaster, however, was averted thanks to the intervention of winged feminine creatures of, given the gratuitous detail, great beauty. While initially believed to be wayward fey, these "harpies" were apparently and curiously ignorant of either the Seelie or Unseelie.\n\nUpon being taken to one of their "roosts" atop a mountain to recover, the expeditionaries were surprised to find not only additional harpies but also non-harpies too. There they spotted dark skinned orcs much unlike the green ones familiar to us, hardy humans tending flocks, and even strange elves from land known as Bulwar! As it would turn out, this collection of races were the "mates" of the harpies.\n\nThe harpies would prove to be "gracious hosts" while the expedition recovered.

They weren’t just any Wood Elves, they were survivors of the expedition sent out west years ago.\n\nAs the tale would have it, these expeditionaries had found refuge in an ancient castle on the outskirts of the dreaded swamp, apparently known as "Daravan’s Folly". There, they were stumbled upon by passing merchants who took pity on them. What ensued was a journey unlike any other.\n\nTheir journey took them south to the land of Ourdia, where ancient fortifications, like the one in which the expeditionaries sheltered, dotted the land. As they traveled further, they stumbled upon a number of different races. The first were goblins, both the ones we are familiar with and those of "an exodus". Later, they encountered communities of humans and "Sun Elves", elves who are apparently distant cousins of our own forebears. And though they did not get to see it, they were told of a city known as Ovdal Tûngr, dug deep into the southern mountains themselves where the "Copper Dwarves" resided.\n\nBut none of that compared to the sight of "where the land ended and water began". To the amazement of every listener, the returning elves told of how the endless "sea" glistened under the sun and where vessels larger than any that sailed Silent Lake across into the horizon."

 deepwoods.60.d:0 "The mysterious forests of the Deepwoods teem with both life and death, a verdant stage upon which the cycle of nature has played out since the dawn of time - if such a thing can be said of a place a so deeply under the influence of the Fey. There is one more than any other who embodies these laws, a great and terrible archfey of the Seelie Court. The wood elves, first tenants of the glades, know him as Arsydbadhál, the Old Wolf. The warlike green orcs learned quickly to respect his domain, and named him Asgud-Domd, Master of the Hunt, while the clever goblins simply called him Prezmorzmept, Death’s Grasp. Such labels serve as but a warning of the Lord of Beast’s mastery over the woods, as he again and again stalks the glades, in search of ever more fearsome game.\n\nThe scales of nature demand balance, however, and the Lord himself must be both predator and prey. According to legend, the Lord of Beasts will leave signs of his presence, an open invitation to the bravest and most resourceful hunters. At first, rumors of his mark appearing were dismissed as coincidence, but the truth can no longer be denied - he has summoned you to [hunt_location.GetName]."

Courtiers and advisors huddle together a stone’s throw, skeptical and yet terrified. A towering oak bears the mark, matching the reports from the garrison: four cuts, deep and wide, cleave down the face of the tree, each equally terrible, but clearly made in one stroke. The wet air seems to wrap itself around you, covering your skin in a beaded blanket of moisture… or perhaps sweat. He is waiting."

As you survey his bulging muscles, scar-covered hide and razor claws, you see the cycle of life, stretching infinitely deep into the past and future, as eternal as it is bereft of malice. There is no evil here, no monsters but those of mortal invention, just a single destiny shared by all: to live, and then to die.

He and his warriors would march north and flush out the elf witch’s troops prodding at his clan’s land once more.\n\nThe orc paused, then gave a cold smile. His warriors. His clan.\n\nNot too long ago, he had simply been Khagor; a raider amongst the Greentide’s hordes, until he had broken an elven host by cutting down its leaders. His deathly smile widened. That had been a bloody and glorious day; the day Clan Sapchopper was declared with him as chieftain.\n\nHowever, since then, time had begun to blur. He often felt as though years had passed, even if he or his orcs did not show it. No doubt something to do with this cursed forest and that mist that had taken him.\n\nHe growled.\n\nOnce he and his orcs had hoped to escape these woods, to leave this Dookan-forsaken land and never return. But that hope had long since soured.\n\nThere was no escape. There was no going back.\n\nA weak groan cut through the orc’s musing. He looked down to find the source of the low sound. It was the elf he had cut down. The chieftain felt his smile return as he watched the elf try to crawl away, a trail of blood oozing behind them. After enjoying the sight a moment longer, he brought down his ax once more.\n\nIf Clan Sapchopper could not leave this forest, then it would break it and its inhabitants."

Khagor never heard its clatter. Gone was the ambient noise of his victorious clan.\n\nIt was just like the first time the mists had taken him. He was alone, blinded and deafened by this suffocating white blanket. Then, he felt something. Something… more.\n\n“Mighty Khagor,” an essence whispered. “Thou hast done well vanquishing thine foes. Truly thine strength is befit of thou’s creator’s vision.”\n\nThe words echoed in Khagor’s head, consuming his thoughts. A daze washed over him.\n\n“Consider, mighty warrior, that a chain binds you still. That thine kin and self remain shackled, denied thine true potential. Yet, thou mayst still be freed.”\n\nKhagor opened his mouth, but no words came. The world began to spin.\n\n“Behold thy hand.”\n\nDespite his fading vision, he felt compelled to look. There in his hand was his goblet once more.\n\n“A gift. A taste of what thou couldst possess - unshackled might. Thy and thine kin needst only drink.”\n\nThe chieftain blacked out. When he came to, he found himself standing once more amongst his cheering clan. They acted oblivious to his disappearance. For a moment, the orc considered blaming his drunkenness.

Together, they attempted to escape the Deepwoods. It was an attempt that ultimately failed. And in the time that followed, those who had not joined the Bloodytusks were swept away by the Greentide’s invasion.\n\nAll of this was history that was willingly left forgotten, until now. With our recent conquest of the old Bloodytusk lands in the Hunter’s Grove, there are veterans of our clan who have begun to recall their roots. While they proudly and loyally bear the Sapchopper name, these grizzled warriors have gone so far as to begin petitioning our Chieftain for the right to rule their old home.\n\nSuch arrangements of lesser clans ruling under greater ones are not unheard of. Agreeing would lend us a valuable stream of warriors and enable better use of the land, however it would come at the cost of some control.\n\nWhat say you, Chieftain?"

His glorious city. \n\n“But there couldst be more.”\n\nHis head throbbed, yet he could not dismiss the thought. The city was not enough.

Of course, the first to do so will be our chieftain, flanked by our clan’s finest warriors. With the weapons sharpened, the traps set, and the provisions prepared, there only remains one task - deciding our prey.\n\nTo the south roam the iron-scaled carapellars, easily able to crush an orc with its maws.

Take your eyes off of them, and you’d forget they were ever even there. It was just like the Whisperer, the false orc whose foul words had spelled doom for his clan.\n\nA bitterness welled up within Ruuk from knowing that creature was on the prowl once more. Its machinations had brought the Greentide to a halt; ruined him and more. Now, it sought something from the strongest of the orc clans.\n\n“Shit, lost him.”\n\nRuuk blinked at his companion’s words.

The handful of skulkers with him regarded their leader wearily, sensing his half-thought.\n\n“You’re not planning on getting us lost in the Feyrealm again, are ya?”\n\nHe shook his head, “Once was enough.”\n\nThere was a quiet collective sigh of relief.\n\n“Then what now?”\n\nRuuk frowned, racking his mind. There were only two ways to chart an uncharted gladeway. The first was trial and error. That wasn’t going to happen. The second was to acquire a wayfare of some kind, a grounding object that could help him navigate the Feyrealm.

When arriving at his destination, Ruuk could feel his heart pounding. It was his father’s personal quarters. A lifetime ago this was where he had made his shameful escape. Now, this was where his redemption would finally begin.\n\nThe room itself was in poor order. Strewn across it were strange trinkets, feymarked materials, and pages of incomprehensible scribbles. All of them depicted a figure, slender, pale as ash. Despite the crudeness of the drawing, Ruuk could feel the figure’s stare. Written below were three words, “The Blackened Prince”.\n\nHe shuddered before beginning a frantic search. After too long, he found it, a small dark box made of elm. It had been long coveted by his father. Involuntarily, he spat to the side in anger. The great chieftain Troknar Silentblade, desperate for a small trinket."

Not as it did in the Prime Material for the air was too heavy with fey energy. It winded and twisted. And somewhere in those moments, Khagor Sapchopper summoned the energy to look up at the twilight sky. The dancing lights were as far from the caverns of the Serpentspine he was born in as he could imagine. Never had he thought of such a place. But never had he had thought he would become more than a raider. Never had he thought he would lead a clan, his clan, to victory after victory.

He was meant to learn to rule by sharing in and questioning his father’s decisions and judgments. \n\nThose days were over. The longer clan Silentblade had been in the Deepwoods, the more [Root.Monarch.GetName] had sought solitude, often spending hours alone in the woods before returning to give orders to his clan. Initially, Ruuk thought he had been grieving the death of his mother. But as the orders grew more erratic and the [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s own behaviour grew stranger, Ruuk began to realize there was something more to it than that. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had no intention of teaching him command, because he did not intend for him to ever take command.\n\nBecause [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not intend to die.\n\nSomething had been set in motion, and Ruuk knew he was far too late to stop it, if he had ever been able to. Something had brought the Greentide into this accursed forest, and whatever it was, it was about to consume clan Silentblade. He had to fight it, but he couldn’t, not here, not alone. He would gather allies among the other clans, he had told himself. To challenge his father to Ozarm’Chadash before knowing what it was he faced was foolish, he had told himself.

No, this will tie you to the fey, nothing more. It is the pact that brings immortality. This is just the fuel.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] dipped a cup into the cauldron, and offered it to him, but the Chieftain hesitated. “And what do we give in return?” [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s smile dissipated. “You know the answer to that question. It is necessary. Dookan is lost, and Dookanson is dead. This is the only future for our kind. The only future without weakness, without dishonor. It is not servitude, it is purpose.

There was nothing to win or glory to be had.\n\nInstead, there was raging of the foliage, animated with a frenzy more akin to a berserker. Distant yet ever present was the roaring rage of unseen creatures, as if crying out for vengeance. And, most pressing, was the thrum of the air itself. It was thick, thicker than Ugol had ever thought possible, even for the Forest. And how it clung to him! As though it was trying to claim him as its own.\n\nUgol grunted with a restless shuffle.\n\nFear. Uncertainty. Doubt. These foes had risen once more, and this time they held a strength that seemed unsurmountable. To his shame, Ugol shifted his eyes to catch sight of the other warriors. They, like him, swayed with unease. He caught another orc’s gaze just long enough to know they felt it. Whatever it was.\n\nA distant thought screamed to leave this place. It was shameful. Yet, Ugol almost turned. Almost. It was only the sight of [Root.Country.Monarch.GetName] that kept him rooted.

This is where we show our might!”\n\nThe ragtag orcs before him bellowed as one. Their rage, their anger, their strength washed over him. This was not some mix of lost and clanless orcs. This was the vanguard against villainy what stood before them.\n\nDropping his bow, Ruuk Elmscourge, no, Ruuk Silentblade hefted his ax.\n\n“Together! For Clan Silentblade!”\n\nHe turned to face the chaotic crowd of orcs he once called his clan. They were disorganized. Weak. Yet, in the distance, he could spot the creature he had thought dead rising once more. He snorted, ignoring the pit in his stomach.

The Spriggan could not help but tremble, for though it kept its head down the Prince’s cold fury could be felt if not seen.\n\n“We shall gather that which has been lost after,” the Prince finally spoke, their words cool as frost. “Begin.”\n\nWithout daring a look back, the Spriggan floated forward toward the center of the ritual circle. High above the unsuspecting victorious survivors, it chanted the words that had taken a thousand lives to learn. Soon a thousand more voices cried in agony, joining the Spriggan’s chant.\n\nYes, pain was how it would begin. The heat of flame would lick the orcs’ very souls. Then would come sorrow. A suffocating ash that threatened to swallow them whole. But, then, there would be anger. Righteous indignation toward the fate that has been cast upon them. Finally, vengeance. For every wrong must be met with wrong.\n\nYet, for now, there was quiet.\n\nThe Spriggan looked down and saw a teeming sea of emerald. Were not so dreadful, perhaps, it would have felt pride. But what pride could there be in the silence?\n\n“You’ve served me well, Grey Weaver.”\n\nIn that moment, the Grey Weaver felt a stirring. A completeness that had escaped it for all its short life till now. The Weaver looked up toward its creator. Yet the Prince did not meet its gaze, instead simply staring out into the shimmering neon horizon of the Feyrealm."

Here, where life sprung freely, its passage was no more pressing than the light breeze that passed through the Blackened Prince’s burnt visage.\n\nOn the other side, however, time was a roaring gale. The Prince could feel their minions overtaking the clans and creatures not yet swayed. There was still resistance, yes, but the first step had finally been taken.\n\n“T’is not a wise course, dear Prince,” a whimsy voice echoed.\n\n“Indeed,” agreed a kind wizened voice. “This shall bear nothing but sour fruit!”“Shackles not growth,” something chittered darkly. “Stagnation not change.”\n\nA delicate verdant hand then grazed the Prince’s cheek, its owner softly whispering into their ear: “Such a rotten expression. Whatever happened to my dear Guardian of the Bloom?”\n\nThe air cracked with the snap of wood as the Blackened Prince snatched away the hand. Deep within, the archfey felt a fury long smoldering threaten to erupt into violent blaze. For a timeless moment, the flame of hatred nearly consumed him. But then the moment passed, for even in the Feyrealm time flowed on.\n\n“The Guardian is dead, fair Lady,” the Prince replied bitterly, turning to meet his gathered audience, “Nothing but ash like all the rest who were lost.”\n\nThe Prince of Fools. Lord Blossom. The Herald of Change. Even the Emerald Lady. The Prince had known his actions would draw ire and attention, but that both Seelie and Unseelie were openly questioning him was more than he had anticipated. Yet, that did not mean he was unprepared.\n\n“But, I’ve not forgotten the Guardian’s charge,” the archfey continued before reaching within his charred body. Wood once more creaked and splintered as the Prince pulled out the one hope that had still dwelled within him. Gently uncurling his finger, the archfey produced a single seed not unlike an acorn, in both size and shape.\n\nUpon its sight, the other archfey said nothing. Their misgivings, their doubts, their questions still lingered. But, they did not.\n\nAlone once more, the Blackened Prince let his gaze rest upon the innocuous seed."

They would only be enough to make a statement, to rally the orcs at the ritual.\n\nOrcs follow the strongest, he reminded himself. He did not need to win outright. All he needed to do was to show strength, and the rest would fall into place."

 #Forest Goblin flavour events
 forest_goblin.1.t:0 "Traps, Unlimited Traps..."
 forest_goblin.1.d:0 "The Greentide has been, to put it bluntly, disastrous for us Forest Goblins. Already struggling to fight back against the Wood Elves, the warhost of Orcs pouring into the woods shattered any defence that could be put up. Hopelessly outclassed on the battlefield, it was only the ingenuity of our minds that kept us holding onto the fringes of our groves.\n\nEvery goblin knows now that for all their might, even the strongest orc will fall the same as anyone else to a hidden pitfall trap. Discipline is only so useful for an Elven battalion when faced with a rolling spiked log. We have gotten very good at fortifying our lands with traps - and some of our goblins in [too_many_traps_province.GetName] seem to have gotten too good.\n\nWe've received reports from the areas that the traps are so widespread and prevalent that it is becoming impossible to get around without falling victim to something ourselves. Not a day goes by where one of our own goblins doesn't go missing in the forest, and calls are being made to stop building new ones - at least until we figure out where the ones we already have are. "
 forest_goblin.1.a:0 "Maybe no more traps?"
 forest_goblin.1.b:0 "We can never have too many traps!"
 forest_goblin.2.t:0 "Lost Goblins Found"
 forest_goblin.2.d:0 "In the chaos of the greentide, goblin society faced complete upheaval. Families were separated, loved ones lost, and entire clans were destroyed by the invading orcs. With the chaos dying down now, and our tribe re-establishing its place, some of these survivors have slowly found their way back to us.\n\nRecently, our scouts have reportedly found a large group of goblins, long thought to be lost forever. Long lost cousins and friends have been reunited and it seems the group has even brought back some treasure from their time in the wilderness. Although, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it is worth noting that some of these arrivals seem... off. No doubt with their long absence, the fey have had something to do with their return."
 forest_goblin.2.a:0 "We should welcome them back, we need anyone we can get."
 forest_goblin.2.b:0 "We might as well be inviting the fey to live next door - send them away!"
 forest_goblin.2.c:0 "They've probably learned a thing or two from the fey..."
 forest_goblin.3.t:0 "Angry Treant"
 forest_goblin.3.d:0 "The kartels operating in our country have one love above all else - money. Normally, this is a great arrangement for us, with us getting a slice of the profits. Unfortunately, some of our goblins' greeds seem to have run too far, and a timber kartel in our country has expanded their operations in a... reckless manner.\n\nEveryone in the Deepwoods knows that the forest is dangerous. The first lesson we all learn as a child - don't stray too far from the path, or the woods will eat you whole. So when trees start being cut, further and further into the Feywild, attention is drawn. In our case, it seems to have drawn the attention of a treant, who unsurprisingly isn't too happy with our logging operations in the area. Unless we send aid to [angry_treant_province.GetName], our production in the area will struggle until the treant moves on."
 forest_goblin.3.a:0 "Send them the help they need."
 forest_goblin.3.b:0 "They dug their grave, now they can lie in it"
 forest_goblin.4.t:0 "Artificery in the Deepwoods"
 forest_goblin.4.d:0 "With the rise of artificery in our country, new devices are sprouting up every day from our enterprising inventors. Our position in the Deepwoods uniquely gives us easy access to magical components, either from the fey or more directly growing in the woods.\n\nOur inventions are sure to make a hefty profit if we spread them to our neighbours, eager as ever to get their hands on our goods. However, a group of advisors backed by some artificers have come to us asking to halt the burgeoning trade, allowing us to keep all of our goods for ourselves."
 forest_goblin.4.a:0 "How much did you say we're selling these for?"
 forest_goblin.4.b:0 "We should keep these for ourselves..."
 forest_goblin.5.t:0 "Catastrophe in the Canopy"
 forest_goblin.5.d:0 "For as long as we have known, Forest goblins have built homes high in the trees, away from the dangers of the forest floor as well as any prying eyes. Entire towns and villages have been built between the branches of the Deepwoods, connected by small rope bridges and questionable architectural choices.\n\nOver the years, [fallen_building_goblin.GetName] has seen a massive population boom, with the small village in the trees having grown into a burgeoning city. Unfortunately, disaster has recently struck as the weight of so many goblins has brought a few buildings crashing to the ground, killing hundreds of goblins and injuring many more.\n\nMost call for us to immediately send aid to [fallen_building_goblin.GetName] to rebuild, but some in our court propose a step further. A chief advisor has proposed a new organisation, the Organisation of Safety at High Altitudes, to implement new building regulations and ensure this doesn't happen again. Not many goblins would be happy with being told how to build their houses, but it may just be a necessary measure."
 forest_goblin.5.a:0 "We don't have any money to spare, they'll have to make do."
 forest_goblin.5.b:0 "Send some money to repair and be done with it."
 forest_goblin.5.c:0 "We should make sure this never happens again!"
 forest_goblin_osha:0 "These regulations, while unpopular, should greatly reduce the chances of this happening again."
 forest_goblin.6.t:0 "The Yellow Lights Festival"
 forest_goblin.6.d:0 "After decades of waiting, the stars have aligned for another Yellow Light Festival. Dating back to the time of the Oldwoods, before even the old Forest Goblin kingdom rose and fell, its origins have long since been lost to time. Regardless, the sky is clear- there's not going to be a night like tonight for a long time.\n\nWhile every tribe, and even each generation of goblins, has come to celebrate slightly differently, the general practice of the night remains the same. The goblins of the clan gather in their villages, hanging up firefly lanterns and sharing the stories of their parents down to the next generation. Most goblins only ever attend one festival in their lifetimes, and they end up an occasion like no other.\n\nTonight, the forest will glow under a sea of glowing lights above, and yellow eyes below."
 forest_goblin.6.a:0 "Sounds fun, but we don't have the money to spare..."
 forest_goblin.6.b:0 "We can spend a little to keep them happy."

 #Salla Cenag Loc
 salla_cenag.1.t:0 "Alara of the Bone Clan"
 salla_cenag.1.d:0 "My heart was pounding. My mouth was dry. Every sentence I babbled was followed by a wild gesture. One moment, I was waving my hands, another I was pointing toward one of the warriors gathered. I could not help but pace back and forth. My feet tromping as I claimed every bit of space in the clearing made by throngs of clanselves surrounding me.\n\nI felt like a mad fool, deluded into thinking my people believed a word I said. Yet, when I locked eyes with each elf before me, I saw only faith. Even after years of never-ending war. Years of blood, tears, and too many lost loved ones. They still believed in me.\n\n“My bloodkin! Never forget each breath is not given! It is taken! Remember the Bone Struggle!”\n\nI pound my chest. My throat aches, but still I feel the words erupt, “Yfel Cenág!”\n\nA thousand chest pounds drum out as I hear my words echoed in a chorus back to me, “Yfel Cenág!"\n\nI pound my chest again, “Yfel Cenág!”\n\nMy kin do the same, roaring with the might of thunder. But, it wasn’t enough. My voice cracks as I scream one last time, “Yfel Cenág!”\n\nWhat came after left the bones that littered our land rattling. It was not simple thunder, it was the storm. It was a clan’s anguish and anger, its hopes and dreams, and most of all, its desire to live.\n\nWhen the bellows and shouts finally died, as all things do, I gestured for the warriors to head out. I felt my stomach lurch as I ushered my commands. That ever present voice whispered why anyone was listening to someone like me, but practice had made it easier to focus. And, after an hour, the clearing had emptied leaving me seemingly alone to my thoughts.\n\nThe voice questioned quietly again. Could I really just let my people, my kin, ride out to danger without me? I was ceanna, their clan head. It was a position I was never supposed to hold, the least I could do was be there with them.\n\nI moved to mount up, letting action not thought answer the voice that filled my head. But, before I could hoist myself up, a familiar someone called out."
 salla_cenag.1.a:0 "“What are you doing, Al?”"
 salla_cenag.1.a.tt:0 "My heart began to race...\n"
 salla_cenag.2.t:0 "Promises"
 salla_cenag.2.d:0 "I turned slowly, letting my own dark brown eyes meet her bright blue ones. They were filled with the stubborn resolution I loved. Her verdant green hair, normally free-flowing, was bound in a bun. Her thin lips were pressed downward and her thin brows bent. By the Fey, she was beautiful. Even as my already queasy stomach sank, keeping her in my sight was all I could consider.\n\n“Don’t just gawk at me, Alara,” she demanded. “Answer me.”\n\nI pursed my lips before letting my admission fall out, “I was about to ride out.”\n\n“You said you wouldn’t.”\n\n“I did…”\n\n“Then, why did you lie to me?” Despite her best attempts, Lanhara’s voice was rising, “You promised.”\n\n“I couldn’t leave them behind,” I gestured to the dark woods ahead. “What good am I to our clan if I’m not there?”\n\n“What good?” She repeated before sighing. “Are you even thinking about what you’re saying next?”\n\n“No…” I admit.\n\nLanhara stared at me before pinching her nose, “Think, Al. You need to think. Not just about me… but about our clan. What happens if… you die out there?”\n\n“I won’t.”\n\nShe shakes her head, her eyes growing glossy. “Like Balarion? Like Eledas?” \n\nI felt my heart drop as she whispered the names of my lost brothers. For the first time, I think about what would happen if I don’t come back. I think of my clanselves. I think of Hara. Who would protect them? Who would protect her? The unimaginable becomes imaginable and grips me. What if…\n\nMy heart spurs me once more to act. I steel myself and…"
 salla_cenag.2.a:0 "…bring my lips to hers. “I won’t die,” I promise her, and myself, as we part with tears."

 salla_cenag.3.t:0 "Narawen of the Thorn Clan"
 salla_cenag.3.d:0 "As a sapling, I had spent countless days in Drennethille visiting distant cousins and kin. I still remember laughing and running, taking in the sweet air, charged with an energy I could never describe. Yet, despite those happy days and those blood ties, I hadn’t been here well over a decade. All because of my own stupidity.\n\n“Alara? Are you listening?”\n\nI looked at my dear cousin, my ‘little sister’ - Narawen Drennen. Despite the blood that had been shed between our clans. Despite my screams and shouts at her at Elynaile. She still stood by me. By Salla Cenág.\n\n“So, you got access to the Crucible?” I asked uncertainly, trying to recall Narwen’s explanation.\n\nNarawen nodded, “Sort of. I got access to a Challenge. But, there’s not that much of a difference.”\n\nI tap my chin, “So just beat down some random zites or whatever else they throw at us, then poof!” I made a gesture with my hands. “Boons?”\n\n“Well, it might be a bit harder than that but ye-”\n\nI gave a laugh before enveloping Narawen. I didn’t need to hear more to know it would work. Narawen knew how to handle the fey. And, with their boons, we’d win for sure. \n\n“It’s brilliant, Wen!”\n\n“Ala…pleas…” Narawen wheezed. “Crushin…me”\n\nI released my cousin. She stumbled back with an exasperated grin.\n\n“I missed those hugs…” she heaved, “...at least I think I did. Now with that done, how about some lunch?”\n\nWith a toothy smile, I gave a full nod. Together, we headed down the steps toward the dining hall. As we did, I took a full breath of air I missed for so long. This was how it was supposed to be. Family helping family."
 salla_cenag.3.a:0 "One day, I would return the favor. And more."
 salla_cenag.3.insight:0 "§GEvent Insight:§!\nMy sweet cousin, §YNarawen Drennen§!, has forgiven my foolishness for calling her and Salla Drennen, our dearest ally, enemy a thousand times. Still I feel shame for my poor judgement. Even more so after receiving her messenger requesting I visit her in §YDrennthille§! with promises of §YFey Boons§Y." 
 salla_cenag.4.t:0 "Rage Against the Sorrow"
 salla_cenag.4.d:0 "Lanhara and I froze as we entered the desolate, shadow-draped audience chamber. There Irvah Ayeth, the elf who had taught me war and glaive, was seated not on the highseat but beneath it clutching some dirty cloak. He paid neither me nor Hara, his own granddaughter, heed despite our gentle calls. Hara motioned me still before approaching the sullen elf, trying to softly stir the Cean of Salla Ayeth. When that failed, she became forceful. The same piercing questions she had set upon me, she now let loose against Irvah. What of clan Ayeth? What of her and her father?\n\nI didn’t catch what he whispered, but there was no missing Hara light up in anger. It was only the second time I had ever seen her this way. Gone was any restraint. She cursed. She screamed. She stomped. Yet despite her fury and demands to know where the “Stalwart of Ayeth” was, she was given no answer.\n\nEventually, her anger faded. She simply turned and left. One scalding look was all I needed to wordlessly follow. And as we moved to exit the audience chamber, we found ourselves stopped by a wild-looking figure. Immediately, my instincts motioned me to step in front of Lanhara. As I did, I heard my love’s voice whisper, “Father?” \n\nMy jaw dropped. This elf was Elaria?\n\n“He's dead, daughter. Just like my mother and your grandmother,” Elaria started flatly, ignoring the question. “His body just hasn’t caught up.”\n\nNeither of us replied, uncertain of what to say, but Elaria paid our silence no heed. Instead, his fists clenched as a dangerous edge lined his voice, “He refuses to act. Even when our people can’t afford it. Not when those vermin infest our lands.”\n\nHis eyes finally meet mine. Even eye to eye, I couldn’t recognize the elf I once called áthyr'ionn, ‘oath-father’.\n\n“But you are different, nía'ionn. Salla Cenág is different.” His fists loosened and he offered his hand to me. “My oath-daughter, we will do what he cannot. We will save our people.”\n\nI felt myself tighten under his hollow gaze. This was grief. Rage. Anguish. It was something that couldn't be faced alone, but he wasn't alone."
 salla_cenag.4.a:0 "I clasped his hand, doing my best to ignore its cold grip."
 salla_cenag.4.a.tt:0 "§YElaria Ayeth§! will become §Gavailable§! to lead our armies. He brings §Yrangers§! to bolster our forces.\n\n§TPlay Salla Ayeth to experience Elaria's story from his point of view!§!"
 salla_cenag.4.insight:0 "§GEvent Insight:§!\nEven before Lanhara and I were oathbound, her clan, Salla Ayeth, was amongst my clan's closest allies amongst all the Great Salla. If we are to push back against our foes, we will need their §Yrangers§!. However, none of Hara's missives have returned since her grandmother's death at the hands of the invaders. We all grieve for her loss, but Hara fears that something worse as befallen §Yher father§! and §Yher grandfather§!... It seems we will need to ride to Ayethstir ourselves."
 salla_cenag.5.t:0 "Broken Promises"
 salla_cenag.5.d:0 "All I could taste was the metallic twang of blood. My ears rang. They were filled with cries, screams and dea-. Pain. There was so much pain. \n\nBut that didn’t matter. None of that mattered. I promised her.\n\nWith my one good arm, I slowly dragged myself across the ground. That was it. Don’t think. Just keep moving. You promised her. \n\nMy body rattled as I choked on a blood choked sob. My vision spun. The pain began to fade, but I managed to drag myself once more. That’s it. Just. Keep. Moving. Remember. The promise.\n\nI called out to my body. To my one loyal limb. To just one finger. But, nothing replied. I tried to take a breath but found no air. All I could feel was a distant wetness. Tears."

It was the latest of its kind to come in the last weeks.\n\n“Another successful raid?” Lanhara asked, peering over my shoulder.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Good,” she said as she began massaging my shoulders. I closed my eyes to enjoy the moment, but instead my thoughts drifted to battle and strategy. My smile flipped.\n\n“Sorry,” Hara apologized, assuming it was the knot she had just hit.\n\nI brought my hand to hers. “No, it wasn’t you. It’s those orcs and their bastard chieftain.” She continued the massage knowing I wasn’t done. “We’ve killed hundreds of those brutes, but they just won’t break.”\n\nMy words hung in the air.\n\n“A single thrust of the glaive over a thousand arrows?,” Lanhara finally offered.\n\nI looked up behind, toward her. “Yes, a single glaive thrust! We are going to have to face them head on!”\n\n“And who exactly is ‘we’?”\n\nI snort, “You know what I mean.”\n\nShe raised her eyebrows, “Do I?”"
 salla_cenag.7ruler.a:0 "I give a sigh and peck on her cheek, “I’m not going to fight.”"
 salla_cenag.7general.d:0 "The air is odorous with the smell of sweat, blood, and death. I breathe deeply through my nose, having long gotten used to the stench, my eyes scanning the victorious battlefield. As my stag slowly trots, I silently count the bodies of fallen orcs. As my count reaches hundred, my grim smile sours. \n\nHow many of these feyscorned invaders had I and my clan cut down? A thousand? Two thousand? More? Countless corpses and still I couldn’t push them back. Why?\n\nI shook my head knowing the answer. It was their bastard chieftain - Khagor “Sapchopper”. As long as he stood, there would never-\n\nI froze.\n\n“A single thrust of the glaive over a thousand arrows,” I whispered.\n\nSlowly, I nodded to myself. Yes, that was the answer.

And, in particular, the cricking and chirping of insects filled the air.\n\nCuting through all of this was Khagor Sapchopper’s roars of rage. The scout had not gotten halfway before Khagor had pieced together that another warparty was dead at the hands of Durzk’ungul, the accursed daughter of the forest known as Alara Cenág. \n\nThis wretch, this bug, this gnat had buzzed his ears insistently since his greatest victory over the elves. She nipped and nicked at him without end, refusing to grant him proper battle.\n\nBut, he would not be denied. In time she and the other little elflings would be forced to face his might.

 salla_cenag.9.d:0 "I couldn’t help but dart my eyes about, trying to take in as much of my surroundings as I could. It must have been at least ten years since I had been on this trail. Long before the orcs had come. Yet in such a short time, so much had changed. The path had been widened. A number of crude markers had been carved into a number of trees. Much of the nearby brush and undergrowth had burned away. The orcs of Sapchopper had left the same scars on the land as our people. The realization leaves me with a frown.\n\n“I’d thought it would feel better,” Narawen suddenly spoke, breaking the long silence between us. “Seeing this all again. Knowing it was over. That we had won.”\n\nI turned to look at her. Gone was the gentle kindness I knew my cousin for. In its place was a hardness, the same edge I saw in Elaria - rage. My own face grew hotter at the sight of her anguish.\n\n“But, I don’t feel better,” she continued softly. “Even though the bastard’s dead. His host of murderers scattered. I just feel…” \n\nNarawen paused.\n\n“The druids teach that hate has no lasting place in life. The Seelie forgive and forget. The Unseelie fight to overcome. But, what of the Ashenfey? Don’t they hate?”\n\nI pursed my lips. Every elf knew of the Ashenfey. Cruel and vicious, their dark prince had spent thousands of years plotting vengeance against some forgotten foe. They were not ones to follow.\n\n“I think I hate them, Alara,” she said, looking past me. For taking my parents. For ruining our lives. But, I don’t want to hate. I don’t want to be like the Ashenfey.”\n\nNarawen looks at me with a lost gaze, “Can we really live with them? After everything that has happened?”\n\nI glance at woods I once knew then back to her.

Even within our clan, renowned for pushing the frontier, only the hardiest of our people were able to settle its edges. And only a select few were willing to press further, driven by the same bold curiosity as our forebears.\n\nThat… may have been a mistake. A folly if you will.\n\nFor today, cutting through the wretched ambience of bog life, were elven screams, both hoarse and hysterical. They were chased after by cackles and hoots, distorted by forces not from our plane. The usual browns and grays of the swamp were alight with sickly green hue. Geysers of verdant fire soon erupted after. And from those pyres emerged hairless, upright snouted creatures. Their eyes burned with chaotic craving as they set upon their victims. "

Between the two parties was a Forest Goblin acting, of all things, a translator. \n\nThe meeting was… an arduous one, but after a number of misunderstandings and some very angry pointing at a map, the Ourdi message finally came across. Apparently the land we conquered from the goblins was theirs only a few years ago. And… they want it back. \n\nThis, of course, came as a surprise. Some terse back and forths and a few not so subtle threats of war followed, but our people managed to conclude the meeting without incident.

Three days of my life for that. Three days spent trapped listening to endless meetings and obtuse discussions. Of course. Leave it to “diplomats” to waste all that time to get the point across.\n\nThe goblin shrugged as I pinched my nose.\n\nAt first, I had been excited at meeting these Ourdi. It was a chance to range beyond the woods for reasons beyond war. I’d meet humans like the fiery-haired woman in Elynaile again. Perhaps even enter the great castle upon the great lake the scouts had been gossiping about. \n\nThat did not happen. \n\nThis whole affair was a war, just different from the ones I typically fought. Words and barbs were traded instead of blade and arrow. None of these humans held that spark she did. And, worst of all, I did not get to enter the castle, muchless even see it.\n\n“How about I give them a fist up their ass?” I muttered.\n\nThe goblin looked at me, wondering if that’s what I wanted to tell the Ourdi [U16.Monarch.GetTitle]. I nearly nodded, but Lanhara stepped in.\n\n“What she means is ‘The Ceanna now understands the cause of this discord. However, these lands are still in chaos. Perhaps it would be easier to resolve this once our shared enemies have been defeated?’”\n\nThe goblin rolled his eyes and relayed the message. Or at least something like it. \n\nThe [U16.Monarch.GetTitle], [U16.Monarch.GetName], grunted then sharply exhaled some gibberish to the goblin before standing up to leave.\n\n“Didn’t catch all of it but it was pretty much a give us back our land… or else.” \n\nI sighed to myself.

Occasionally I would stop to give a nod there, a laugh here, more than a few long embraces. \n\nI raised my cup to take another swig of wine as a shirtless elf carrying a roasted turbin overhead ran past me. A dozen angry cooks raced by me seconds later. I laughed then sputtered as I choked on wine. \n\n“There yous are,” a soft voice called from behind.\n\nI spun around and nearly tipped over as I spotted Narawen wearing a devious grin. Catching me mid-fall, she grabbed my hand and started dragging me. “What are you doing, Wen?”\n\n“Important stuff,” she hiccuped. \n\n“Important stuff?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\nI don’t know how she managed to pull me forward. My dear cousin was a head shorter and half as strong, but I found myself stumbling along after her, the world was a blur as we went. Before I knew it I was pulled up onto a table. I looked up to see Elaria… smiling? At least something close to it.\n\nWith no small struggle, Narawen clambered up beside me and beamed at me. I stared at her dumbfounded only to jolt at the boom of Elaria’s baritone voice, “Listen up! We’ve a toast to give!”\n\nHe gestured to Narawen and crossed his arms.\n\nAs best she could, Narawen attempted to fill Elaria’s void, “My dear People. My dear kith and kin. Ayeth, Cenág and Drennen. Today we celebrate victory!”\n\nCheers and hoots.\n\n“And we celebrate the elf who brought it to us, my cousin, my ‘big sister’ - Alara.”\n\nAnother round of cheers and hoots filled the night air. All the while, my cheeks began to heat.\n\nElaria then stepped forward. He looked at me, and just for a moment, saw the elf I once knew. Then he turned to the crowd and raised his goblet, “To elf who brought Salla Ayeth justice! To my oath-daughter, Alara!”\n\nMore hollering roared out. Soon the gathered elves began chanting a name.

It simply takes time and the will to keep moving.\n\nIt was that will that led us here. Despite countless battles and heartbreaking losses, our clanelves kept moving forward. That destination was where the land tapered into the sea.\n\nAt first there was a deferring silence as our vanguard stood the sandy shores. The smell of salt and life filled their noses. The crashing waves and distant flocks left them speechless.\n\nThen came a realization. We did not even have a word for this place, this “sea”, in our own tongue. It was the thing that our forebears had sailed upon. It was the thing that brought them here to these lands before they were lost to the woods. Yet, we could not call it out. And so the silence broke to sobs as tears freely flowed. How much had we lost?\n\nAs our people grappled with the moment, a village of disheveled humans watched on.

Upon this ‘sea’ the forebears of my clan, of all the clans, sailed to and landed on a ‘beach’ like this. Our people were tied to this place and I couldn’t even use my own tongue to describe these places.\n\nA few tears escaped me as I choked a sob.\n\nI turned back toward the human village, wiping my face off. It was because of these humans that I could find a word for this place. For all of these things I couldn’t even describe. I also knew this was their home.

My mind throbbed. No, it ached. This whole Sun Cult business was far more complicated than I had thought. There were so many rules and details. How could anyone figure this out?\n\n“But what if it’s cloudy?” I asked, “Does that mean he’s busy?”\n\nLanhara nudged me in disapproval. Probably too direct a question, but I ignored her and watched as the two elves each consulted their own dusty texts. From what I gathered, it was something like our own compilation of fey rituals.\n\nAfter some furious page turning, one answered, “If the sky over the temple remains dark for 64 hours, our priests need to sacrifice six pomegranat-” \n\nThe other interrupted, “It’s 72 hours, Kelmonias.”\n\nKelmonias shook his head and pointed to his own text. “Are you doubting my readings again, Amarien?”\n\n“Yes, in fact,” she replied tartly. “Also, you didn’t mention the olives.

If you traveled more, you’d’ve learned Taelarios’ recently stressed the importance of olives.”\n\nPowerlessly, I watched as the elves began to wrestle. They then screamed what were either random verses or crude curses. Something then came up about Jahar, Cinder Wars, and Chosenhood. I felt Lanhara pinch me and I was made aware of her seething gaze. Fine, I thought. I’ll do something.\n\n“Uh… by Surael!” I called out trying to grab their attention, “What are those?” The two elves both look toward me, murder in their eyes then toward the random jar I was pointing at.\n\nThey both looked and then straightened up. \n\n“Lentils,” they answered, their scuffle entirely forgotten."

I smirked as I saw even Narawen shake her head. An elf’s word was their life in the Great Salla. Yet, beyond the woods, that was far from it.\n\n“There are many names for it, but the most common one we heard it called was ‘Feudalism’. Adopting it can apparently be up to fifty percent more effective.”\n\n“Tulmun shit!” a wizened druid cried out as more disgruntled murmurs filled the air.\n\nNarawen nudged me as the pathfinder attempted to wrangle the crowd, “Is that really true?”\n\nWith a toothy smile, I answered, “It is. After adopting it, we found it easier to build new buildings, organize new units, and trade.”\n\nMy cousin nodded slowly, not quite convinced.

Despite being the capital of Salla Cenág, it had barely been more than a backwater. The “town” itself was little more than a handful of hovels larger than the scouting camp it had started as.\n\nYet, now it stood as a true hub of the Deepwoods. One could find metal tubes that thundered and shot fire. Merchants hawked Chronicler manuscripts describing the recently rediscovered lost elven homeland of Aelantir. And if one even listened carefully, they could hear the chants of strange missionaries spreading the word of the Jadd.\n\nStill, it still came as a shock to [Root.Monarch.GetName] when the clans of the Verdant Pact decided to meet within Hofónn rather than return where the Pact was signed in Elynaille.

That would have been too kind.\n\n“It wasn’t that bad, Al,” Lanhara cooed as she sat beside me and began stroking my hair.\n\nI made a disgruntled noise into the pillow in reply.\n\n“And you did well,” she continued. “Much better than Elynaile.

Every ceann, ceanna, and their second cousin-twice removed wouldn’t stop talking to me!”\n\n“Because, they’ve seen what you’ve done, watched how our clan has risen. They want the same for themselves.”\n\n“We did that.” I protested, “Together.”\n\nLanhara pinched my cheek, “Yes, but you were leading us.”\n\nI furrowed my brows, “That doesn’t make sense.

And now it’s over. Now what?\n\n“Simple. Same thing we always did. We live,” Lanhara replied.\n\n“That’s it?” \n\n“That’s it.”\n\nI gave an uncertain hmm before considering what she said. But as my thoughts began to swirl, I felt Hara squeeze my hand before giving a laugh, “Oh Al, how did this happen?”\n\n“How did what happen?”\n\nShe shifted, forcing me to sit back up.

It was our doing. \n\nWith the clans restored and the woods at peace, the question of the future had hung over everyone. It was clear to everyone, even me, that we couldn’t go back to the old ways of each clan on its own, bickering when things came to head. That had nearly brought us ruin.\n\nYears of fighting together under the Verdant Pact had brought us together too. We weren’t just clans now, we were a people. A unified force just like our forebears were. All we needed was a commander, a ceannasaí. \n\nAnd that led us here. Most of the clan heads had a desire for the position. My eyes glanced over to Oberon Fealgarn who had settled on what I could only describe as a resting scowl. Some more than others, I thought. Yet, it wasn’t enough to want it. The other clans had to agree to it.\n\nI don’t know what Narawen said. And, in so many ways, I didn’t think I was the elf for it. But, after all these years, I had learned to think some but not too much.\n\nI pressed my fist against my chest, swearing to serve as Ceannasaí. To honor all of the clans, not just my own. To lead with courage and convection. And to defend our home against all that threatened it.\n\nIt was a short speech. I knew I couldn’t speak fancy, but as I spied Lanhara behind the clan heads, I also knew that was alright.
