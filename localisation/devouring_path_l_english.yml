 devouring_path.0.d:0 "In the province of [event_province.GetName], the Unbroken Claw school has taken root. This school teaches that strength is everything, and that fighting against one’s enemies is the way to their gods. They have decided that we, the followers of the Devouring Path, are those enemies. Ha! The fools know nothing of the danger of the Spirit Realm. We are saving them from an eternity of endless torture. They should thank us, but instead rebel against us. Should we do as they wish, and give them eternal torture, or show our kindness and save them?"

 devouring_path.1.d:0 "In the province of [event_province.GetName], many people follow the practice of worshipping their ancestors. This really shouldn’t be a problem, since we mourn our ancestors as well, who have gone to the Spirit Realm to be tortured for eternity. Therein lies the problem, however. The Ancestor Worshippers do not like the idea that their ancestors, even their Great Ancestors, have been tortured for millennia, and even now continue to be. They see it as a great insult, even though it is a terrible, terrible truth. What should be done for the Ancestor Worshippers?"
 devouring_path.1.a:0 "Show them the truth, and mourn alongside them"
