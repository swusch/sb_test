 L96_the_rival_city_title: "The Rival City"
 L96_the_rival_city_desc: "“The naga chose Sykar to be the one to lead the lizardfolk to the prophesied 333rd and final Empire. He was only two years old. I wasn’t even hatched yet. I have been forced my entire life to be a supporting cast member; to take the auxiliary forces and applaud my elder brother’s every conquest, every victory, even as they are handed to him on a plate. It was after his conquest of Zerat from that enfeebled penultimate empire that I could take it no longer. If I was to prove that I was capable of leading the final empire - to the naga, to my brother, to everyone - then I had to take the capital of a much stronger foe. Though my brother still thinks I’m doing this to further his ambition, once I claim the city of Karassk, all of lizardkind will know MY name. Katyradz Riverclaw: the TRUE heir to the throne of the Final Empire!”"

 L96_riverboats_on_the_sea_title: "Riverboats on the Sea"
 L96_riverboats_on_the_sea_desc: "The Arraskay Lizardfolk are a tribal people who have lived in the lands between the ancient Zerat empire and the many great lizardfolk city states that dot the coastline. Theirs is a more humble life, surviving in the dense jungles of Taneyas. Those of the Riverclaw line have a long tradition of riverboat trading, bringing goods between the coast and the mountains, growing much richer than their humble beginnings would suggest. Yet as we take our river canoes out into this new vast expanse of water, we’ve come to discover that perhaps what passes as adequate for river sailings does not translate to seaworthiness."

 L96_the_besieged_tribe_title: "The Besiged Tribe"
 L96_the_besieged_tribe_desc: "We do not question the merfolk when they ask for aid. We don’t know what it is that is attacking them beneath the waves as they will not tell us, and that is within their right. They rescued our new sailors when our first voyages on the sea ended in disaster. If we try to extract information now, we risk the wrath of the sea spirits who sent the merfolk to our aid. So now that they ask us to establish a military presence on a small island in the middle of the sea, our natural response is to accept, no questions asked. They would not tell us why anyway."

 L96_underwater_conflict_title: "Underwater Conflict"
 L96_underwater_conflict_desc: "The merfolk don’t tell us much, and we do not ask them to do so, but we can still infer much from what they do tell us - and what they strategically leave out. We know that the populations of merfolk this far north are sparse, with far more living further south. We also know that merfolk are far from a united empire. Territorial conflicts are not uncommon, and there can even be wars around faith and ideology. \n\nFrom what we can gather, it appears the merfolk that we have been aiding have committed some kind of grave sin, possibly involving magic. We don’t know what, and we do not judge. What we do know, thanks to Akhaxpa’s warning, is that our underwater protectors are going to be attacked and wiped out if we do not do something. Station troops in the shallow bay in Cheneskad. Those merfolk will soon learn that they aren’t the only ones familiar with underwater combat."

 L96_merfolk_magic_warfare_title: "Merfolk Magic Warfare"
 L96_merfolk_magic_warfare_desc: "It seems the merfolk tribe we assisted has become much more powerful under the sea. Although we do not know the full extent of their underwater conquests, it appears they have been blessed with a generation of gifted mages, who in turn have imbued their tridents and other weapons with extra magical powers. While we had some inkling that this was occurring, it was only when their Queen, a powerful mage in her own right, rose to the surface and gifted us with a magic trident, that our suspicions were confirmed. Our mages are fascinated by the trident, as its aquatic surges can detonate on impact, even underwater. Better yet, it has proven remarkably easy to copy and could be adapted as a weapon for our own ships."

 L96_eawuba_kayba_reef_title: "Eawuba Kayba Reef"
 L96_eawuba_kayba_reef_desc: "The words of Akhaxpa shook $MONARCH$ to their core. Whose guidance have we been following all this time? Who, or what, is the Herald of Change? Whoever they are, we cannot let it know we have been warned. No lizardfolk can know of this. Thankfully, there was one we can confide in: the Queen of our allied merfolk tribe - though to call it a tribe at this stage does incredible disservice to her ever-expanding underwater Kingdom. Perhaps their magical knowledge would help us uncover this herald. \n\nThe meeting was short. Her knowledge of the lizardfolk language was limited, and this conversation had to be done without a translator at hand, but as soon as the name of the Herald of Change was uttered, she quieted our $MONARCHTITLE$ as a dark look spread across her face. “I know this Herald -” she said, “- but we can not help. We do not, how you say, control Eawuba Kayba. It is a…forest. Magic. Fey. We do not control. But if you control land, we control sea.”"

 L96_the_herald_of_change_title: "The Herald of Change"
 L96_the_herald_of_change_desc: "The seas above the Eawuba Kayba Reef sparkle in the night with thousands upon thousands of ethereal lights. Add the reflection of the stars, and it shines almost as bright as though it were day. The faint noise of giggles can be heard riding the surf as the reeftide washes up onto the shore. Sail over these seas without care and you may find your hull has grown an entirely new tree, its roots reaching up into the sailor’s quarters. It is not a place anyone would normally dare venture.\n\nYet here $MONARCH$ stands, up to their waste on the shoreline, flanked by two merfolk. Our allies have secured us a passage deep into the reef, although they could find no merfolk willing to enter where they believe the passageway to the fey realm lies. On top of that, the magic staff gifted to our $MONARCHTITLE$ can only create an air bubble sufficient for a single person. So they go alone. To meet the Herald of Change. To tell it to stop."

 L96_end_the_ikilshebe_title: "End the Ikilshebe"
 L96_end_the_ikilshebe_desc: "Humans. Disgusting, vile, scaleless; violent without remorse nor thought. It was a divine mistake the day they learned how to smack two rocks together. If they had simply understood their place beneath us, perhaps they could have been left alive. But instead they hunted us. The humans in the lands to the west didn’t just drive out the ancient Irikin Lizardfolk culture, but they slaughtered us and wore our scales as gruesome trophies. Still today they push further. Deeper into our jungles they move. We cannot continue to treat them as pests. They are a threat to our proud civilization. They are a threat to all that is noble and right in this world. Crush them now, and feed their bodies to the tchokens. Their scaleless skin would not even make a suitable trophy."

 L96_proper_lumber_title: "Proper Lumber"
 L96_proper_lumber_desc: "Our first attempts at braving the seas were embarrassing. But let it never be said that Asarta loses heart when we meet with failure. It did not dissuade us when the naga chose Sykar to lead the lizardfolk to the Eternal Empire, nor would we be dissuaded because a few boats had their hulls crushed. We have the knowledge now of how to build more sturdy ships. Our stringy reed-reinforced river canoes are simply not suited to the open ocean. With multiple layers of thick lumber, we can take to the seas again, safe in the knowledge that the merfolk swim under us, guarding us from the worst case scenario."

 L96_scaled_seas_title: "Scaled Seas"
 L96_scaled_seas_desc: "It seems quaint now that our first voyage ended in such a disaster. Lizardfolk are naturals on the sea. Toss a human into the sea and laugh as he drowns. Toss a lizardfolk overboard and they will take to the change in environment effortlessly. With the merfolk protecting us underneath, we can make the entire Adzalaz Gulf ours. Ramp up production, deck our ships with the finest rope and sails that our shipbuilders can muster, and the seas will belong to Asarta!"

 L96_the_irikin_planes_title: "The Irikin Plains"
 L96_the_irikin_planes_desc: "It has been centuries since the Araizary last danced across the plains. They left with the lizardfolk, knowing humans would try to skin them too if they got their scaleless hands on them. These lands were once their home as much as it was ours. With the humans driven out, they can return. Araizarach, Home of the Araizary, can be reborn."

 L96_retake_our_spire_title: "Retake Our Spire"
 L96_retake_our_spire_desc: "The Zatsarya are sacred to the lizardfolk. Built by the very first lizardfolk empire, they are a sign that we are capable of incredible feats and that our people will reach this height once again. Yet the spire at Irikin has been defouled by the presence of humans. They swarm its base like rats at the bottom of a barrel. Their influence is a rot on those lands and on the great spire itself. We must cleanse it from their presence and return the Zatsarya back into our hands."

 L96_revive_irikin_culture_title: "Revive Irikin Culture"
 L96_revive_irikin_culture_desc: "While lizardfolk are generally at home in the jungle, that is not universally the case. The huge variety of mutations across lizardfolk means over the years we have adapted to every kind of environment. The old Irikin lizardfolk were more suited to the open plains of these rolling grasslands, with heat-resistant scales adapted to the lack of jungle canopies. \n\nThe Riverclaw tribes from which Asarta made its humble beginnings were originally formed by lizardfolk fleeing the onslaught of humans onto their lands, the old Karassian Empire failing to protect the region from those vermin. But lizardfolk are remarkably adaptable. New children born on the plains are more at home under the baking sun than the humid jungles of their grandparents. The old Irikin culture has been reborn."

 L96_correct_the_naga_title: "Correct the Naga"
 L96_correct_the_naga_desc: "The naga are not a centralised entity, but rather a network that shares ideas and knowledge. Even the lone naga who guides a single tribe must travel to seek wisdom from senior naga in large cities in order to better support their people. While consensus tends to gradually spread amongst the naga, it is not always absolute. There are naga in Asarta, after all, who now believe it was premature to believe Rayaz would be the prophesied unifier of all lizardfolk. We need to send those naga out to counteract the previous consensus that Taneyas would be united under Sykar Riverclaw and his sons.\n\nAnd if they side with Rayaz, we shall crush them too."

 L96_khateshala_answers_title: "Khateshala Answers"
 L96_khateshala_answers_desc: "Despite Katyradz's incredible declaration, an uneasiness still lingers amongst the court of Asarta. Why did the naga not choose us? What did they see or not see in us that led to us being looked over? We need answers. Search the spirits, the divine, anything that can look beyond the mortal world and see our fate. \n\nA good first step would be to speak to the unique lizardfolk of the Rankaty Islands. There resides a number of unique three-eyed lizardfolk whose extra pupil grants incredible magical powers of foresight. Even better, we’ve recently received word of a new three-eyed naga hatchling. The combination of the latent magical powers of all naga with the foresight granted by the third eye may mean we have a being capable of seeing fate itself and telling us how we can change ours. The name given to her is Akhaxpa - meaning She of Change. A good omen if ever there was one."

 L96_the_court_of_change_title: "The Court of Change"
 L96_the_court_of_change_desc: "The naga have proven unreliable. We will win them all over eventually, but for our goals we turn to the three-eyed naga, Akhaxpa, and her guidings. We must become the embodiment of change, for without that, the Eternal Empire will never be reached. She has advised us that we should look to the spirits for guidance and gather incense for her needs. She called such spirits “fey” in its usual roundabout way of speaking, but our mystics have figured out what it is referring to: the araizary. \n\nThe araizary are the benevolent spirits that have protected the lizardfolk ever since the 2nd Empire. They skip on the waves and dance along the rivers, guide lost lizardfolk in the dense jungles, and show us the meanings in the shiftings of the stars. Over time their importance to lizardfolk has waned, and we must correct that. Of all the araizary we know of, the Sahra are the ones that perhaps best embody the principles of “change”. Find the sweet smelling flower groves that the Sahra like to frequent deep in the Taneyas jungles and turn them into great shrines. Perhaps then we will receive their blessings. "

 L96_claim_the_prophecy_title: "Claim the Prophecy"
 L96_claim_the_prophecy_desc: "When Sykar Riverclaw took the great city of Zerat, he took it as a sign that he truly was the chosen one who would herald the coming of the 333rd Empire. Instead all it accomplished was the rise of Asarta, goading his younger brother, Katyradz, into action. Now here we stand, on top of all of Taneyas, with the great city under our grasp. We may not yet have united all lizardfolk, but we now know our rise is inevitable. Taneyas will change. The prophecy has changed. Both are ours now."

 L96_inscribe_our_legend_title: "Inscribe our Legend"
 L96_inscribe_our_legend_desc: "Since our empire will be eternal, every lizardfolk born to it should know how our legend began. They should know of Katyradz and how his fury and ambition drove him to denounce his brother and begin this vengeful path. They should know how we did not just unite the lizardfolk, but rebirthed the dead Irikin culture, for we will be the empire for all lizardfolk, past and present. \n\nAnd finally, they must know of the Herald of Change. Here is why we are doing this in secret. It must not know we are aware of it. We do not know what will happen when we confront the Herald. Its power may be beyond anything we can muster. So many empires were crushed before they began because they meddled with beings with the powers of gods. Alone, we can admit that we may not build the final empire. If we do not, the true heirs to the final empire must know why we fell. We challenged the Herald of Change. And if we do not fall, we can amend this tale with two final words: \n\nWe won."

 L96_the_greater_riverclaw_title: "The Greater Riverclaw"
 L96_the_greater_riverclaw_desc: "The day we proclaimed Rayaz to be our rival was bittersweet. The two brothers did not have to be enemies. If Sykar had recognised his sibling’s natural talents, the innate ability to rule, he would have recognised that he was not destined to unite the lizardfolk and should step down, as any true follower of the Anzalkatsa traditions should do. Instead we will be locked in endless conflict, through our children and through his children, generation after generation, until one of us cedes the right to rule."

 L96_quash_all_rayaz_loyalist_title: "Quash all Rayaz loyalist"
 L96_quash_all_rayaz_loyalist_desc: "In the Anzalkatsa tradition, if you are standing in the way of one who can do a task better than you, it is your moral obligation to stand aside and let them do it. We knew we could unite the lizardfolk. We knew Rayaz was the wrong choice. So we set out and proved that. Yet there are still those who wrongly believe Rayaz will rise again. Blasphemous naga support rebellious lizardfolk in our rightful territory.\n\nThe conclusion is simple: we must exterminate them. If when asked who should rule Asarta they do not say the Katyradz family line, then they must be treated in their ignorance like any other savage human trespassers upon Taneyas and slaughtered on the spot. Anyone brandishing the heraldry of the failed Sykar line, who professes their loyalty to Rayaz, must be eliminated. Drive every single one of them out of their fetid burrows and end them once and for all."

 #Events
 asarta.1.t: "Capsized Canoes"
 asarta.1.d: "It was the miscalculation of the century. These mere canoes were not made to handle waves like these. If the crew were closer to shore they could have swam - a little water does not scare a lizardfolk. But the Riverclaw clan simply never had to deal with conditions like this on the river. The storm was not even that strong, yet within scarcely half an hour, every single ship had capsized; their masts broken, their cargo trashed, their hulls in tatters. \n\nIt was at that moment that creatures emerged from the waters below. Fishlike bottom halves gave way to an almost humanoid upper body, albeit with scales and fins and multi-colored skin tones abound. At first the many stranded sailors panicked to see the creatures grab unconscious lizardfolk, believing they were taking their bodies to devour them below the waves. But as more of the creatures appeared, they carried with them ropes and strange floating devices. \n\nOne by one they dragged as many stranded lizardfolk as they could to various wooden contraptions, tied them fast, then started tossing ropes to various sea creatures they had brought with them, primarily dolphins. The seeming leader of the group, a stern-looking gentleman with a bright red fin atop his head, wordlessly pointed towards the shore, then demonstrated that they should hold on tight. With a loud whistle, the entire crew started swimming towards land, exhausted lizardfolk in tow. \n\nMiraculously, there were no deaths. At least a few crew members vowed to never leave the jungles again, nursing psychological wounds that would last years, but nothing more severe than that. The strange creatures never asked for anything. A more cynical observer could say our lost cargo at the bottom of the sea was theirs now and they needed no more payments. For most though, this was the most selfless act of bravery ever seen by any lizardfolk. There were people in the sea who would protect us. If anything, it made the sea feel safer."
 asarta.1.a: "We owe them our lives"

 asarta.2.t: "Underwater Politics"
 asarta.2.d: "The strange creatures beneath the sea that helped our stranded brethren have continued to fascinate the many new sailors of Asarta. We’ve since learned they are called merfolk, yet their origin remains mysterious. They don’t appear in the records of any historical lizardfolk empire, and even the old Karassian false empire referred to them more as pests than friends. \n\nFor us, they are guardians, even though they largely ignore our boats when we attempt to send messages. By now it has become standard practice for a new boat to first drop a weighted cargo box carrying various useful objects into the sea in the hopes it will prove useful to the merfolk. We do not bother them, for clearly they do not wish to be bothered. We know they look out for us, and that is all we need from them.\n\nWhich is why it was so surprising when almost a thousand merfolk arrived at the shoreline of Karassk. Through a merfolk translator who only knew a handful of lizardfolk words, they explained they needed a safe haven to build a new home just off the coast of our city, and would need supplies to accomplish this. They would not explain why. The most we got by way of explanation was they were under attack, and indeed a few of them sported clear wounds. \n\nBut we don’t need to know. They saved us without knowing anything about us. We must do the same."
 asarta.2.a: "Build them their settlement"

 asarta.3.t: "Merfolk Relations"
 asarta.3.d: "Ever since we gave the merfolk the materials they needed to build their underwater settlement, we’ve heard very little from them. Off the coast of Karassk you will see lights sparkle beneath the waves, and curious younger merfolk will approach our vessels, diving shyly back underwater if anyone onboard tries to speak with them.\n\nSome worry that we have offended them somehow. Further research into historical records shows the merfolk have always been secretive. Perhaps it is in their nature, or perhaps poor treatment by the hands of the old Karassian Empire means they have been taught to not trust lizardfolk. \n\nWhatever their reasons, we will respect their privacy and not enquire until they are ready to open up to us. It would be bad luck to do so. Whatever spirits have blessed our boats to be saved by the merfolk would likely abandon us if we betrayed their trust. The humans skinned us when they met us. The merfolk saved us. We repay both in kind."
 asarta.3.a: "We protect them as they protect us"

 asarta.4.t: "The Deep Attacks"
 asarta.4.d: "The bay in Cheneskad turned into a lagoon at low tide as the sandbank rose above the water. For the bay itself, the water level dropped off, with the merfolk settlement laying at the bottom. The attack was going to arrive at high tide, that much was obvious. Only at that time could the rival merfolk attack. \n\nOur ships lay outside the bay, waiting for the signs of merfolk swimming underneath. Once they gave the signal, the ships would turn and sail towards the bay, lizardfolk leaping into the shallower waters by the sand spit to fight. In deep water we wouldn’t stand a chance. But in five feet of water, they would learn that the Arraskay Lizardfolk are more than capable of aquatic warfare.\n\nOn the boat stood our $MONARCHTITLE$. By [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side stood a hydromancer, ready to give the signal, and Akhaxpa, her three eyes closed. It was as quiet as you could get on the sea. The creaking of the boat as waves lapping against it was one of the few ever-present sounds, as was the sounds of seagulls cawing overhead. Then a murmur started to spread. Lizardfolk peered over the side of the boat, as did $MONARCH$. It was hard to make out, but there was movement. The merfolk were here.\n\n$MONARCH$ raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand and the crew silenced, shuffling into position. A few grabbed weapons and prayed that the araizary of the sea may protect them. The hydromancer held his staff aloft and waited. Then, after the last merfolk passed under the ship, the $MONARCHTITLE$ dropped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arm and yelled."
 asarta.4.a: "ATTACK!!!"

 asarta.5.t: "The First Wave"
 asarta.5.d: "The ambush was a massive success! The ships had pulled into the bay and a feast had started, with at least 50 roast tchokens all prepared for the crews. No merfolk joined in - although many did raise their heads above the water to watch. They had joined the battle too to defend their village, resulting in a pincer attack that left the attacking merfolk with nowhere to retreat. \n\n“Should they not be celebrating too?” asked one of the $MONARCHTITLE$’s generals. “The threat to their village has ended. If this is not worthy of a celebration, surely nothing is.” The $MONARCHTITLE$ slapped the general on the back and responded in between bites of roasted tchoken: “Do not worry about them. We should not intrude on their culture, for they don’t intrude on ours. They may feel the need to mourn their dead before any celebra-”\n\nThe $MONARCHTITLE$’s words were cut off by a sudden sharp scream from Akhaxpa. Her eyes shot open, light bursting out, brighter than the cooking fires across the camp. She turned to the $MONARCH$, her long tail end wrapping around his leg as she started speaking hurriedly. “They will return. A force far greater and more powerful. That attack was merely a scouting force. The next will be their entire army. This is an extermination mission. They will not rest until this village is wiped out. They believe they are too dangerous.\n\n“They are coming. I do not know when. One year, two years. But they will come. And they will wipe everyone out.” With that final declaration, Akhaxpa shut her eyes and slumped back to the ground."
 asarta.5.a: "We’re going to need a bigger army stationed on this island…"

 asarta.6.t: "The Onslaught"
 asarta.6.d: "A panicked lizardfolk rushed into the war room on Cheneskad. The merfolk were here! Thousands, possibly tens of thousands, were spotted out under the sea. One scouting ship had narrowly escaped. They were heading towards Cheneskad, and high tide was in a few hours. "
 asarta.6.a: "Every lizard to their stations!"

 asarta.7.t: "A Free Settlement"
 asarta.7.d: "Thousands upon thousands of lizardfolk had arrived on Cheneskad. They said it would be a party that would be spoken about for generations. Entire new businesses had arisen overnight on the once-sparsely populated island. New traders arrived, with the original landowners selling their humble farms for huge profits as rich merchants wanted to use the island for rare spice plantations, the soil on the island being uniquely suited to it.\n\nOn the other side of the island, far away from the growing city and the revelling stood a small delegation: the $MONARCHTITLE$, their guards and advisors, and Akhaxpa. Opposite them in shallow water was a group of merfolk. The locals knew enough about the village that they could identify that this was the royal family. No guards, no advisors. Just the king, queen, and their younger daughter. \n\nThe King raised his body as best he could in the shallow water and spoke in a heavily accented and halting lizardfolk language: “Thank you for help. We are…thanking...” He hoisted his body higher using his staff as leverage. At its tip lay what appeared to be a gem of pure damestear. “We not need help again. We…are…” he turned and looked awkwardly at his family. The Queen and King started speaking in hushed voices in their merfolk tongue, getting gradually angrier, before suddenly the younger daughter interrupted and pointed at Akhaxpa.\n\n“That thing told you. It knew.” Gasps erupted on both sides, with lizardfolk awkwardly shuffling in the shallow water. The King muttered and stumbled forward to grab his daughter, but she pulled herself out of the water entirely where he could not reach. “How did it know?” $MONARCH$ knelt down, face to face with the young merfolk. “Because it can see things we cannot see. It can see the future - or a future that will occur if we do not change it.” \n\nThe young merfolk, seemingly satisfied with the answer, pulled herself back into the water and swam back to her furious-looking parents. With one last look at the lizardfolk delegation, she waved back at them, before she disappeared below the surface of the water once again."
 asarta.7.a: "I wonder if we’ll see her again"

 asarta.8.t: "Meeting the Herald of Change"
 asarta.8.d: "$MONARCH$ dove off below the water, following the merfolk guides as they warded off water nymphs that made this fey-reef their home. But as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] swam into a deeper patch of reef and coral, they too backed up. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] swam deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and then...shallower? Why was [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] now swimming upwards? Something was wrong. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] panicked, kicking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legs to get right way up, until it felt like the ground rose up under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legs and they breached the surface of the water. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] coughed up water, then felt around for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] staff, and slowly started to take in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] surroundings. They were on land for some reason. The coral had given away to a dense thicket of twisted trees with lights glistening between them. And in the very centre of this clearing, looking down upon this almost drowned lizard, was a gigantic moth with a white mask where its face may be. Behind those eyes shone blinding blue lights.\n\n“You are quite the fool,” said a voice that seemed to emanate from both the moth and everywhere at once. “You really did try to swim to the feyrealm. If I hadn’t already known you were coming, you would have simply gotten lost and taken by the nymphs. I don’t know how you found out about me… the merfolk, perhaps.” $MONARCH$ hauled themselves up on their feet. “You’re the Herald of Change. I come with a demand. Leave the lizardfolk alone. We don’t need your help anymore.”\n\nLaughter reverberated around the clearing, with soft giggling noises mingling with the loud guffaws of the Herald. “Need me? You don’t need any help destroying yourselves. I’ve seen it over and over again. You are no different. Your kind desires change, and there can be no change in your eternal empire you wish for. But…” The Herald paused and the giggling that emanated endlessly from the trees quietened. “You could become the essence of change yourself. Your kind already mutates over generations, a most fascinating trait. This would simply be…speeding up the process.\n\n“Accept my offer. Take the pact and become changelings. For if your empire is to be eternal, everyone in it should be eternally changing.”"
 asarta.8.a: "Become Changelings"
 asarta.8.b: "Punch the Herald of Change in the face"

 asarta.9.t: "Changelings "
 asarta.9.d: "The light behind the Herald’s mask glowed brighter than ever before, before fading into blackness. The light around the thicket dimmed and the ground itself began to shake. $MONARCH$ fell to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] knees, clutching their wrist in horror. In front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] claw began to mutate, sharp daggers of pain shooting across [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire body. Scales hardened then started to peel off. Feathers sprouted across the arms before withering. A giant sickle-like claw grew out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palm. Another eye sprouted on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face - then a second, then another pair on either side. The pain was so blinding $MONARCH$ collapsed on the ground, eyes shut tight - however many of them they had now - and just screamed.\n\nGradually, suddenly, after an eon and no time at all, it just stopped. All pain ceased. Shaking and standing up, $MONARCH$ felt…different. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legs were longer, arms shorter but more muscular. The coloration on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] scales had shifted entirely. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked up at the Herald, whose masked face gave no emotion, but the voice it spoke with gave some hints. Not joy, but perhaps pride?\n\n“Go, my changeling. You and all your kind. You are now beings of pure change. Go and become the agents of change for all of Halann, and perhaps even beyond.”"
 asarta.9.a: "Rise of the Changelings"

 asarta.10.t: "Why Did the Naga Deny Our Destiny"
 asarta.10.d: "“BEGONE!”\n\n$MONARCH$ hurled a javelin above the head of the latest messenger, who screamed, ducked, and swiftly scurried out of the $MONARCH$’s chambers. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors shifted nervously where they stood. An individual naga that rejected our claim to the prophecy could be dismissed. Any naga still within Rayaz could be understood too as not wanting to change sides so swiftly. But for every single naga council we sent a delegation to dismiss our offer…\n\nSomething was wrong. Taneyas needed change. The lizardfolk needed change. Most of all, the naga needed to change. The scant few naga who sided with Katyradz were not enough to convince all lizardfolk that we are the ones who will claim the prophecy. If we continued like this, we would end up like Karassk: a vast kingdom yet nevertheless never recognised as an “empire” by the naga, and therefore not eligible for the prophecy and rejected by the rest of the Lizardfolk. We may have claimed the city of Karassk but we do not want to claim their legacy too.\n\nThere is one lead we can follow up on, though. We did get one naga to side with Asarta: a defector from Karshyr. One naga does not move the needle much, but they did alert us to a naga who could. On the Rankaty Islands a three-eyed naga hatched recently, blessed with the incredible power to speak to the spirits beyond our vision. In communion with such spirits this hatchling can access all prophesied futures, speak to those who know all pasts, and can guide us to the one path where we claim the prophecy for ourselves. Perhaps this three-eyed hatchling has the answers we seek."
 asarta.10.a: "Seek out this mystical naga"

 asarta.11.t: "The Mystic Herald"
 asarta.11.d: "Our $MONARCHTITLE$ was led into the hut where the young three-eyed naga lived. The room was filled with incense so stifling it made it hard to breathe or even see. There on a large embroidered cushion sat Akhaxpa, the naga. She was limbless, like all other naga, but with her eyes closed it was hard to make out whether she had the third eye. As $MONARCH$ kneeled down across from her, she unfurled her snakelike body without opening her eyes, and raised her head until it was face-to-face with $MONARCH$. \n\n“You will not bring change”, she declared, opening all three of her eyes, each one shining like a beacon of pure blue light from behind the sockets. It temporarily blinded $MONARCH$, who squinted back to try to look the naga in the face again. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had met some of the unique three-eyed khateshala lizardfolk since arriving on the Rankaty Islands, but none of them had eyes that glowed like this. \n\n“I can bring change”, $MONARCH$ stammered out, before taking a deep breath to calm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nerves. “I have already changed the course of history from that which the other naga said would come to pass. I ended the Karassian Empire. If that is not enough, then tell me. Tell me how I can become one who can bring change to Taneyas.” \n\nAkhaxpa brought her face closer until her eyes were gazing directly into $MONARCH$’s face, blinding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] so thoroughly [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could see nothing but the pure light blue glow. Time felt like it stood still as whispers and giggles played through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. The room felt like it was falling away, as though [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was entering an entirely different plane. Then slowly, it all faded back into view, and the naga backed up, narrowed her eyes, and smiled.\n\n“You have done the first thing you needed to do. You have changed my mind.”"
 asarta.11.a: "What was that!?!"

 asarta.12.t: "Adding to the Myths: The Prophecy"
 asarta.12.d: "$MONARCH$ sat alone in the chamber. The ornate writing table [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sat before was carved from marble, with upwards of 50 different inkwells around the outside. Although most bureaucrats and merchants used the more modern, and frankly dumbed-down four-color writing language, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt that all historical records should be written in the traditional lizardfolk style with its huge array of colors. How else could one convey the complexity of language? Without color, one's words could be mistaken as sarcasm or anger when it was never intended. Such a thing would make communication through the written word alone fraught with danger! \n\nBut what colors to use? What of the prophecy, and how our journey all started when Katyradz defied it? How do we want his legacy to be remembered?"
 asarta.12.a: "Red, the color of vengeance"
 asarta.12.b: "Navy, as this was fated"
 asarta.12.c: "Bright green, as this was an astute action"

 asarta.13.t: "Adding to the Myths: Irikin"
 asarta.13.d: "Then what of Irikin? What of the cleansing of our lands of humans? If we do not write this correctly, one might view us as monsters. An evil that committed an atrocity. Sometimes the men talk of their nightmares at what they committed, one that no reminder of our natural place above the humans seems to scrub. The right words could justify our actions, especially with the right color."
 asarta.13.a: "Red, the color of vengeance"
 asarta.13.b: "Navy, as this was fated"
 asarta.13.c: "Bright green, as this was an astute action"

 asarta.14.t: "Adding to the Myths: The Court of Change"
 asarta.14.d: "What of the court of change? The change we brought to Taneyas, and the guidance of Akhaxpa we followed? More importantly, what of the Herald of Change? How do we speak of this? Do we dare even put its name to writing? If it could tell that the merfolk village was to be attacked, does it know that this will be written? Why did we follow its orders? Was it always fated to go like this? Or was this the correct course of action all along and it just took this Herald to help us see?\n\nLooking over their shoulder, the $MONARCH$ took the quill and selected a color with which to begin chronicling this most delicate part of our tale. "
 asarta.14.a: "Red, the color of vengeance"
 asarta.14.b: "Navy, as this was fated"
 asarta.14.c: "Bright green, as this was an astute action"

 asarta.15.t: "Adding to the Myths: Final"
 asarta.15.d: "Storing the records of empires was a ritualistic process, but it was one borne out of a desire to keep those records secure. First the parchment was dipped in the translucent sap of a tree native to Taneyas, which dried the ink and preserved it. Then a new heavy stone container was unearthed, the lid removed, and the records placed delicately inside. With a final push, the stone slid back into place, ready to be preserved. \n\nThe process had not changed for thousands upon thousands of years. The Herald was not here. Even the Herald could not change that. $MONARCH$ saw this as almost a final act of resistance against the tyranny of the seer. Here, the lizardfolk traditions do not change.\n\n$MONARCH$ could see the image of the Herald before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]; in the silence of the archive, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] spoke to them. You cannot stop this act of memory. Nor can you stop our eternity through your want of never-ending change. Our legend has been written. You cannot change that now."
 asarta.15.a: "We will fulfill the prophecy"
 
 asarta.16.t: "Punch the Herald"
 asarta.16.d: "The Herald screeched and recoiled backwards, its giant wings frantically fluttering as it fell to the ground. “How dare you, how dare you, how dare you”, it shrieked over and over again. After a few seconds of repeated shrieking and fluttering, it was able to get back into the air and turn back to the lone lizardfolk that had just punched an archfey in the face. In the middle of the Herald’s mask ran a giant crack. “What was your plan then? Did you come here simply to hit me? The incomprehensible stupidity of your kind is beyond even my foresight. What was this going to accomplish?” \n\n$MONARCH$ clenched [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fist, blood dripping down [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palm. “I want my people to rise above all. I do not want our fate to hinge on the whim of otherworldly beings. I want us to take it ourselves. In short”, $MONARCH$ grinned, looking the giant moth in the face as its mask slowly splitting along the crack, “I wanted change.” \n\nThe light behind the Herald’s mask shone brighter than ever before, filling $MONARCH$’s vision entirely. The ground gave way beneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] fell. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] fell and fell for so long that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consciousness gave way, the light so blinding it sapped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of all consciousness. After…hours? Days? Weeks? Something awoke [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]: a strong smell of incense.\n\n$MONARCH$ looked up into the eyes of Akhaxpa. There was no light behind them. Just three slitted pupils with tinges of yellow and green. She smiled and simply said…"
 asarta.16.a: "Thank you"

 asarta.17.t: "The Son of Sykar"
 asarta.17.d: "He didn't even flinch when $MONARCH$ pointed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear inches from his face. The son of Sykar. The one who instigated these rebellions. The one $MONARCH$ had just crushed in its entirety. Yet he just sat there in his dungeon cell, calmly staring down the shaft of $MONARCH$'s spear, as though there was nothing to fear.\n\n"Have you accepted that the prophecy has changed then". $MONARCH$ lowered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear and knelt in front of the deposed son. "That the naga were wrong. That your father was wrong. Have you accepted that you must step aside to fulfil the prophecy like a true follower of Anzalkatsa?"\n\nThe son smiled grimly. "I know all about you and your mad goals in the name of bringing change. Incomprehensible nonsense, chasing shadows due to a legacy of rejection. This pursuit of a mythic force of change is folly, a coping mechanism to deal with my father being chosen over you. You will be just another failure in a list of pretenders to the throne. You will not bring chan-"\n\nHis final words were cut short as $MONARCH$ thrust [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear through his nephew's throat, his last words of defiance stuttering to a gurgling halt."

 asarta.101.d: "A thick smog of incense filled the room where the Court of Change resided. At its centre, laid out on an array of cushions, resided Akhaxpa. As the $MONARCHTITLE$ approached her and knelt down, she opened her three eyes, filling the room with a blinding blue light.\n\n“I see you have brought change to the great spires of these lands. But what you have done is not enough. You must change your attention from one to another. Focus your eyes on a single monument alone, and your rule shall be a monument to failure.”"

In that I commend you. But what of these lands when you pass? Do you truly believe you leave your nation in the hands of change, or has your heir merely been taught to mimic what you do?

It still burned bright blue as it always did, but there were shifting colors behind it this time.\n\n“I see the Night Hags have been on the move again. On some level I appreciate what they are doing. Without their advances, these lands will never change. They destroy, then retreat, and kingdoms are rebuilt anew. That is change, but it is a short-term change. For I know their goals. I can see the future they desire. A merging of the shadow plane with ours. The end of all life as the shadows absorb all.”\n\nAkhaxpa glared at $MONARCH$. “You have to stop them.

 asarta.150.d: "A thick smog of incense filled the room where the Court of Change resided. At its centre, laid out on an array of cushions, resided Akhaxpa. As the $MONARCHTITLE$ approached her and knelt down, she opened her three eyes, filling the room with a blue light, albeit dimmer than usual.\n\n“They are in danger”. Akhaxpa spoke in a much softer tone this time. Behind the light of her eyes, dark slitted pupils could be seen moving. “Other merfolk are not happy with their actions. Not for saving your sailors, but something else. A forbidden magic. Ostracization is not enough.”\n\n“Those in Karassk are safe, but not by the island of Cheneskad. If you do not act, they will all die. Every single one will be slaughtered, their village destroyed, and their children’s corpses left to rot on the seafloor.” Akhaxpa paused, then the bright blue light behind their eyes grew brighter and their voice subtly changed. “They fear change under the sea. They won’t attack yet, as they lack allies. Time is on your side. With your help, change both above and below sea level can be achieved.”"
 asarta.150.a: "We can save them"

 asarta.151.t: "Merfolk Relations"
 asarta.151.d: "$MONARCH$ entered the room where Court of Change resided, but something was different. The usual smog of incense was not there, although its strong smell remained. The Akhaxpa was in her usual spot, but her eyes were different. The third eye was closed, and the two remaining ones had no light behind them. Instead there were slitted pupils, typical of any naga. Before the $MONARCHTITLE$ could even kneel down, she started speaking in a hurried tone.\n\n“It will not stop. It does not want your empire to last. It wants change, and that change includes destroying you. Nothing you can do can stop it. You cannot appease it forever. Once it tires of you, it will turn to other methods to destroy you. You have to-”. She shut her eyes tight and slumped to the ground. Light started shining dimly from behind her sockets. Akhaxpa started writhing, her snakelike body contorting and twisting around itself, until finally she lifted her body back up and started speaking in an even more hurried tone.\n\n“You have not been speaking to me. You have been speaking to the Herald of Change; a powerful being from beyond this plane. It does not know I am talking to you right now. Listen to me: it is no friend of you nor the lizardfolk. It delights in the destruction of lizardfolk over and over again, for in its eyes, each rise and fall brings change to us, the chaos on which it feeds.” She slumped to the ground, her eyes narrowing, while a blue glow started growing behind her closed third eye. \n\n“Go to Ardimya. In the oceans off the coast you will find a spot where you can traverse the planes and meet the Herald. I don’t know how you stop it. It will not listen to reaso-”. She screamed and writhed on the floor again. The blue light started emanating from beneath her scales. With the last strength she could muster she blurted out: “Whatever you do, make sure you punch it in the face from me. I can’t do it. After all, I don’t have arms.”\n\nWith a final smile she slumped to the floor. There was a moment of stillness before all three of her eyes shot open, the blinding blue light emanating from them, stronger than ever before. She raised her head and gazed at the $MONARCHTITLE$. “I do apologise, you appear to have found me when I have fainted. My only request for you is to send in one of my helpers to refill these burners. It appears my incense has run out.”"
 asarta.151.a: "Yes I definitely found you in here, fainted, and nothing else"

 asarta.201.t: "Changelings"
 asarta.201.d: "Do we even resemble lizardfolk anymore? As arms morph and twist, legs grow and strengthen, eyes weaken while hearing intensifies, our form is barely recognisable to that of lizardfolk not 20 years ago. We are changelings, and in every new form lie our power."
