 lizard.1.t:0 "Ravaged By Blood"
 
 lizard.1.d:0 "A group of Ashhana Lizardfolk in [raging_crocs_province.GetName] have become ravenous, consumed by the savage desire for blood. Nobody knows how it started; perhaps it was a plot by a hag, a violent argument or just bad music. Whatever it was, they are wreaking havoc across our province nonetheless."
 
 lizard.1.a:0 "Send the army."
 
 lizard.1.b:0 "Send no one, the locals can handle it themselves."
 
 lizard.1.c:0 "Send an artist to calm them down."
 
 
 lizard.2.t:0 "A Soothing Sound"
 
 lizard.2.d:0 "It appears that the Ashhana of [soothing_sound_province.GetName] are more cordial and productive than usual. Upon further investigation, the cause seems to be a very talented artist. Their craft has caused the villagefolks' blood curse to become muted, no longer are they constantly bothered by the whispers of bloodthirst."
 
 lizard.2.a:0 "They should dedicate his talent to everyone in our country."
 
 lizard.2.b:0 "Let him stay where his heart wishes."
 
 
 lizard.3.t:0 "Halflings hold festival of Drongay"

 lizard.3.d:0 "The halflings in one of our provinces have held a festival to one of their Gods, in this case the God of lizardfolk, Drongay, and our people have taken notice of this. Some have chosen to attend the festival, and have been met by a kind host supplying them with ample food, drink, and entertainment, which has led to a great deal of merriment prevailing the land. \nThe festival there may be drawing to a close, but if we offer to step in with some funding, we could increase the scale to a country-wide celebration, which could help encourage cooperation between us and our halfling subjects on a larger scale. We lizardfolk may not be known for our fanciful festivities, but we see the practicality of such things."

 lizard.3.a:0 "Very good."

 lizard.3.b:0 "A larger festival, should we pay for it, could reap larger rewards."

 
 lizard.4.t:0 "Bakoly Boldsong"
 
 lizard.4.d:0 "Some years ago, a halfling by the name of Bakoly Boldsong departed our lands for Fahvanosy, in search of the Mihipha college in order to become a renowned bard. Few paid much notice outside of her local farming village, which hosted a goodbye celebration. But over the last few months, it has become clear she has returned, and with quite the skill. \nEvery song she sings appears to prove an earworm for even the most stoic and stonehearted of individuals, and her touring all over the countryside of [Root.Country.GetName]’ has done much to raise the spirits of our people. We lizardfolk admire musicians and artists as much as any other people do, and we therefore praise the work of such an impressive bard. \nEven so, perhaps her talents are wasted in taverns and town centres. Having a bard of that fame in our court, especially one hailing from our lands, would do much to raise our prestige. Alternatively, we could pay her to focus on attending farmsteads and plantations to raise their productivity, which could do much to give us a more tangible reward for being the homeland of Bakoly Boldsong."

 lizard.4.a:0 "Let her continue to tour around the countryside."

 lizard.4.b:0 "We could use a bard of such renown in our court."
 
 lizard.4.c:0 "Paying her to sing at farms and plantations could give us a more tangible benefit."


 lizard.5.t:0 "Insider clove trading"

 lizard.5.d:0 "It appears that a halfling family in our land, possessed of clove farming cousins, has been able to buy the ridiculously expensive spice at a far cheaper price than foreign merchants leading to massive profits. \nNow that we’ve found this out, the only question is how we shall gain from this. The obvious answer would be taxing them, curbing their profits but giving us a large pile of gold. The second answer would be simply to let them continue untaxed, as the cheap cloves have begun to attract merchants to our ports. Finally, we could choose to hire the halfling responsible for this, as perhaps we could make good use of a trader with connections to Favhanosy clove farmers?"

 lizard.5.a:0 "Leave them untaxed, the cheap cloves will attract merchants like flies to honey."

 lizard.5.b:0 "Tax them, I want to skim a little off the top now, not later."

 lizard.5.c:0 "Perhaps their connections can be exploited by us a little more directly."


 lizard.6.t:0 "Our Marathon Candidate"

 lizard.6.d:0 "The Favhanosy marathon, a rather strange tradition to us, has nonetheless become an international event amongst halflings, who travel from as far away as Aelantir and Cannor to take part. \nRecently, one of our halflings is becoming renowned for all the training they have done as preparation, to the point where many of our lizardfolk subjects have begun to regard his participation in the marathon with a kind of national pride. Many of our people hope he will achieve a great victory in the event, and that he will bring pride to [Root.Country.GetName]. Of course, few of us have any idea of what exactly the tradition entails, but it has certainly whipped up a lot of excitement. "

 lizard.6.a:0 "May he earn victory!"

 lizard.6.b:0 "To represent [Root.Country.GetName]’ in the Summer Isles, we shall celebrate to make this honour known!"

 lizard.7.t:0 "Brothers in Conflict"
 lizard.7.d:0 "The time of the 333rd Empire is close at hand. The naga chose Sykar Riverclaw of Rayaz to be the Sovereign who will lead the lizardfolk in this new age. Such an arrangement is laughable. He has had every victory handed to his nation on a silver platter. Meanwhile we are the ones who took the great city of Karassk against all odds. We have proven our worth.\n\nIt’s time to end this farce. Send a delegation to Rayaz. This alliance is over. From this point on, we are enemies. We will not rest until they have been crushed. We are the ones who will lead the lizardfolk into the dawn of its greatest era!"
 lizard.7.a:0 "For Asarta! For Katyradz!"

 lizard.8.t:0 "Betrayal"
 lizard.8.d:0 "To think it started with delight. As news spread to Rayaz of the capture of Karassk by Asarta forces, a celebration was planned coinciding with the expected arrival of a delegation from Asarta in the capital. The families would convene, share a feast, and discuss plans for the future ruling of lizardfolk.\n\nInstead they brought only news of betrayal. Asarta has stabbed the alliance through the heart and announced that they will not rest until Rayaz has fallen. No war has been declared, but from this point on they are naught but sworn enemies. No 333rd Empire can be formed as long as the other still stands."
 lizard.8.a:0 "Cold-blooded."

 lizard.9.t:0 "The Claims of Arazin"
 lizard.9.d:0 "The unity of the Riverclaws is no more. The Asartas secession from our alliance creates a unique political opportunity which cannot be underestimated. If we want to make any moves, this is the right time to act. \n\nThe tribes of Yushyn are known for their rebelliousness and unbroken sense of identity. Before the war, they were asked by Rayaz to rebel against the Zerat in a joint attempt to break the Anzara. They expected independence, but the administration of Sykar didn’t leave them a bit of it in the end, establishing their own garrisons and keeping important figures under house arrest. These areas are a ticking time bomb that waits to explode just at the right moment. \n\nWe shall offer our service to Rayaz and claim the provinces of Verthica and Tsaratokh, offering to act as a buffer against the Yushyn. And if they decline… well, maybe the relationship between our tribes won’t be as profitable for us anymore."
 lizard.9.a:0 "It will be your choice whether you go with or against us."

 lizard.10.t:0 "A Notice From Arazin"
 lizard.10.d:0 "As if we weren’t already in an unfortunate situation after Asarta broke our family’s bonds, we got a message from Arazin. Under the guise of offering themselves as a barrier against a possible Yushyni rebellion, they demand access to the provinces of Tsaratokh and Verthica. \n\nWhile their arguments are valid, they are fully aware how much we’ve tried to centralize our holds to make a unified push against Anzara. To make matters worth, they indirectly suggested this is a matter worth breaking our alliance over! \n\nCan’t they see the bigger picture? They just put us in a lose-lose situation: either succumb and risk the other parties following up with their demands or decline and damage the stability of our coalition further!"
 lizard.10.a:0 "Concede, it will stay in family either way."
 lizard.10.b:0 "We shall not back down, not now."

 lizard.11.t:0 "Asarta Alone"
 lizard.11.d:0 "Today, we got fresh news from our sources in Rayaz. Our brethren in Arazin have pushed their claims to Tsaratokh against Rayaz and unfortunately for us, Rayaz has conceded. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been angry ever since the news broke out. Rightfully so, as it seems that the only window to secure one more ally for our cause just slipped between our fingers."
 lizard.11.a:0 "An unfortunate chain of events."

 lizard.12.t:0 "Claim Fulfilled"
 lizard.12.d:0 "Good news, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! Our claim to Tsaratokh has been addressed positively and we’ve been granted control over the territories!"
 lizard.12.a:0 "I love you, [Root.Monarch.GetSisterBrother]."

 lizard.13.t:0 "Claim Denied"
 lizard.13.d:0 "Grave news, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our claim to Tsaratokh has been denied. The only way to reclaim what is ours rests on receiving support from other tribes, but luckily there’s a candidate that we’ve been waiting to reconcile with."
 lizard.13.a:0 "Dear Asartas brothers..."

 lizard.14.t:0 "An Unexpected Ally"
 lizard.14.d:0 "...You’re not the only ones that hold a grudge towards the Rayazas. Ever since their elites got infiltrated by nagas, they took away our rights to our rightful lands in Tsaratokh. Time after time, our pleas to come back got pushed aside to the point where our patience has run out. We ask to join your cause, to crush the selfish and arrogant siblings of ours and create a new Riverclaw alliance, one where Arazin and Asarta lead the way to a new empire.\n\nYour dear [L97.Monarch.GetSisterBrother],\n[L97.Monarch.GetName] Riverclaw"
 lizard.14.a:0 "Everyone is welcome to conspire against common enemies."
 lizard.14.b:0 "The felling of Rayaz is our duty and our alone."

 lizard.15.t:0 "Out in The Cold"
 lizard.15.d:0 "The worst case scenario manifested itself. In pursuit of our own ambitions, we’ve been left behind by both our siblings and now we find ourselves encircled by hostile powers. With no one to protect us, we can only hope that our demise comes later rather than sooner."
 lizard.15.a:0 "We brought this fate upon ourselves and now we pay the price."

 lizard.16.t:0 "What Could've Been"
 lizard.16.d:0 "The split in our family was a blow that none of us expected. Yet, not everything fell in the worst possible way. The traitors’ alliance did not come to reality, as Asartas denied the offer of Arazin to join them in a common effort against us. We can only be happy that there’s still an opportunity to divide and conquer the rebellious tribes."
 lizard.16.a:0 "A drop of happiness in the sea of misery."

 lizard.17.t:0 "Setting A Precendent"
 lizard.17.d:0 "The split in our family was a blow that none of us expected. One by one Asarta and Arazin distanced themselves from us, as now they formed an alliance, united by their shared resentment towards us.\n\nAs we aspire to claim the title of the final empire, this cannot be the conflict that takes us down. We shall bring vengeance to our brethren for their insubordination and bring them under our heel once again, this time directly under our management."
 lizard.17.a:0 "We shall make an example out of them."

###Ashhana Lizardfolk###

 ashhana_tribe:0 "Ashhana Tribe"
 ashhana_tribe_desc:0 "Although loose, Ashhana tribes do have a central ruling authority. Their primary role is to gather an army to defend the tchoken farmers that make up most of Ashhana society in case of human, troll, or other lizardfolk raids. Rallying forces is not difficult, as the bloodcurse-fuelled rage makes it easy to conscript entire villages to defend their territory, but this is not a system that scales well the more villages come under the chief’s control."
 war_as_art:0 "War as Art"
 war_as_art_desc:0 "What is art? The first Ashhana who discovered art could clear their mind of the blood curse did so by listening to a bard and their music. Others have branched out into painting or sculpting. But those are far too narrow a definition. Anything whose existence is more than utilitarian and whose purpose extends to aesthetics can be seen as art. Even the act of battle itself can be found artistic expression."
 rally_to_the_roar:0 "Rally to the Roar"
 rally_to_the_roar_desc:0 "The Ashhana will perish if the other lizardfolk ever unify enough to drive us out of our homes. The roar is not just a physical bellow, but a cry for the Ashhana people. We go to war, and every crocodile must play their part."
 spread_the_cure:0 "Spread the Cure"
 spread_the_cure_desc:0 "The bliss of a cleared mind must be shared by all. The bloodcurse can not be said to be cured if only those in the chieftans lodge know that it is through art that your rage can be sated. It must be spread to every village in our territory."
 crocadilian_unity:0 "Crocodilian Unity"
 crocadilian_unity_desc:0 "Do you know what other lizardfolk call us? Monsters. They refer to us in the same degrading language one usually reserves for trolls. If that is what they call us, then perhaps we should do our best to live up to that moniker."
 paintbrushes_for_everyone:0 "Paintbrushes for Everyone"
 paintbrushes_for_everyone_desc:0 "To perceive art is to touch divinity. To create it is a divine act. Anyone is capable of the divine, but simply lacks the tools to achieve it. Paintbrushes are the simplest tool of the artist. Create thousands and send them to every Ashhana. Then even the lowliest tchoken farmer can become divine."
 festivals_of_blood:0 "Festivals of Blood"
 festivals_of_blood_desc:0 "Many who follow Zaradyrra do so for the sense of community. It's not just about the art, but the festivals that celebrate the art. For those who see the bliss in embracing the blood rage, similar festivals in which you allow yourself to be consumed by it can be liberating."
 free_our_souls:0 "Free Our Souls"
 free_our_souls_desc:0 "For a millennia or more, our souls have been bound to the blood curse. Society, culture, civilisation, all have failed as the rage consumed us. But no more! We have found the cure to that burden the Hags burned into our beings. To embrace art, to create art, to consume art, with each step we free our minds of the red mist that threatens to swallow us whole. We are no longer cursed. We are free."
 embrace_the_carnage:0 "Embrace the Carnage"
 embrace_the_carnage_desc:0 "They call it a curse. That which gives us strength. That which causes all to fear us. We could bring civilisations to their knees. And yet we continue to run from it. Why? This is no curse, but a gift! Embrace it, and in that we find true power."
