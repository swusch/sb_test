#Awen was not elected for his position, the leaders of the militias put him in charge to fix the absolute mess and chaos the city was during the occupation of the city and eventually people just started treating him as the Lord-Mayor. Afterwards he was elected two consecutive times, retiring after restoring full order in the city.
